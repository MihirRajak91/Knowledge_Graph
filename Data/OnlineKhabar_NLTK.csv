Nepali basketball prodigies aim to lift the scene,"Rinchhen Moktan and Bina Mani YounjanRinchhen Moktan and Bina Mani Younjan, aged 18 and 17 respectively, are emerging talents in the Nepali basketball scene.With many calling them the future of Nepali basketball, the two are excelling in different formats of the game. Moktan was part of Nepal’s women’s basketball team that took part in the Asian Games in China while Younjan made her full-court debut during the 2023 SABA Women’s Basketball Championship.Recently, the two helped Budhanilkantha Basketball Club win the U19 Women National Basketball Championship organized by the National Basketball Association with Moktan even earning the coveted title of most valuable player (MVP).“I was so happy to be part of the winning team and be dubbed the MVP in the U19 championship that was held after ages, ” says Moktan.Now, the two hope that more tournaments are held in the country so they can raise their game as they hope to prepare well for international tournaments. They believe that this aspect is currently lacking in their preparation and is essential for them to compete with other countries on the global stage.“We both played internationally for Nepal and found the domestic matches easy. The more we play the better we will get as players and for that, matches are crucial,” says Moktan.Moktan primarily plays as the point guard. This is considered one of the most important positions in the sport as a point guard acts as a floor general. Understanding that she has been learning and trying to improve as she hopes to play many games for Nepal.“I also play as a shooting guard but I love playing the point,” she says.The two have played a match each for the national women’s team, albeit in different formats. Having debuted in their teens, they are eager to make the most of these opportunities and contribute to the team.Building chemistry in the domestic sceneRinchhen Moktan and Bina Mani YounjanBoth Moktan and Younjan are teammates in the domestic scene, initially playing for the Nepal Police Club. They have been consistently playing together on various teams. Their basketball journey began in school, with Younjan starting hers at Rupy’s International School, where she was introduced to the sport by Mabindra Chhetri, a member of the national men’s team.Younjan was not comfortable when she started but with time and thanks to her teammates, she started to learn the game and get better. “I picked it up quite quickly. This is thanks to the senior members of my team,” she says.Upon completing her Secondary Education Examination (SEE), Younjan joined Premier College and joined its basketball team. Currently, in the 12th grade, she and her team have won a tournament that featured both home and away formats.However, Moktan’s road is different as she lived and breathed the sport since her early teens. Her love for basketball started when she was in grade 8. Her passion for basketball led her to join Trungram International Academy, where basketball was a major extra-curricular activity.“I went to TIA for basketball. Then I heard that Anusha Malla and Shreya Khadka also play for TIA. There was a good environment for basketball,” Moktan says.  Currently, Moktan, Younjan, Malla, and Khadka are teammates. Moktan played in the 3×3 basketball during the Asian Games under Khadka’s captaincy.Since Moktan and Younjan have been playing together, the two have developed a chemistry. As Moktan runs the point, Younjan plays as a forward. They know when to cut in and when to hold back as the duo has been causing their opponents some major troubles.“We have played together for various clubs, so there is proper coordination among us,” says Moktan. No I in ‘TEAM’They understand how basketball is a team game and that they need to have each other’s back. Their bond is such that they try to cover for each other’s mistakes as well.Both feel that the sport has changed the way they see life. It has improved their personal growth and even changed their lifestyle to some extent.“It’s given us confidence and helped us build our character,” says Moktan.As the game has given them a name, they hope they can work together in creating history for the country. The only way to do that is by winning medals.“We dream big,” says Moktan.Younjan believes if they can do that, they will be able to take Nepali women’s basketball to new heights.Coach of national women’s basketball Bikash Shahi says it is possible too as he sees great potential in Moktan and Younjan.  “They have what it takes to uplift the Nepali women’s basketball scene,” says Shahi.  Moktan, who has played in 3×3 basketball, now wants to transition to full-court basketball for Nepal. However, both express concern about the irregularity of games, highlighting that consistent gameplay is essential for their development.“We do not participate to lose. Although we can’t win, in every international match we learn something new,” says Younjan. “But for us to compete even harder, we need to play more games.”",['nepali basketbal prodigi aim lift scene'],"['rinchhen moktan bina mani younjanrinchhen moktan bina mani younjan , age 18 17 respect , emerg talent nepali basketbal scene.with mani call futur nepali basketbal , two excel differ format game .', 'moktan part nepal ’ women ’ basketbal team took part asian game china younjan made full-court debut 2023 saba women ’ basketbal championship.rec , two help budhanilkantha basketbal club win u19 women nation basketbal championship organ nation basketbal associ moktan even earn covet titl valuabl player ( mvp ) . “ happi part win team dub mvp u19 championship held age , ” say moktan.now , two hope tournament held countri rais game hope prepar well intern tournament .', 'believ aspect current lack prepar essenti compet countri global stage . “ play intern nepal found domest match easi .', 'play better get player , match crucial , ” say moktan.moktan primarili play point guard .', 'consid one import posit sport point guard act floor gener .', 'understand learn tri improv hope play mani game nepal . “ also play shoot guard love play point , ” says.th two play match nation women ’ team , albeit differ format .', 'debut teen , eager make opportun contribut team.build chemistri domest scenerinchhen moktan bina mani younjanboth moktan younjan teammat domest scene , initi play nepal polic club .', 'consist play togeth variou team .', 'basketbal journey began school , younjan start rupi ’ intern school , introduc sport mabindra chhetri , member nation men ’ team.younjan comfort start time thank teammat , start learn game get better .', '“ pick quit quickli .', 'thank senior member team , ” says.upon complet secondari educ examin ( see ) , younjan join premier colleg join basketbal team .', 'current , 12th grade , team tournament featur home away formats.howev , moktan ’ road differ live breath sport sinc earli teen .', 'love basketbal start grade 8 .', 'passion basketbal led join trungram intern academi , basketbal major extra-curricular activ . “ went tia basketbal .', 'heard anusha malla shreya khadka also play tia .', 'good environ basketbal , ” moktan say .', 'current , moktan , younjan , malla , khadka teammat .', 'moktan play 3×3 basketbal asian game khadka ’ captaincy.sinc moktan younjan play togeth , two develop chemistri .', 'moktan run point , younjan play forward .', 'know cut hold back duo caus oppon major troubl . “ play togeth variou club , proper coordin among us , ” say moktan .', '‘ team ’ understand basketbal team game need ’ back .', 'bond tri cover ’ mistak well.both feel sport chang way see life .', 'improv person growth even chang lifestyl extent . “ ’ given us confid help us build charact , ” say moktan.a game given name , hope work togeth creat histori countri .', 'way win medal . “ dream big , ” say moktan.younjan believ , abl take nepali women ’ basketbal new heights.coach nation women ’ basketbal bikash shahi say possibl see great potenti moktan younjan .', '“ take uplift nepali women ’ basketbal scene , ” say shahi .', 'moktan , play 3×3 basketbal , want transit full-court basketbal nepal .', 'howev , express concern irregular game , highlight consist gameplay essenti develop . “ particip lose .', 'although ’ win , everi intern match learn someth new , ” say younjan .', '“ us compet even harder , need play game . ”']"

Sandeep Lamichhane’s stunning fall from grace,"Nepal cricket team’s former captain Sandeep Lamichhane, being released on bail on January 13, 2023. Photo: Aryan DhimalNo other Nepali cricketer has achieved success like Sandeep Lamichhane. That said, no Nepali cricketer has been convicted of being a rapist either.Kathmandu District Court, on Wednesday, handed Lamichhane an eight-year prison sentence for raping Gaushala 26 by taking advantage of her poor financial condition. The crime he committed not only branded him as a criminal but also cast a shadow over all his success and achievements. He was once dubbed the future of Nepali cricket. When he was selected to play in the Indian Premier League, many pinned him to take Nepali cricket to new heights. But now, after being convicted of rape, Lamichhane’s future in cricket is uncertain.A humble beginning File: Sandeep LamichhaneIt was in 2015 when former national cricket coach Pubudu Dassanayake saw Sandeep Lamichhane, bowling in the nets at Kyampachaur, Chitwan. His bowling skills immediately caught Dassanayake’s attention as he called the then 14-year-old Lamichhane to join the U19 team.It did not take time for him to get into the national team as he made his senior team debut against Namibia in the ICC World Cricket League Championship. There was no stopping him thereafter.In 2018, Sandeep Lamichhane was selected by the Indian Premier League team Delhi Daredevils and played nine matches in two seasons. After becoming the first Nepali cricketer to play in IPL his fame rocketed globally too. Interest started coming in from other T20 leagues too as he took part in Big Bash League, Afghanistan Premier League, Caribbean Premier League and Pakistan Premier League to name a few.He was at the top of the world. Many say he felt invincible. His attitude changed with the stardom he got. Being appointed the national team captain added fuel to the fire as his career and stardom as at the pinnacle.Wrong turn Sandeep Lamichhane.That stardom, however, was not to last as it seemed to have caught up to him.On September 6, 2022, a girl, files a complaint against the then captain of the then Nepal national cricket team, Sandeep Lamichhane, accusing him of raping her in a Kathmandu Hotel on August 22. As the complaint was filed in Kathmandu, Lamichhane was in the Caribbean islands taking part in the Caribbean Premier League in the West Indies.  The news created uproar all over the sports fraternity, globally. The girl, whom police and the court call Gaushala 26, reported to police, that on the eve of the Nepal cricket team’s Kenya departure on August 22, Sandeep Lamichhane asked her to go on a trip to Bhaktapur, and she agreed.As it got late, Gaushala 26 could not go to her hostel as it shut its doors at 8 pm. She said, in the report, Lamichhane told her to stay with him for the night. That is when she said she was raped by Lamichhane who then flew to Kenya with the national cricket team the next day.Two days after a  complaint was filed against Lamichhane on September 8 the Kathmandu District Court issued an arrest warrant against him.  On the same day, the Cricket Association of Nepal, a cricket governing body of Nepal, suspended Lamichhane from the teamOn the runFile: Sandeep LamichhaneAfter an arrest warrant was issued against Lamichhane as he was suspended by CAN, he left his CPL team. He pleaded innocence to charges put against him through his social media account.  However, despite this, Lamichhane did not come to Nepal. He went missing in action. That led to the Department of Immigration blacklisting Lamichhane on September 21 so the police could arrest him as soon as he landed.Seventeen days had passed since the issuance of an arrest warrant against him, yet he remained inaccessible. However, on September 25, he announced through a social media post that he was taking some time off to stay alone to cope with stress but assured his return to address the case. Thereon, on September 26, Nepal Police issued a diffusion notice to all Interpol members, seeking assistance in arresting him.Day of arrest Police arrest Sandeep Lamichhane at the Kathmandu airport, on Thursday, October 6, 2022. Photo: Bikash ShresthaOn October 6, a month after the issuance of an arrest warrant against him, Lamichhane returned to Nepal and was arrested. Despite his earlier statement expressing his intention to surrender, he was arrested as soon as he landed at the Tribhuvan International Airport.99 days in custodyRape-accused cricket star Sandeep Lamichhane leaves the Kathmandu District Court, on Friday, November 4, 2022. Photo: Aryan DhimalLamichhane then spent 99 days in custody after the Kathmandu District Court permitted Nepal Police to detain him as they investigated the case. On October 31, the government attorney’s office filed a lawsuit, demanding a jail sentence of 10 to 12 years, against Sandeep Lamichhane. And on November 4 Lamichhane was sent to judicial custody until the final verdict. Bailed out Nepal cricket team’s former captain Sandeep Lamichhane was released on bail on Friday, January 13, 2023. Photo: Chandra Bahadur AleSurprisingly, on January 12, 2023, the Patan High Court, however, ordered his release on a bail of Rs 2 million.A division bench of Dhruva Raj Nanda and Ramesh Dhakal heard Lamichhane’s appeal for release and decided to let him fight the legal battle staying out of jail. Despite releasing Lamichhane, the court restricted him from going abroad until the final verdict.Back in the business Sandeep Lamichhane celebrates after taking a wicket from Scotland, during a match held under the ICC Men’s Cricket World Cup League 2, in Kathmandu, on Tuesday, February 21, 2023. Photo: Bikash ShresthaHis release on bail then prompted CAN to lift its suspension on January 31 allowing him to play cricket for Nepal. Two days after the CAN lifted his suspension, on February 2, Lamichhane was in camp.The return of Lamichhane to the close camp of the national team received flak from various people. Many protested how an accused rapist could be part of the national team. Many went to the streets demanding he be removed but that did not happen as he was even selected for the team which was playing the last leg of the Cricket World Cup League 2.Despite that, he played the series against Namibia and Scotland. The Scottish players, in solidarity with the survivor, chose not to shake hands with Lamichhane in both games.He even went to the UAE to take on Papua New Guinea and the UAE after the court granted him special privileges.After he received his bail, he took part in 20 ODIs and eight T20Is. Noteworthy among these are matches in prestigious events such as the Asian Games and Asia Cup along with three League 2 series, ODI World Cup Qualifiers, and T20 World Cup Qualifiers.Found guilty However, after 15 months of legal battle, Lamichhane was convicted of rape. The bench, presided over by Judge Shishir Raj Dhakal, has deemed Lamichhane guilty of raping Gaushala 26. The court mandated a separate hearing to determine the duration of imprisonment. Even though Lamichhane was accused of raping a minor, the court dismissed the claim that the girl was a minor when the incident happened. Sentenced to prisonThe District Court, on January 10 sentenced Sandeep Lamichhane to eight years of prison and ordered him to pay compensation of Rs 200,000 to the survivor.  According to the court, Lamichhane raped the survivor taking advantage of her poor financial condition. Despite the conviction, Lamichhane will not face immediate arrest. He has the option to appeal the district court’s decision first at the High Court and, ultimately, at the Supreme Court.The court determined that Lamichhane had violated Section 219 (1, 2, and 3) (e) of the Civil Code 2017, as the act was non-consensual.Suspended from playing cricketThe verdict from the court then prompted the Cricket Association of Nepal to suspend Lamichhane from all forms of cricket. The statement, issued on January 11, said Lamichhane was suspended from playing cricket indefinitely.Letter to CAN Reportedly, Lamichhane has also written a letter to CAN stating that he will not be part of the cricket team until proven innocent. In that letter, he has also requested CAN to release his pending payments as he says he is in a serious financial crisis.",['sandeep lamichhan ’ stun fall grace'],"['nepal cricket team ’ former

Decisions to give 20 per cent of matchday ticket sales to players missing from ANFA minute,"File photoKathmandu, January 4The All Nepal Football Association (ANFA) decision to give 20 per cent of the money collected from matchday tickets to the players has disappeared from its minute.The central working committee meeting of ANFA, held on December 18, 2023, decided to stop the distribution of free passes during international games and to provide 20 per cent of the amount raised from ticket sales to the players.The minutes of the decision from that meeting were forwarded by Kiran Rai, the General Secretary of ANFA, to the senior vice president, vice president, central members, and office bearers on January 1. However, the decision taken on December 18 is absent from it.According to the statute of ANFA, minutes must be sent in writing to the members of the working committee within 15 days of the meeting. Accordingly, in the 17-point minute sent by Kiran Rai to the members of the working committee on Tuesday, the decision made by the working committee regarding proceeds from the matchday ticket being given to players has been removed.The central members of ANFA have raised objections to this situation. They contend that the response received indicates that the minutes included discussions not addressed in the working committee meeting, while crucially omitting the matters that were decided upon.However, ANFA spokesperson Suresh Shah has offered a different explanation, stating that the omission was the result of a typing mistake. According to Shah, the decision was not intentionally removed but was overlooked due to a typing error. Subsequently, the error was rectified, and the corrected minutes were resent.",['decis give 20 per cent matchday ticket sale player miss anfa minut'],"['file photokathmandu , januari 4the nepal footbal associ ( anfa ) decis give 20 per cent money collect matchday ticket player disappear minute.th central work committe meet anfa , held decemb 18 , 2023 , decid stop distribut free pass intern game provid 20 per cent amount rais ticket sale players.th minut decis meet forward kiran rai , gener secretari anfa , senior vice presid , vice presid , central member , offic bearer januari 1 .', 'howev , decis taken decemb 18 absent it.accord statut anfa , minut must sent write member work committe within 15 day meet .', 'accordingli , 17-point minut sent kiran rai member work committe tuesday , decis made work committe regard proce matchday ticket given player removed.th central member anfa rais object situat .', 'contend respons receiv indic minut includ discuss address work committe meet , crucial omit matter decid upon.howev , anfa spokesperson suresh shah offer differ explan , state omiss result type mistak .', 'accord shah , decis intent remov overlook due type error .', 'subsequ , error rectifi , correct minut resent .']"

Bishal Shrestha hangs up gloves after silent dedication on the sidelines,"Bishal Shrestha celebrates as Nepal equalise against India on September 5, 2021.“I am emotional but happy. You have done a lot and achieved a lot. You are an inspiration for many including me. I am always proud of you. Your fan forever.” Bidhya Shrestha, the sister of Bishal Shrestha, posted this on her social media after he announced his retirement from international football on December 22 during the post-match conference after a match between FC Chitwan and Jhapa FC during the Nepal Super League 2023.Since then, the goalkeeper has been receiving an outpouring of messages and wishes from family, friends, and fans. He had never anticipated that his retirement would generate such a buzz within the football fraternity and media. Bishal Shrestha, who had informally retired after not playing a single game during the 2023 SAFF Championship, decided to formally announce it during the post-match conference which took many by surprise.“Everything has a perfect time and I thought that day was perfect to announce retirement,” says Shrestha.Playing the waiting gameBishal Shrestha dives towards the ball during a Nepal Super League match.Bishal Shrestha has been part of the national football since 2011 but the 31-year-old has hardly played. His only appearance for the national team came in 2021 when he came on as a substitute in the 85th minute against India replacing captain Kiran Kumar Limbu. Despite it being a brief cameo, he fondly reminisces about that match as the highlight of his footballing career.“Every boy dreams of playing for the national team and I will forever be thankful to Abdullah Almutairi for sending me in despite Nepal losing 2-0 to India. Those 10 minutes will be with me forever,” says Shrestha.Bishal Shrestha hoped that after that game, more opportunities would come his way, but unfortunately, that has not been the case as he has not played a minute for Nepal since. Recognising the challenges faced by backup goalkeepers, he acknowledges that second-choice goalkeepers often receive fewer chances, and he is no exception to this reality.“Being a goalkeeper is tough in the world of football. If there is one goalkeeper better than us, that’s game over for us most times,” says Shrestha.The course of events could have taken a different turn if Bishal Shrestha had not been injured in 2012. Given that most first-choice goalkeepers were injured during the Nehru Cup in India, there was a significant chance that he could have played. However, the injury delayed his journey to the national team by a year or two.“It is what it is. Luck also plays an important role,” he says.Consistently being second or third in line was demotivating for him. However, his love for the game and his patience acted as enduring sources of motivation, enabling him to stay with the national team and remain hopeful. Furthermore, he received significant support from his family members.“I am happy with whatever I have been able to do for the national team,” says Shrestha.     Bishal Shrestha, who nurtured dreams of representing the national team since childhood, looks back at his time with the national squad as a moment filled with pride and happiness. Reflecting on his experiences, he shares a deep connection with the national team.“I will miss every aspect—the camaraderie in the dressing room, the journeys with teammates, and the intensity of matches,” says Shrestha.A-Division LegendBishal Shrestha Photo: Chandra Bahadur Ale Despite not having the opportunity to play many games for the national team, Bishal Shrestha has been impressive in the A Division League.In the Martyr’s Memorial A Division League in 2022, he achieved an impressive record of keeping 11 clean sheets, going over a thousand minutes without conceding a goal. In recognition of his outstanding performance, he was named the best goalkeeper of the league that year as he conceded only two goals in 13 matches. He played a crucial role in Machhindra Football Club winning a title without losing a single game. In the 2020 season, he also had an outstanding performance, losing only one game as Machhindra secured another league title.In total, Bishal Shrestha has clinched four league titles, securing two with Manang Marshyangdi Club and two with Machhindra Football Club since his debut in the A Division League in 2009.Similarly, Shrestha has also participated in both editions of the Nepal Super League. In the first edition, he played for Butwal-Lumbini Football Club, and in the second edition, he was captain and the marquee player for Football Club Chitwan.During the conversation with Onlinekhabar, Shrestha also highlighted the significance of goalkeepers in football. He pointed out that people often do not credit goalkeepers for victories, but they play a crucial role, handling 50 per cent of the game.“Goalie is a captain without an armband,” he says. “It is a fun and difficult position in football.” Even though Shrestha is no longer part of the national team, he remains equally concerned about the state of Nepali football as he was before.He is worried as footballers continue to leave the country and has said he will stay in Nepal and try to contribute to football in whatever way possible.“I hope football gets more priority so that this exodus stops and I too can continue playing the sport I love,” says Shrestha.To improve the sport, Shrestha urges the All Nepal Football Association (ANFA) to establish a proper calendar for the leagues and strive to host games regularly.“Players will only feel secure staying in the country if there are more games scheduled, providing them with consistent opportunities,” he says.",['bishal shrestha hang glove silent dedic sidelin'],"['bishal shrestha celebr nepal equalis india septemb 5 , 2021 . “ emot happi .', 'done lot achiev lot .', 'inspir mani includ .', 'alway proud .', 'fan forev . ” bidhya shrestha , sister bishal shrestha , post social media announc retir intern footbal decemb 22 post-match confer match fc chitwan jhapa fc nepal super leagu 2023.sinc , goalkeep receiv outpour messag wish famili , friend , fan .', 'never anticip retir would gener buzz within footbal fratern media .', 'bishal shrestha , inform retir play singl game 2023 saff championship , decid formal announc post-match confer took mani surpris . “ everyth perfect time thought day perfect announc retir , ” say shrestha.play wait gamebish shrestha dive toward ball nepal super leagu match.bish shrestha part nation footbal sinc 2011 31-year-old hardli play .', 'appear nation team came 2021 came substitut 85th minut india replac captain kiran kumar limbu .', 'despit brief cameo , fondli reminisc match highlight footbal career . “ everi boy dream play nation team forev thank abdullah almutairi send despit nepal lose 2-0 india .', '10 minut forev , ” say shrestha.bish shrestha hope game , opportun would come way , unfortun , case play minut nepal sinc .', 'recognis challeng face backup goalkeep , acknowledg second-choic goalkeep often receiv fewer chanc , except realiti . “ goalkeep tough world footbal .', 'one goalkeep better us , ’ game us time , ” say shrestha.th cours event could taken differ turn bishal shrestha injur 2012 .', 'given first-choic goalkeep injur nehru cup india , signific chanc could play .', 'howev , injuri delay journey nation team year two . “ .', 'luck also play import role , ” says.consist second third line demotiv .', 'howev , love game patienc act endur sourc motiv , enabl stay nation team remain hope .', 'furthermor , receiv signific support famili member . “ happi whatev abl nation team , ” say shrestha .', 'bishal shrestha , nurtur dream repres nation team sinc childhood , look back time nation squad moment fill pride happi .', 'reflect experi , share deep connect nation team . “ miss everi aspect—th camaraderi dress room , journey teammat , intens match , ” say shrestha.a-divis legendbish shrestha photo : chandra bahadur ale despit opportun play mani game nation team , bishal shrestha impress divis league.in martyr ’ memori divis leagu 2022 , achiev impress record keep 11 clean sheet , go thousand minut without conced goal .', 'recognit outstand perform , name best goalkeep leagu year conced two goal 13 match .', 'play crucial role machhindra footbal club win titl without lose singl game .', '2020 season , also outstand perform , lose one game machhindra secur anoth leagu title.in total , bishal shrestha clinch four leagu titl , secur two manang marshyangdi club two machhindra footbal club sinc debut divis leagu 2009.similarli , shrestha also particip edit nepal super leagu .', 'first edit , play butwal-lumbini footbal club , second edit , captain marque player footbal club chitwan.dur convers onlinekhabar , shrestha also highlight signific goalkeep footbal .', 'point peopl often credit goalkeep victori , play crucial role , handl 50 per cent game . “ goali captain without armband , ” say .', '“ fun difficult posit footbal . ” even though shrestha longer part nation team , remain equal concern state nepali footbal before.h worri footbal continu leav countri said stay nepal tri contribut footbal whatev way possibl . “ hope footbal get prioriti exodu stop continu play sport love , ” say shrestha.to improv sport , shrestha urg nepal footbal associ ( anfa ) establish proper calendar leagu strive host game regularli . “ player feel secur stay countri game schedul , provid consist opportun , ” say .']"

Despite dominating the game, the Thunders could not score another goal as Dhangadhi’s keeper, Mohamad Taha made some good saves to keep Dhangadhi in the game who looked off pace in the first half.The second half, however, was a different story as Dhangadhi started well scoring in the 54th minute to equalise. Despite many chances for both teams, the game ended up going to extra time.The extra time was a cagy affair with both teams looking gassed after a frantic 90 minutes. Stephan Kojo, however, took advantage of some poor defending to give Pokhara the lead in the 103rd minute.Things looked bleak for Dhangadhi but a last-minute goal from Ahmed Hijazi sent the game to penalties which they won 4-3.Pokhara Thunders have another chance to reach the final if they beat the winners of the eliminator between Kathmandu Rayzrs and Lalitpur City FC.",['nepal super leagu 2023 : dhangadhi narrowli edg past pokhara penalti reach final'],"['ahm hijazi celebr score last-minut equal pokhara thunders.kathmandu , decemb 26dhangadhi fc book place final nepal super leagu 2023 beat pokhara thunder penalti monday.in tightli contest match two qualifi 1 nepal super leagu 2023 , dhangadhi narrowli edg pokhara 4-3 penalties.th game start pokhara thunder take earli lead thank ayush ghalan .', 'despit domin game , thunder could score anoth goal dhangadhi ’ keeper , mohamad taha made good save keep dhangadhi game look pace first half.th second half , howev , differ stori dhangadhi start well score 54th minut equalis .', 'despit mani chanc team , game end go extra time.th extra time cagi affair team look gass frantic 90 minut .', 'stephan kojo , howev , took advantag poor defend give pokhara lead 103rd minute.th look bleak dhangadhi last-minut goal ahm hijazi sent game penalti 4-3.pokhara thunder anoth chanc reach final beat winner elimin kathmandu rayzr lalitpur citi fc .']"

Nepal Super League 2023 sees four teams lock horns in battle for championship glory,"The league stage of the Nepal Super League 2023 proved to be a captivating spectacle, marked by a blend of drama, excitement, intense competition among players, and a series of unexpected results.Nepal’s only franchise football league, which started a month ago, witnessed 36 thrilling league matches between nine teams. Following a series of gruelling and dramatic matches, Pokhara Thunders, Dhangadhi FC, Kathmandu Rayzrs, and Lalitpur City FC will compete against each other in the playoffs to be crowned Nepal Super League champions.While Dhangadi, Kathmandu and Lalitpur have all been here before during the first edition of the Nepal Super League, table toppers Pokhara will be taking part in their first as they bid to win the championship with their young team.Standing in their way, however, will be Dhangadi who finished runners-up in the first edition of Nepal Super League held in 2021. Kathmandu, who are the defending champions, will also prove to be a tough test along with Lalitpur who would want to better their third-place finish in the first edition.Pokhara, who narrowly missed the playoffs in 2021 due to goal difference, have clinched the top spot in the standings for the current season. They secured 15 points from eight games, boasting a record of four wins, three draws, and one loss. Dhangadhi claimed the second position with 13 points earned with three wins, four draws, and one loss. Kathmandu finished third accumulating 12 points with three wins, three draws, and two losses. Despite losing two in a row, Lalitpur finished the fourth with 10 points with two wins, four draws and two losses.Lalitpur, however, can consider themselves fortunate as they finished with the same number of points as Jhapa FC and Butwal Lumbini. However, Lalitpur managed to secure a spot in the playoffs by a superior goal difference.4 teams 1 cupThe playoffs will consist of four games, including the final. The first qualifier, scheduled for Monday, will feature a face-off between the top two teams, Pokhara and Dhangadhi. The winner of this match will secure a direct spot in the final while the losing team will still have another opportunity to reach the final in the next qualifier.In their recent league stage encounter, Pokhara and Dhangadhi battled to a draw, with Pokhara scoring a last-minute goal to equalize after Dhangadhi initially took the lead.Tuesday will see Kathmandu take on Lalitpur in the eliminator. If the last game between them is anything to go by, this valley derby where the loser will go home will likely see a record crowd for an NSL match.The winner of this match will then face the loser of Pokhara and Dhangadi on Thursday to book a ticket to the final of the Nepal Super League 2023 on Saturday. All matches during the playoff will start at 5.30 pm.

Nepal Super League: Drama expected in the last 4 matches of the league stage,"Kathmandu, December 22The Nepal Super League 2023 is gaining momentum with each passing game. Recent match outcomes have intensified the excitement, particularly as teams vie for the top four playoff spots.In the ongoing nine-team tournament, 32 out of 36 league stage matches have been played, leaving only two playoff berths up for grabs. With only four league games left, the four teams advancing to the playoffs in the Nepal Super League will be determined on Saturday evening.So far, Pokhara Thunders and Dhangadhi FC have already secured their spots in the playoffs, while four teams, Jhapa FC, Lalitpur FC, Kathmandu Razyrs and Birgunj United, are competing for the remaining two positions.Sporting Ilam FC, Butwal Lumbini FC, and FC Chitwan have been officially eliminated from the playoff contention.Dramatic weekThis week’s Nepal Super League games produced surprising results, with title-contending teams facing unexpected losses. The excitement kicked off with a 1-1 draw between defending champions Kathmandu Rayzrs and former runners-up Dhangadhi FC on Monday. On Tuesday, Sporting Ilam, who were out of the playoff contention, beat Lalitpur City FC 1-0 ending their unbeaten run in Nepal Super League 2023. A win against Ilam would have taken Lalitpur to the playoffs but now have a tough match against Kathmandu in the city derby.On Wednesday, Jhapa injected more drama into the league by securing a 2-0 victory over Dhangadhi FC. Jhapa, who were reduced to 10 men, blew the table wide open with this win thanks to a talismanic performance from captain Anjan Bista.On Thursday more fuel was added to the fire after Birgunj United came from behind to beat defending champions Kathmandu Rayzrs 4-1. Kathmandu were all but set to get to the playoffs, but Ghanaian William Opoku had other ideas as he scored an impressive hat trick, including two in two minutes, to take the game away from the defending champions. This win has given Birgunj a great chance to qualify for the playoffs.The recent defeat could prove costly for Kathmandu, forcing them to win their last league match against Lalitpur to stay in the race for defending the title. It sets the stage for a do-or-die situation for Kathmandu.Kathmandu’s head coach, Bal Gopal Maharjan, acknowledged the team’s subpar performance, saying, “This is the biggest loss in my coaching career. I have never experienced anything like this.”The Nepal Super League has become increasingly thrilling as title contenders have suffered consecutive losses, adding an extra layer of excitement to the league.The tables have turnedAs of now, only Pokhara Thunders have secured a place in the playoffs and are poised to finish in the top two, especially considering recent setbacks for Kathmandu and Lalitpur. Finishing first or second will be crucial for Pokhara, providing them with two chances to reach the final scheduled for December 30.Pokhara Thunders are on the top of the table with 14 points from seven games. Their final league match is against Dhangadhi FC on Friday. Former runners-up, Dhangadhi FC, are currently in second position with 12 points.Their match will determine who finishes top. A draw would be sufficient for Pokhara to maintain the top spot. Alternatively, Dhangadhi can secure the top position by defeating Pokhara, setting the stage for the first qualifier between the two teams.Lalitpur City FC and Jhapa FC currently hold the third and fourth positions in the league standings with 10 points each. Former champions Kathmandu Ragers are in fifth place with nine points from seven games. Birgunj, after beating Kathmandu, holds the sixth position with eight points, keeping their chances of securing a top-four spot alive.On Friday, Jhapa FC will face FC Chitwan in a crucial match where a victory would almost certainly secure their place in the eliminator. Simultaneously, Birgunj United, in their match against Butwal Lumbini, will be seeking a win to propel them into the playoffs. The final match featuring Kathmandu against Lalitpur is anticipated to be intense, as it is a must-win game for Kathmandu if they harbour any aspirations of clinching a playoff berth.",['nepal super leagu : drama expect last 4 match leagu stage'],"['kathmandu , decemb 22the nepal super leagu 2023 gain momentum pass game .', 'recent match outcom intensifi excit , particularli team vie top four playoff spots.in ongo nine-team tournament , 32 36 leagu stage match play , leav two playoff berth grab .', 'four leagu game left , four team advanc playoff nepal super leagu determin saturday evening.so far , pokhara thunder dhangadhi fc alreadi secur spot playoff , four team , jhapa fc , lalitpur fc , kathmandu razyr birgunj unit , compet remain two positions.sport ilam fc , butwal lumbini fc , fc chitwan offici elimin playoff contention.dramat weekthi week ’ nepal super leagu game produc surpris result , title-contend team face unexpect loss .', 'excit kick 1-1 draw defend champion kathmandu rayzr former runners-up dhangadhi fc monday .', 'tuesday , sport ilam , playoff content , beat lalitpur citi fc 1-0 end unbeaten run nepal super leagu 2023 .', 'win ilam would taken lalitpur playoff tough match kathmandu citi derby.on wednesday , jhapa inject drama leagu secur 2-0 victori dhangadhi fc .', 'jhapa , reduc 10 men , blew tabl wide open win thank talisman perform captain anjan bista.on thursday fuel ad fire birgunj unit came behind beat defend champion kathmandu rayzr 4-1 .', 'kathmandu set get playoff , ghanaian william opoku idea score impress hat trick , includ two two minut , take game away defend champion .', 'win given birgunj great chanc qualifi playoffs.th recent defeat could prove costli kathmandu , forc win last leagu match lalitpur stay race defend titl .', 'set stage do-or-di situat kathmandu.kathmandu ’ head coach , bal gopal maharjan , acknowledg team ’ subpar perform , say , “ biggest loss coach career .', 'never experienc anyth like thi . ” nepal super leagu becom increasingli thrill titl contend suffer consecut loss , ad extra layer excit league.th tabl turneda , pokhara thunder secur place playoff pois finish top two , especi consid recent setback kathmandu lalitpur .', 'finish first second crucial pokhara , provid two chanc reach final schedul decemb 30.pokhara thunder top tabl 14 point seven game .', 'final leagu match dhangadhi fc friday .', 'former runners-up , dhangadhi fc , current second posit 12 points.their match determin finish top .', 'draw would suffici pokhara maintain top spot .', 'altern , dhangadhi secur top posit defeat pokhara , set stage first qualifi two teams.lalitpur citi fc jhapa fc current hold third fourth posit leagu stand 10 point .', 'former champion kathmandu rager fifth place nine point seven game .', 'birgunj , beat kathmandu , hold sixth posit eight point , keep chanc secur top-four spot alive.on friday , jhapa fc face fc chitwan crucial match victori would almost certainli secur place elimin .', 'simultan , birgunj unit , match butwal lumbini , seek win propel playoff .', 'final match featur kathmandu lalitpur anticip intens , must-win game kathmandu harbour aspir clinch playoff berth .']"

Photo by Miguel Bruna on UnsplashIn 2023, Barbie named Women in Sports as their career of the year.Whenever I am out and about socially, there is always someone who seems pretty certain about not considering my profession as mainstream. Hold up! Sports as a career? In Nepal? You bet! This article aims to explain why women in this male-dominant sports industry in Nepal should not be viewed as a surprise.I have been part of the Nepali cricket industry in a private capacity for quite a while now. Armed with a Master’s Degree in IT from an American University, my choice to stick with sports management tends to raise eyebrows. While I am not an on-field player, I am definitely behind the scenes, playing strong games of serious deliverance with my team. We are all about creating what is not there.As untouched and less discussed as the sports management industry is in Nepal, it has ample room to showcase creativity. Being a commanding woman in a position can be challenging, but on the brighter side, the gender advantage has yet to fail me. As alien as I might be in sports management in Nepal, I have been accepted with open arms. The nature of the job is highly competitive, no doubt.Embraced by the sports fraternityPhoto: PixabayWomen in sports are safe, heard, and welcomed. I absolutely relish the addition of spirited women to the team. The nuances of sports are something women complement greatly. Sports management inherently rejects narrow minds. There is a lot of travelling, meeting people, experimenting, and remembering limitations. The adjustments are both trivial and clever. Often, in our part of the world, societal norms limit women from making career decisions, hindering them from living life on their terms. This restriction potentially keeps many capable women from pursuing the sports industry, where they could truly wield their power to make an impact. Change is gradual, and I hope to see numerous female faces in charge of stadiums someday in Nepal.Yes, there are challenges. It ranges from personal sacrifices to job security and opportunities. However, these are workable factors for any freelancer in sports management. The key is excelling at our jobs to thrive anywhere. Taking a page from the medical field, the seriousness we apply there should not differ in sports management. Sports is a powerful industry. Children grow up idolising what we showcase on TV. As glorious as the game is, it is every child’s dream to represent their country someday. Carrying that responsibility is our role in sports—an often thankless yet deeply satisfying job.Nepali sports industryThe fans went wild at TU Cricket Ground after Nepal beat UAE.Sports may be a smaller industry in Nepal, but globally, it is a behemoth. The world economy has shifted, and it is time we alter our perspective to recognise the potential of sports as an industry in Nepal. The idea of open commercialisation of sports remains somewhat unexplored, as it continues to be a more exclusive affair in Nepal. By sourcing innovative ideas, there’s a wealth of public attention and investment waiting to be tapped into, along with numerous practices to establish and discard. As the Nepali team achieves international records, the packaging of the sport becomes everything. There is plenty to learn from international sports management to make our industry highly marketable and poised for global entry.Sports such as cricket, football, volleyball, or even golf serve as key intersections for reshaping Nepal’s global narrative. Over the years, Kabaddi has witnessed a substantial surge in India, both in terms of viewership and commercial success. The primary challenge we grapple with is Nepal’s comparatively small market size, posing constraints on our ability to generate substantial economic gains. Therefore, there is unanimous agreement on the imperative for Nepal’s sports to venture onto the international stage.Nepal boasts many hardworking individuals, yet achieving this goal demands specialised talents in sports management with the requisite experience and the capacity to enhance existing values. In the long run, outsourcing such talents may foster dependence. Hence, a concerted effort is needed to inspire Nepali youth to engage in sports management, contributing to our sports ecosystem. There are various ways in which we can harness the potential of sports for our benefit. Encouraging youth involvement can be instrumental in capitalising on the multifaceted opportunities presented by the sports industry. There is a lot to explore if you think about it.",['post navig'],"['untouch less discuss sport manag industri nepal , ampl room showcas creativ .', 'photo miguel bruna unsplashin 2023 , barbi name women sport career year.whenev social , alway someon seem pretti certain consid profess mainstream .', 'hold !', 'sport career ?', 'nepal ?', 'bet !', 'articl aim explain women male-domin sport industri nepal view surprise.i part nepali cricket industri privat capac quit .', 'arm master ’ degre american univers , choic stick sport manag tend rais eyebrow .', 'on-field player , definit behind scene , play strong game seriou deliver team .', 'creat there.a untouch less discuss sport manag industri nepal , ampl room showcas creativ .', 'command woman posit challeng , brighter side , gender advantag yet fail .', 'alien might sport manag nepal , accept open arm .', 'natur job highli competit , doubt.embrac sport fraternityphoto : pixabaywomen sport safe , heard , welcom .', 'absolut relish addit spirit women team .', 'nuanc sport someth women complement greatli .', 'sport manag inher reject narrow mind .', 'lot travel , meet peopl , experi , rememb limit .', 'adjust trivial clever .', 'often , part world , societ norm limit women make career decis , hinder live life term .', 'restrict potenti keep mani capabl women pursu sport industri , could truli wield power make impact .', 'chang gradual , hope see numer femal face charg stadium someday nepal.y , challeng .', 'rang person sacrific job secur opportun .', 'howev , workabl factor freelanc sport manag .', 'key excel job thrive anywher .', 'take page medic field , serious appli differ sport manag .', 'sport power industri .', 'children grow idolis showcas tv .', 'gloriou game , everi child ’ dream repres countri someday .', 'carri respons role sports—an often thankless yet deepli satisfi job.nepali sport industryth fan went wild tu cricket ground nepal beat uae.sport may smaller industri nepal , global , behemoth .', 'world economi shift , time alter perspect recognis potenti sport industri nepal .', 'idea open commercialis sport remain somewhat unexplor , continu exclus affair nepal .', 'sourc innov idea , ’ wealth public attent invest wait tap , along numer practic establish discard .', 'nepali team achiev intern record , packag sport becom everyth .', 'plenti learn intern sport manag make industri highli market pois global entry.sport cricket , footbal , volleybal , even golf serv key intersect reshap nepal ’ global narr .', 'year , kabaddi wit substanti surg india , term viewership commerci success .', 'primari challeng grappl nepal ’ compar small market size , pose constraint abil gener substanti econom gain .', 'therefor , unanim agreement imper nepal ’ sport ventur onto intern stage.nep boast mani hardwork individu , yet achiev goal demand specialis talent sport manag requisit experi capac enhanc exist valu .', 'long run , outsourc talent may foster depend .', 'henc , concert effort need inspir nepali youth engag sport manag , contribut sport ecosystem .', 'variou way har potenti sport benefit .', 'encourag youth involv instrument capitalis multifacet opportun present sport industri .', 'lot explor think .']"
Women in sports management can make a difference ,"Painting ‘My Private Life’ by artist Priyam Pradhan at the exhibition Mani at Siddhartha Art Gallery, Baber Mahal. Photo: Chandra Bahadur AleUsing Pitt’s artist pen on paper, artist Priyam Pradhan presents My Private Life, a showcase of the current significance of his life depicted in abstract form.At the centre of the painting is a 1000-rupee note, within which Pradhan has intricately painted Lord Krishna, a man wearing a hoodie tenderly embracing his dog, and a woman. The woman stands tall, elongated in form. Towards the bottom of the canvas, a holy man reaches out his hands, appearing to be in flight.Priyam Pradhan has used a vibrant colour palette, incorporating bright hues such as pink, orange, and yellow, as well as green, black, white, and grey. This combination adds a dynamic and lively quality to the artwork.“The man in the centre is me and the girl in green is my girlfriend. And the faces are my mom and dad,” says Pradhan. “The sadhu (holy man) symbolises my desires that I don’t have many desires for materialistic things however I do understand the value of money.”The use of colours, figures and lines in an abstract form in his painting resembles the painting of American painter Paul Jackson Pollock. Like his abstract expressionism, Pradhan has expressed himself in his painting.Furthermore, this marks Priyam Pradhan’s third solo painting exhibition titled Mani (money), inaugurated on January 17 at Siddhartha Art Gallery, Baber Mahal.In his previous exhibitions, Pradhan’s artworks centred around Hindu philosophy and his spontaneous thought process. However, in this latest exhibition, he explores the theme of money and its impact on an individual’s life, delving into the reverberating effects of financial aspects.Understanding the value of moneyPaintings by artist Priyam Pradhan at Siddhartha Art Gallery, Baber Mahal. Photo: Chandra Bahadur AleAny form of art is known as a reflection of the contemporary time. Likewise, Priyam Pradhan’s paintings reflect the lifestyle, desires, obligations and more of today’s younger generation living in urban areas in Nepal.Pradhan himself is in his 20s and he has justified the want of most of the youngsters in their 20s, who might be declared adults and understand the need for money and materialistic things but are still kids at their heart who want to explore and experience life as much as possible.The exhibition has 27 paintings which Pradhan took around nine months to complete. According to him, while he was travelling the idea that his life was luxurious and him being capable of exploring anything he wanted to was because of money.And being an artist this concept lingered on him and he was compelled to create on the theme of money.Once you enter the gallery, you can also view an animated video, which introduces artist Pradhan and the importance of money, which is on the ground floor. On the first floor, a huge painting (193×62 in cm) Apatkalin Awastha using mixed media on canvas welcomes you and other paintings are small in size (18×30 in cm).“It is a team work and it is my introduction as an artist for the exhibition,” he says. “Also, being a recent multimedia graduate from Islington College, I wanted to explore my skills and I got my team. Then, like money, multimedia is relevant to current society.”Experiencing life through artPainting by artist Priyam Pradhan at Siddhartha Art Gallery, Baber Mahal. Photo: Chandra Bahadur Ale Priyam Pradhan says enjoyment is the meaning of life and he enjoys creating artwork. Moreover, Pradhan who came into the art world first being a tattoo artist feels blessed that he has the privilege to explore whatever he likes in his life.He also believes that the philosophy that says one should not be materialistic is wrong. “If material things are not important, why would one build a house? And after building a house why do they want to decorate their house?” he questions.Alongside, money and materialistic things, his paintings also explore love, romance, life and childhood experiences. Motifs like Pokemon, ramen noodles, animals, dancers, etc have been used in his paintings. In most of his paintings, he has used numerous white lines in wavy form and these lines for Pradhan indicate the sound or the energy that exists in the surroundings all the time.About using a pitta artist pen, he says, “I have enjoyed drawing and painting since my childhood and using a pitta artist pen helps me revisit that feeling of happiness and sense of freedom.”So many things happening on the canvas with the use of vibrant colours gives a sense of excitement to the viewers. Though referencing artists like Pollock, MF Husain, Picasso and more, his pen strokes give a sense of newness through his expression and thoughts about his life experiences.In his paintings, these bright colours and motifs are in harmony and are visual treats that can surely cheer up the mood of any visitor. Moreover, you can also get free stickers from the artist.If you too are in a gloomy mood and want to uplift a little, visit the exhibition that continues till February 6.",['women sport manag make differ'],"['paint ‘ privat life ’ artist priyam pradhan exhibit mani siddhartha art galleri , baber mahal .', 'photo : chandra bahadur aleus pitt ’ artist pen paper , artist priyam pradhan present privat life , showcas current signific life depict abstract form.at centr paint 1000-rupe note , within pradhan intric paint lord krishna , man wear hoodi tenderli embrac dog , woman .', 'woman stand tall , elong form .', 'toward bottom canva , holi man reach hand , appear flight.priyam pradhan use vibrant colour palett , incorpor bright hue pink , orang , yellow , well green , black , white , grey .', 'combin add dynam live qualiti artwork . “ man centr girl green girlfriend .', 'face mom dad , ” say pradhan .', '“ sadhu ( holi man ) symbolis desir ’ mani desir materialist thing howev understand valu money . ” use colour , figur line abstract form paint resembl paint american painter paul jackson pollock .', 'like abstract expression , pradhan express painting.furthermor , mark priyam pradhan ’ third solo paint exhibit titl mani ( money ) , inaugur januari 17 siddhartha art galleri , baber mahal.in previou exhibit , pradhan ’ artwork centr around hindu philosophi spontan thought process .', 'howev , latest exhibit , explor theme money impact individu ’ life , delv reverber effect financi aspects.understand valu moneypaint artist priyam pradhan siddhartha art galleri , baber mahal .', 'photo : chandra bahadur aleani form art known reflect contemporari time .', 'likewis , priyam pradhan ’ paint reflect lifestyl , desir , oblig today ’ younger gener live urban area nepal.pradhan 20 justifi want youngster 20 , might declar adult understand need money materialist thing still kid heart want explor experi life much possible.th exhibit 27 paint pradhan took around nine month complet .', 'accord , travel idea life luxuri capabl explor anyth want money.and artist concept linger compel creat theme money.onc enter galleri , also view anim video , introduc artist pradhan import money , ground floor .', 'first floor , huge paint ( 193×62 cm ) apatkalin awastha use mix media canva welcom paint small size ( 18×30 cm ) . “ team work introduct artist exhibit , ” say .', '“ also , recent multimedia graduat islington colleg , want explor skill got team .', ', like money , multimedia relev current societi . ” experienc life artpaint artist priyam pradhan siddhartha art galleri , baber mahal .', 'photo : chandra bahadur ale priyam pradhan say enjoy mean life enjoy creat artwork .', 'moreov , pradhan came art world first tattoo artist feel bless privileg explor whatev like life.h also believ philosophi say one materialist wrong .', '“ materi thing import , would one build hous ?', 'build hous want decor hous ? ” questions.alongsid , money materialist thing , paint also explor love , romanc , life childhood experi .', 'motif like pokemon , ramen noodl , anim , dancer , etc use paint .', 'paint , use numer white line wavi form line pradhan indic sound energi exist surround time.about use pitta artist pen , say , “ enjoy draw paint sinc childhood use pitta artist pen help revisit feel happi sens freedom . ” mani thing happen canva use vibrant colour give sens excit viewer .', 'though referenc artist like pollock , mf husain , picasso , pen stroke give sens new express thought life experiences.in paint , bright colour motif harmoni visual treat sure cheer mood visitor .', 'moreov , also get free sticker artist.if gloomi mood want uplift littl , visit exhibit continu till februari 6 .']"
Priyam Pradhan explores the essence of money and life in ‘Mani’ ,"Entrepreneurship education is not just an investment in the education system; it is an investment in the nation’s future prosperity. Photo: Pexels/ Rodnae ProductionsIn the shadow of the towering Himalayas, Nepal faces a challenge that rivals the steepness of its mountainous terrain- the challenge of economic development. As the nation earnestly pursues its Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), it becomes increasingly evident that a transformation in the education system is not only necessary but also urgent. Rooted in common living strategies, the prevailing education model, especially in higher education, may not adequately prepare the youth for the demands of the modern world. In this critical juncture, the incorporation of entrepreneurship education emerges as a beacon of hope, offering a pathway towards a self-reliant and prosperous Nepal.Time to reevaluate the education systemNepal’s journey towards economic prosperity has been marked by challenges that demand innovative solutions. The commitment of the SDGs reflects not only a global responsibility but also a domestic imperative for sustainable development. For this, it is high time to reevaluate the education system in the country.The current education system in Nepal, deeply entrenched in common living strategies, has been the foundation of learning for generations. However, in the face of a rapidly evolving world, today’s generation aspires for more than the status quo. The call for independence reverberates through the aspirations of youth who seek a curriculum fostering critical thinking, innovation and entrepreneurial skills.Entrepreneurship education is a dynamic force capable of reshaping Nepal’s educational landscape. This innovative approach moves beyond traditional learning methods, providing students with the tools to navigate the complexities of the modern world. At its core, entrepreneurship education is about empowering students to implement learned information in practical and tangible ways.Consider a student engrossed in the intricacies of sensor systems during a science class, entrepreneurship education transforms this theoretical knowledge into practical applications, inspiring the creation of a sensor-operated door. Such innovation born from a fusion of science and entrepreneurship becomes a valuable mindset in solving practical problems.  Expanding the horizons of entrepreneurship education, let us delve into chemistry. Imagine students studying chemistry not just as a theoretical subject, but also as entrepreneurs in the making. Armed with entrepreneurial principles, these students can tap into Nepal’s rich biodiversity, exploring market demands for products derived from local plants.In the scenario, chemistry students could embark on a journey to develop performance-enhancing products based on market demand, harnessing the potential of indigenous flora. What makes this approach remarkable is that it does not necessarily require sophisticated machines or extensive human resources. Instead, it leverages the inherent skills and awareness of individuals within the community, paving the way for a grassroots economic revolution.Entrepreneurship in education Representational graphic. Image: FreepikThe beauty of entrepreneurship education lies in its universal applicability. It is not confined to science or chemistry alone. Consider an art student, for example. Through entrepreneurship education, they can understand what art to develop (product), how much to set the price (price), where to sell (place) and how to sell (promote) their artworks. Every subject becomes a canvas for innovation and enterprise.Moreover, entrepreneurship education is a powerful equaliser, recognising the unique skills and talents of individuals across various disciplines. It is not about fitting into a predefined mould but rather about unleashing the potential within each student. When every single person is aware of their skills and potential, they can rise to different levels, contributing to the overall progress of the nation.Entrepreneurship education goes beyond skill recognition; it is about nurturing the ability to produce goods and mastering the art of marketing. Returning to the example of the student developing a sensor-operated door, entrepreneurship education not only equips them to produce the product but also teaches them how to navigate the complexities of marketing it to potential users and clients.The impact of entrepreneurship education extends beyond individual success stories; it reverberates through the entire nation. A generation equipped with entrepreneurial skills becomes a driving force for economic growth and independence. They will be able to recognise the resources and ideas to utilise them to reach the global market. They will be able to be the pioneers in products and contribute to the economy. By fostering a culture of innovation, creativity and self-reliance, Nepal can reduce its dependence on external sources and strengthen its economy from within.In essence, entrepreneurship education is not just an investment in the education system; it is an investment in the nation’s future prosperity. It is a transformative force that has the potential to shape a generation of independent thinkers, innovators and entrepreneurs- the architects of a self-reliant and economically vibrant Nepal. Entrepreneurship education, by teaching students to utilise available resources (physical and financial) and make them commercial, becomes a cornerstone in the nation’s journey towards economic empowerment and independence.",['priyam pradhan explor essenc money life ‘ mani ’'],"['entrepreneurship educ invest educ system ; invest nation ’ futur prosper .', 'photo : pexels/ rodna productionsin shadow tower himalaya , nepal face challeng rival steep mountain terrain- challeng econom develop .', 'nation earnestli pursu sustain develop goal ( sdg ) , becom increasingli evid transform educ system necessari also urgent .', 'root common live strategi , prevail educ model , especi higher educ , may adequ prepar youth demand modern world .', 'critic junctur , incorpor entrepreneurship educ emerg beacon hope , offer pathway toward self-reli prosper nepal.tim reevalu educ systemnep ’ journey toward econom prosper mark challeng demand innov solut .', 'commit sdg reflect global respons also domest imper sustain develop .', ', high time reevalu educ system country.th current educ system nepal , deepli entrench common live strategi , foundat learn gener .', 'howev , face rapidli evolv world , today ’ gener aspir statu quo .', 'call independ reverber aspir youth seek curriculum foster critic think , innov entrepreneuri skills.entrepreneurship educ dynam forc capabl reshap nepal ’ educ landscap .', 'innov approach move beyond tradit learn method , provid student tool navig complex modern world .', 'core , entrepreneurship educ empow student implement learn inform practic tangibl ways.consid student engross intricaci sensor system scienc class , entrepreneurship educ transform theoret knowledg practic applic , inspir creation sensor-oper door .', 'innov born fusion scienc entrepreneurship becom valuabl mindset solv practic problem .', 'expand horizon entrepreneurship educ , let us delv chemistri .', 'imagin student studi chemistri theoret subject , also entrepreneur make .', 'arm entrepreneuri principl , student tap nepal ’ rich biodivers , explor market demand product deriv local plants.in scenario , chemistri student could embark journey develop performance-enhanc product base market demand , har potenti indigen flora .', 'make approach remark necessarili requir sophist machin extens human resourc .', 'instead , leverag inher skill awar individu within commun , pave way grassroot econom revolution.entrepreneurship educ represent graphic .', 'imag : freepikth beauti entrepreneurship educ lie univers applic .', 'confin scienc chemistri alon .', 'consid art student , exampl .', 'entrepreneurship educ , understand art develop ( product ) , much set price ( price ) , sell ( place ) sell ( promot ) artwork .', 'everi subject becom canva innov enterprise.moreov , entrepreneurship educ power equalis , recognis uniqu skill talent individu across variou disciplin .', 'fit predefin mould rather unleash potenti within student .', 'everi singl person awar skill potenti , rise differ level , contribut overal progress nation.entrepreneurship educ goe beyond skill recognit ; nurtur abil produc good master art market .', 'return exampl student develop sensor-oper door , entrepreneurship educ equip produc product also teach navig complex market potenti user clients.th impact entrepreneurship educ extend beyond individu success stori ; reverber entir nation .', 'gener equip entrepreneuri skill becom drive forc econom growth independ .', 'abl recognis resourc idea utilis reach global market .', 'abl pioneer product contribut economi .', 'foster cultur innov , creativ self-reli , nepal reduc depend extern sourc strengthen economi within.in essenc , entrepreneurship educ invest educ system ; invest nation ’ futur prosper .', 'transform forc potenti shape gener independ thinker , innov entrepreneurs- architect self-reli econom vibrant nepal .', 'entrepreneurship educ , teach student utilis avail resourc ( physic financi ) make commerci , becom cornerston nation ’ journey toward econom empower independ .']"

Santoshi Shrestha wins gold on marathon debut ,"Ram Bujhaun Yadav with his land ownership certificate stands near a border pillar which he says was erroneously placed on his land. In October 2023, when 51-year-old Ram Bujhaun Yadav of Musaharnia Rural Municipality-5, Mukhiyapatti, Dhanusha, was at a relative’s house, someone told him that two Indian Sashastra Seema Bal (SSB) personnel were looking for him.Anxious, he rushed home wondering why they were looking for him.“They asked me if the paddy field in the no man’s land was mine. I told them yes and they asked me to cut down the paddy immediately,” he said.The paddy was not ripe and Yadav asked them for some time. However, the SSB personnel told him he had to cut down his paddy immediately.Ram Bujhaun and his wife Tetari Devi each own a 677-square-metre plot of land. As Nepal and India reevaluated the border, Ram Bujhan’s land was been deemed to be near the no man’s land as it now has two demarcation pillars.Frustrated, Ram Bujhaun cut the paddy before it was due to be harvested. Now, he has been asked to not plant anything on the land as it falls in the no man’s land.“Our border police don’t say a word. I can’t fight the SSB on my own,” says Ram Bujhaun adding he had decided not to plan anything on the land anymore.Woes of the farmersMany farmers in southern Nepal say their land has now been placed in India after the recent demarcation. When the Jamuna River, which flows through the no man’s land between Nepal and India, changed its course some two decades ago, some border pillars went missing. Locals say these pillars have now been placed encroaching on Nepali land.In 2018, with the then Chief District Officer of Dhanusha, Pradeep Raj Kandel, and an official from Madhubani district, Bihar, India, a team that included border security forces from both countries, the Armed Police Force of Nepal, and SSB of India began placing border pillars after land measurement by technicians.Locals have raised concerns, stating that border pillars have been positioned, encroaching approximately 50 to 100 meters of land into Nepal compared to the previous position. Many like Ram Bujhaun are unaware of when these border pillars were placed.“I did not know that pillar was placed here. After I found out when I asked the village leaders, many said they were placing the border pillars as they pleased,” said Ram Bujhaun.He was told to carry on planting paddy and that it would not matter as these issues had happened in the past. “They encroached on my land and have asked me not to plant anything. This is gross injustice,” he says.Ram Bujhaun’s family owns a total of 4,000 square metres of land, with 2,000 square metres belonging to him and the remaining 2,000 square metres to his brother Bechan. However, 1,000 square metres of his land is now located on the Indian side after the demarcation. Despite this, he has been farming on the land and continues to pay taxes to the Department of Land Management and Archive in Nepal.“They have marked my land to be on the Indian side and placed border pillars on it. I’ve been farming till now but I don’t know when they will ask me to stop,” he says.Ignorance of the governmentThe Madhesh province in southern NepalThe former ward chair of Mukhiyapatti Musharniya Rural Municipality-5, Ram Naresh Yadav, said that over time, India has encroached on numerous Nepali lands in various locations in the Madhesh Province. This, he says, happened due to the Nepali administration’s ignorance and weak stature.“They (Nepali administration) were careless and that meant the Indian side placed these border pillars by encroaching on Nepali land,” says Ram Naresh.He said that over 40 farmers from wards 1, 5, and 6 have land ranging from 300 to 1,600 square metres on the Indian side. “These farmers have land ownership certificates, but they cannot farm as the SSB says the land is in India and not Nepal,” said Ram Naresh.In 1996, land ownership certificates were distributed after surveying the land in the border area. Local Dharmendra Kumar Yadav said that since then, the locals have been paying their land tax regularly. In 2018, when the pillar was being placed, the locals protested when they saw their land was being encroached on. However, since the demarcation had been agreed upon by high-ranking government officials of Nepal and India, the farmer’s voices went unheard.“We tried to stop when the border pillars were being placed on our land. But the administrators from both sides forcibly put it there without even trying to hold a discussion,” said Harish Chandra Yadav. The Chief District Officer of Dhanusha, Chakrapani Pandey, says that the border pillars were placed by the technical team after the measurements and with the agreement of the high-ranking officials of the two countries.“The fields and houses that are built in no man’s land have recently been cleared. No one can do anything in this particular area,” said Pandey. “We understand the people’s concern but we cannot do anything about it now.”",['santoshi shrestha win gold marathon debut'],"['ram bujhaun yadav land ownership certif stand near border pillar say erron place land .', 'octob 2023 , 51-year-old ram bujhaun yadav musaharnia rural municipality-5 , mukhiyapatti , dhanusha , rel ’ hous , someon told two indian sashastra seema bal ( ssb ) personnel look him.anxi , rush home wonder look him . “ ask paddi field man ’ land mine .', 'told ye ask cut paddi immedi , ” said.th paddi ripe yadav ask time .', 'howev , ssb personnel told cut paddi immediately.ram bujhaun wife tetari devi 677-square-metr plot land .', 'nepal india reevalu border , ram bujhan ’ land deem near man ’ land two demarc pillars.frustr , ram bujhaun cut paddi due harvest .', ', ask plant anyth land fall man ’ land . “ border polic ’ say word .', '’ fight ssb , ” say ram bujhaun ad decid plan anyth land anymore.wo farmersmani farmer southern nepal say land place india recent demarc .', 'jamuna river , flow man ’ land nepal india , chang cours two decad ago , border pillar went miss .', 'local say pillar place encroach nepali land.in 2018 , chief district offic dhanusha , pradeep raj kandel , offici madhubani district , bihar , india , team includ border secur forc countri , arm polic forc nepal , ssb india began place border pillar land measur technicians.loc rais concern , state border pillar posit , encroach approxim 50 100 meter land nepal compar previou posit .', 'mani like ram bujhaun unawar border pillar place . “ know pillar place .', 'found ask villag leader , mani said place border pillar pleas , ” said ram bujhaun.h told carri plant paddi would matter issu happen past .', '“ encroach land ask plant anyth .', 'gross injustic , ” says.ram bujhaun ’ famili own total 4,000 squar metr land , 2,000 squar metr belong remain 2,000 squar metr brother bechan .', 'howev , 1,000 squar metr land locat indian side demarc .', 'despit , farm land continu pay tax depart land manag archiv nepal . “ mark land indian side place border pillar .', '’ farm till ’ know ask stop , ” says.ignor governmentth madhesh provinc southern nepalth former ward chair mukhiyapatti musharniya rural municipality-5 , ram naresh yadav , said time , india encroach numer nepali land variou locat madhesh provinc .', ', say , happen due nepali administr ’ ignor weak statur . “ ( nepali administr ) careless meant indian side place border pillar encroach nepali land , ” say ram naresh.h said 40 farmer ward 1 , 5 , 6 land rang 300 1,600 squar metr indian side .', '“ farmer land ownership certif , farm ssb say land india nepal , ” said ram naresh.in 1996 , land ownership certif distribut survey land border area .', 'local dharmendra kumar yadav said sinc , local pay land tax regularli .', '2018 , pillar place , local protest saw land encroach .', 'howev , sinc demarc agre upon high-rank govern offici nepal india , farmer ’ voic went unheard . “ tri stop border pillar place land .', 'administr side forcibl put without even tri hold discuss , ” said harish chandra yadav .', 'chief district offic dhanusha , chakrapani pandey , say border pillar place technic team measur agreement high-rank offici two countri . “ field hous built man ’ land recent clear .', 'one anyth particular area , ” said pandey .', '“ understand peopl ’ concern anyth . ”']"
Erroneous border pillar placement plagues Nepali farmers in Madhesh ,"Regenerative braking representational image. Photo: FreepikThe electric vehicle market in Nepal has grown significantly over the past year. Electric four-wheelers and two-wheelers are being launched almost every month, spanning from passenger to commercial vehicles. Electric transportation appears to be an emerging trend in the automotive industry.New EVs are regularly introduced with advanced features as car companies develop unique electric platforms. One standout feature is regenerative braking.Regenerative braking was first introduced in 1967 by the American Motor Car Company (AMC) in their prototype electric vehicle, the AMC Amitron. However, Toyota became the automobile manufacturer to implement regenerative braking system (RBS) technology in their Prius series hybrid vehicles in 1997. Toyota brought up the new hybrid technology in the Prius when fuel prices were going up at a massive rate. 1997 Toyota Prius Hybrid. Photo: ToyotaBut what is regenerative braking? There are still many people confused about what it is, whether it is safe or helpful in fuel economy in hybrid cars and the regeneration of electricity in electric cars.In simple terms, regen braking is when a car saves energy by recharging its battery when you brake, helping it use less fuel or electricity and go further. Easy but scientifically, regen braking is a process used in vehicles where the kinetic energy produced during braking is converted into electrical energy through an electric motor acting as a generator. This electrical energy is then stored in the vehicle’s battery for later use, reducing energy wastage and increasing overall efficiency.Photo: FreepikRegen braking can be seen in all kinds of EVs, including cars, scooters, commercial vans, buses, bicycles, three-wheelers, and rickshaws. It now can be electrically managed to what extent the power and braking can be generated. Regenerative Braking work process in EVPrinciple of Operation: Regene braking works by turning the energy from slowing down into electricity.Electric Motor as a Generator: In EV or hybrid cars with regen braking, the motor changes roles from moving the car to making electricity when you brake.Switching Polarity: When you brake, the motor switches directions, turning energy from the wheels into electricity instead of using it to move the car.Generation of Electricity: The turning wheels make the motor produce electricity, which goes to the car’s battery.Power Electronics: Special electronics change the electricity from the motor into the right kind for charging the battery.Battery Charging: The electricity made during braking charges up the car’s battery, storing the energy for later.Integration with Hydraulic Braking System: Regenerative braking works with the regular brakes, blending them for smooth stopping.Photo: automotive-iqAdvantages and Disadvantages of Regenerative Braking The advantages are listed below:Energy Efficiency: Regenerative braking efficiently captures the kinetic energy generated during braking, effectively reducing energy wastage and contributing to a more sustainable driving experience.Extended Range: By using the energy that would otherwise be lost during braking as heat and sound, regenerative braking helps to extend the driving range of electric vehicles in instances such as travelling downhill. Reduced Brake Wear: Regenerative braking minimizes the strain on traditional braking components, mitigating wear and tear, and potentially extending the lifespan of the braking components such as brake pads, rotors and brake lines, thus reducing maintenance costs over time.Enhanced Driving Experience: Regenerative braking provides a smoother braking experience and a more responsive feel to drivers, enhancing overall driving comfort and control on the road.The disadvantages are listed below:Limited Effectiveness at Low Speeds: While regenerative braking efficiently recaptures energy during braking, its effectiveness diminishes at lower speeds which leads to decreased energy recovery compared to higher speeds.Complexity and Cost: Implementing regenerative braking adds complexity and cost to vehicle systems, potentially raising manufacturing and maintenance expenses, and impacting consumer affordability.Maintenance Requirements: Regenerative braking systems require periodic maintenance and calibration to ensure they operate optimally.Efficiency Variability: Regenerative braking may exhibit variability in efficiency under extreme weather conditions or on certain road surfaces, leading to fluctuations in overall energy recapture and impacting the vehicle’s efficiency.MisconceptionsFully Recharges Battery: Some mistakenly believe that regenerative braking fully replenishes the battery, but in reality, it only adds a modest amount of charge.Increases Braking Distances: There is a misconception that regenerative braking extends braking distances, but it enhances braking performance by complementing traditional brakes.High-Speed Only: While more effective at higher speeds, regenerative braking still functions at lower speeds, such as during city driving or stop-and-go traffic.Maintenance-Free: Despite requiring less maintenance than traditional brakes, regen braking systems still need periodic checks and maintenance to ensure proper operation.Significantly Boosts Range: While regen braking contributes to extending the driving range of electric vehicles, its impact is influenced by various factors beyond just braking efficiency.Only for Electric Cars: Although commonly associated with electric vehicles, regen braking systems are also found in some conventional vehicles, particularly those aiming to improve fuel efficiency with advanced technology.Photo: FreepikRegenerative braking might sound complicated, but it is pretty cool. Think of it as a way for EVs and hybrids to recycle energy when they slow down. Instead of just wasting that energy, regenerative braking turns it into electricity, which can then be used to power the battery.",['erron border pillar placement plagu nepali farmer madhesh'],"['regen brake represent imag .', 'photo : freepikth electr vehicl market nepal grown significantli past year .', 'electr four-wheel two-wheel launch almost everi month , span passeng commerci vehicl .', 'electr transport appear emerg trend automot industry.new ev regularli introduc advanc featur car compani develop uniqu electr platform .', 'one standout featur regen braking.regen brake first introduc 1967 american motor car compani ( amc ) prototyp electr vehicl , amc amitron .', 'howev , toyota becam automobil manufactur implement regen brake system ( rb ) technolog priu seri hybrid vehicl 1997 .', 'toyota brought new hybrid technolog priu fuel price go massiv rate .', '1997 toyota priu hybrid .', 'photo : toyotabut regen brake ?', 'still mani peopl confus , whether safe help fuel economi hybrid car regener electr electr cars.in simpl term , regen brake car save energi recharg batteri brake , help use less fuel electr go .', 'easi scientif , regen brake process use vehicl kinet energi produc brake convert electr energi electr motor act gener .', 'electr energi store vehicl ’ batteri later use , reduc energi wastag increas overal efficiency.photo : freepikregen brake seen kind ev , includ car , scooter , commerci van , buse , bicycl , three-wheel , rickshaw .', 'electr manag extent power brake gener .', 'regen brake work process evprincipl oper : regen brake work turn energi slow electricity.electr motor gener : ev hybrid car regen brake , motor chang role move car make electr brake.switch polar : brake , motor switch direct , turn energi wheel electr instead use move car.gener electr : turn wheel make motor produc electr , goe car ’ battery.pow electron : special electron chang electr motor right kind charg battery.batteri charg : electr made brake charg car ’ batteri , store energi later.integr hydraul brake system : regen brake work regular brake , blend smooth stopping.photo : automotive-iqadvantag disadvantag regen brake advantag list : energi effici : regen brake effici captur kinet energi gener brake , effect reduc energi wastag contribut sustain drive experience.extend rang : use energi would otherwis lost brake heat sound , regen brake help extend drive rang electr vehicl instanc travel downhil .', 'reduc brake wear : regen brake minim strain tradit brake compon , mitig wear tear , potenti extend lifespan brake compon brake pad , rotor brake line , thu reduc mainten cost time.enhanc drive experi : regen brake provid smoother brake experi respons feel driver , enhanc overal drive comfort control road.th disadvantag list : limit effect low speed : regen brake effici recaptur energi brake , effect diminish lower speed lead decreas energi recoveri compar higher speeds.complex cost : implement regen brake add complex cost vehicl system , potenti rais manufactur mainten expens , impact consum affordability.mainten requir : regen brake system requir period mainten calibr ensur oper optimally.effici variabl : regen brake may exhibit variabl effici extrem weather condit certain road surfac , lead fluctuat overal energi recaptur impact vehicl ’ efficiency.misconceptions recharg batteri : mistakenli believ regen brake fulli replenish batteri , realiti , add modest amount charge.increas brake distanc : misconcept regen brake extend brake distanc , enhanc brake perform complement tradit brakes.high-spe : effect higher speed , regen brake still function lower speed , citi drive stop-and-go traffic.maintenance-fre : despit requir less mainten tradit brake , regen brake system still need period check mainten ensur proper operation.significantli boost rang : regen brake contribut extend drive rang electr vehicl , impact influenc variou factor beyond brake efficiency.onli electr car : although commonli associ electr vehicl , regen brake system also found convent vehicl , particularli aim improv fuel effici advanc technology.photo : freepikregen brake might sound complic , pretti cool .', 'think way ev hybrid recycl energi slow .', 'instead wast energi , regen brake turn electr , use power batteri .']"
"Regenerative Braking in EVs: Advantages, Disadvantages and Common Misconceptions ","The snow leopard rescued from Urlabari is currently being kept at the Central Zoo in Lalitpur. Photo: Aryan DhimalAs the gates to the vet clinic at the Central Zoo in Lalitpur opened, more than two dozen photojournalists thronged the facility and surrounded a metal cage aiming their DSLR cameras at a snow leopard inside.“Please don’t come close to the animal,” the zoo’s vet, Radha Krishna Gharti, told approaching photojournalists. But in the gush of excitement to take exclusive photographs of the elusive cat, difficult to spot even in its prime habitats, there were few takers for the word of caution.Nepal’s Department of National Parks and Wildlife Conservation (DNPWC) organised the photo-op two days after the male subadult cat, which was until recently found in the country only at altitudes higher than 2,000-6,000 metres above sea level, was brought to the zoo from Urlabari town(146 m above sea level). According to the department, the animal has sustained injuries to its right foreleg and cannot stand upright.Although officials involved said they are looking at releasing the animal into the wild after it recuperates, doing so will be a daunting task, adding that the zoo may be the only place where it can now survive.Not a wild catReporters and photojournalists take photos of a snow leopard being held at the Central Zoo in Lalitpur, Nepal. Image by Abhaya Raj Joshi/ Mongabay“Nepali snow leopard experts have come up with two hypotheses to explain how the animal from the mountains landed up in the plains,” said Sharad Chandra Adhikari, member-secretary at the National Trust for Nature Conservation (NTNC), a semi-government body that manages the zoo in Lalitpur, a town in the Kathmandu Valley. The first of the two hypotheses made public during the photo-op-cum-press conference, is that it was raised in captivity and somehow managed to escape into the wild. The second is that it lost its orientation while trying to establish its territory after separating from its mother.Kulbhushansingh Suryawanshi, director of the India program, Snow Leopard Trust, said that both hypotheses are plausible explanations as to how the snow leopard got to the plains in Nepal.A DNPWC official, who wished to remain anonymous as he is not authorised to talk to the press, said that it was more likely that the animal had been raised in captivity. “The way it sipped the water and ate the food zoo staff offered indicates that it may have been raised in captivity,” the official said.Snow leopards are shy cats living at extreme altitudes in the steep mountainous areas of 12 countries in Central and South Asia. Their global population spread over altitudes of 500-5,800 m, is estimated to be between around 3,900 and 6,000 as detailed coordinated surveys of the population in the range countries are yet to be carried out. In Nepal, their population divided into three blocks (eastern, central and western) is estimated to be between 301 and 400.Adhikari from NTNC said that researchers will now examine the animal’s scat to analyse its diet and try to find out whether it was roaming in the wild or had been in some sort of captivity. Researchers are also preparing to analyse its genes to try to find out to which of the three metapopulations in Nepal it belongs. They will also observe the animal’s canine teeth and fur to look for clues.Relocation challenge A snow leopard found in Urlabari town in Nepal’s plains in a cage at the Central Zoo in Kathmandu. Photo: Aryan DhimalThe whole process could take a few months to complete, and summer could set in in Kathmandu by then, officials concede. “The current temperature in Kathmandu is suitable for snow leopards, as we are in the peak of winter,” said Madhu Chetri, a snow leopard researcher from NTNC. But that could change as spring season begins in the Northern Hemisphere.The DNPWC official said that regardless of the findings related to how the animal got to Urlabarli, the animal would have spent a significant amount of time with humans during its recovery phase. “That would mean that it would have gotten habituated with having humans around,” the official said.Sending such animals back into the wild is a challenge, as they may have lost their hunting and other adaptation skills, he added. In May last year, officials at the Chitwan National Park released two rescued rhino calves into the wild, with limited success. The safety of the animals, which had gotten used to having humans around, was compromised as poachers could easily approach and kill them. Eventually, they were transferred to an enclosure in eastern Nepal away from human intervention.Veteran conservationist Professor Karan Bahadur Shah said that rewilding the snow leopard would be a daunting task, as the animals are territorial. “If we just leave the animal in its natural habitat, it will get killed by other snow leopards defending their territory,” he said. “The best option would be to keep the animal in the zoo for the public to see.”But Nepal’s Central Zoo has its own set of problems. The facility, established in 1932 as a private collection, has limited space and has frequently run into financial trouble. Conservationists say the snow leopard would need special facilities to cater to its needs.“If the government decides that the snow leopard needs to remain at the zoo, we are ready to shoulder the responsibility,” said Adhikari. “We have set up special facilities for animals such as the red panda and chimpanzees,” he said. “We can do that for the snow leopard as well.”Those advocating for keeping the animal in the zoo also said that Nepal is a snow leopard range country and the public, especially the young generation, also needs to see the different animals found in the country. “It has great educational value,” said Shah.Snow leopard expert Suryawanshi from neighbouring India also said that it would be challenging to release the animal into the wild. “If the team at the zoo can establish the exact cause of this behaviour [why it ventured into the plains] and can keep the animal away from human contact, then it might be okay to release it back,” he said. “But otherwise, there is little hope for it in the wild. Better to let it live in the zoo.”Back at the zoo, after the photojournalists are done taking photos, it is the turn of the reporters to point their smartphones at the animal. Then there is a contingent of senior wildlife department officials waiting in line to catch a glimpse of the animal. “So much for keeping it away from human contact,” a conservationist observing the hullabaloo from a distance said.This story first appeared on Mongabay and Onlinekhabar is republishing it under a Creative Commons licence.","['regen brake ev : advantag , disadvantag common misconcept']","['snow leopard rescu urlabari current kept central zoo lalitpur .', 'photo : aryan dhimala gate vet clinic central zoo lalitpur open , two dozen photojournalist throng facil surround metal cage aim dslr camera snow leopard insid . “ pleas ’ come close anim , ” zoo ’ vet , radha krishna gharti , told approach photojournalist .', 'gush excit take exclus photograph elus cat , difficult spot even prime habitat , taker word caution.nep ’ depart nation park wildlif conserv ( dnpwc ) organis photo-op two day male subadult cat , recent found countri altitud higher 2,000-6,000 metr sea level , brought zoo urlabari town ( 146 sea level ) .', 'accord depart , anim sustain injuri right foreleg stand upright.although offici involv said look releas anim wild recuper , daunt task , ad zoo may place survive.not wild catreport photojournalist take photo snow leopard held central zoo lalitpur , nepal .', 'imag abhaya raj joshi/ mongabay “ nepali snow leopard expert come two hypothes explain anim mountain land plain , ” said sharad chandra adhikari , member-secretari nation trust natur conserv ( ntnc ) , semi-govern bodi manag zoo lalitpur , town kathmandu valley .', 'first two hypothes made public photo-op-cum-press confer , rais captiv somehow manag escap wild .', 'second lost orient tri establish territori separ mother.kulbhushansingh suryawanshi , director india program , snow leopard trust , said hypothes plausibl explan snow leopard got plain nepal.a dnpwc offici , wish remain anonym authoris talk press , said like anim rais captiv .', '“ way sip water ate food zoo staff offer indic may rais captiv , ” offici said.snow leopard shi cat live extrem altitud steep mountain area 12 countri central south asia .', 'global popul spread altitud 500-5,800 , estim around 3,900 6,000 detail coordin survey popul rang countri yet carri .', 'nepal , popul divid three block ( eastern , central western ) estim 301 400.adhikari ntnc said research examin anim ’ scat analys diet tri find whether roam wild sort captiv .', 'research also prepar analys gene tri find three metapopul nepal belong .', 'also observ anim ’ canin teeth fur look clues.reloc challeng snow leopard found urlabari town nepal ’ plain cage central zoo kathmandu .', 'photo : aryan dhimalth whole process could take month complet , summer could set kathmandu , offici conced .', '“ current temperatur kathmandu suitabl snow leopard , peak winter , ” said madhu chetri , snow leopard research ntnc .', 'could chang spring season begin northern hemisphere.th dnpwc offici said regardless find relat anim got urlabarli , anim would spent signific amount time human recoveri phase .', '“ would mean would gotten habitu human around , ” offici said.send anim back wild challeng , may lost hunt adapt skill , ad .', 'may last year , offici chitwan nation park releas two rescu rhino calv wild , limit success .', 'safeti anim , gotten use human around , compromis poacher could easili approach kill .', 'eventu , transfer enclosur eastern nepal away human intervention.veteran conservationist professor karan bahadur shah said rewild snow leopard would daunt task , anim territori .', '“ leav anim natur habitat , get kill snow leopard defend territori , ” said .', '“ best option would keep anim zoo public see . ” nepal ’ central zoo set problem .', 'facil , establish 1932 privat collect , limit space frequent run financi troubl .', 'conservationist say snow leopard would need special facil cater need . “ govern decid snow leopard need remain zoo , readi shoulder respons , ” said adhikari .', '“ set special facil anim red panda chimpanze , ” said .', '“ snow leopard well . ” advoc keep anim zoo also said nepal snow leopard rang countri public , especi young gener , also need see differ anim found countri .', '“ great educ valu , ” said shah.snow leopard expert suryawanshi neighbour india also said would challeng releas anim wild .', '“ team zoo establish exact caus behaviour [ ventur plain ] keep anim away human contact , might okay releas back , ” said .', '“ otherwis , littl hope wild .', 'better let live zoo . ” back zoo , photojournalist done take photo , turn report point smartphon anim .', 'conting senior wildlif depart offici wait line catch glimps anim .', '“ much keep away human contact , ” conservationist observ hullabaloo distanc said.thi stori first appear mongabay onlinekhabar republish creativ common licenc .']"
Nepal’s ‘low-altitude’ snow leopard would face big hurdles in return to wild ,"The National Assembly was formed to give experienced people a chance to be part of the parliament and help during the formation of important bills. In countries that follow the Westminster model of government, the upper house plays an important role. That, however, is not the case in Nepal as the country’s upper house has become a platform where individuals secure positions in the National Assembly based on their connections. As the election nears, many once again question the relevance and existence of the upper house.Things were different in the past as the initial years of the National Assembly saw experienced politicians and experts others in their field be nominated for the post. That slowly changed as the first batch completed its two-year term.“I understand why people are frustrated with the upper house. People expected experts but all we got was party cadres who lacked knowledge or experience,” says Bimala Rai Paudyal a National Assembly member. “Considering such behaviour and practices, what distinguishes the House of Representatives from the National Assembly?”A loser’s second chance Narayan Kaji Shrestha, who faced defeat in the 2017 general election from Gorkha-2, was elected as a member of the National Assembly on January 23, 2020. Elected from Gandaki Province, Shrestha currently is the Deputy Prime Minister and Home Minister of the country.Bhagwati Neupane who lost the election from Gandaki province and Bimala Ghimire who lost the election for mayorship in Bhanu Municipality also shared the same trajectory.Similarly, Mrigendra Kumar Singh Yadav and Jag Prasad Sharma were defeated in the House of Representatives elections, from Saptari-4 and Dang-3 respectively are now members of the National Assembly. Bam Dev Gautam, who lost the elections from Bardiya, secured a place in the upper house through nomination by President Bidya Devi Bhandari.Even those who did not win as ward member(s) got the opportunity to become members of the National Assembly including Sindh Bahadur Bishwakarma who was appointed on February 7, 2018. He is soon leaving his post on March 3.Despite the repeated criticisms, the political parties have not paid attention to this concern posed by political leaders and the general public. The latest proof of this is the list of candidates for the National Assembly elections scheduled on January 25. The list contains names like Krishna Prasad Sitaula, defeated in the House of Representatives elections in 2022 from Koshi Province, and Pooja Chaudhary, who lost in the provincial assembly elections 2022 from Rautahat-3 (a).Speaker Ganesh Prasad Timilsina, who led the National Assembly for the entire six years under the federal system, is also dissatisfied with the individuals who have made it to the upper house. “The allegations are something for the parties to ponder upon. The leaders should have prioritised involving intellectuals/neutrals rather than managing its members,” he says.The 59-member National Assembly elects eight representatives, equally from all seven provinces, with an additional three individuals nominated by the President. The Constitution ensures representation of women, Dalits, minorities or disabled communities, envisioning that experts, experienced individuals, and the most qualified people from various fields will become members of the National Assembly.Easy way inFile: A National Assembly meetingThere are some reasons why leaders aspire to join the upper house, and even the leadership create opportunities for them. In National Assembly elections, voters consist of local-level heads/deputy heads and provincial assembly members. Typically, individuals seeking these positions undergo a vetting process by their respective parties. As a result, aspiring members of parliament can focus less on persuading individual voters and more on gaining party support to secure their candidacy. Moreover, being a member of the National Assembly opens avenues to ministerial roles. The constitution prohibits a National Assembly member from becoming the Prime Minister, but not Deputy Prime Minister. Due to such opportunities, leaders are enticed to seek a position in the assembly.The National Assembly is currently in its fourth election cycle since the promulgation of the Consitution in 2015. Scheduled for January 25, this election aims to fill 19 seats vacated by individuals completing their six-year terms. The previous election cycles took place in 2017, involving 56 members, followed by 2019 with 18 positions, and 2020 with 19 positions.The cascading impactsFile: A National Assembly meetingAnother reason why the National Assembly is finding it difficult to justify itself is that it has become a shadow of the House of Representatives. The meeting of the National Assembly did not have one session when the House of Representatives was dissolved by then Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli twice. The demands and issues raised by the opposition parties in the House of Representatives automatically went to the National Assembly, where the parliamentarians of the ruling party put forward any proposal, they endorse it the same as in the House of Representatives.The latest example – is the main opposition UML did not allow the meeting of the House of Representatives to continue for five days from July 5, 2023, due to a statement made by Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal during his visit to India. Consequently, the meeting of the National Assembly was also paused during that period.The UML obstructed the House of Representatives for almost a month starting mid-July last year demanding a high-level inquiry committee to probe the 60-kilogram gold smuggling case and the resignation of the Home Minister. The National Assembly followed suit with leaders pushing their agendas forward.Speaker Ganesh Timilsina himself is dissatisfied that every behaviour and activity of the House of Representatives influence the National Assembly. He says despite his attempts to prevent the overshadowing, it has been unfortunate that he did not garner the goodwill of the top leaders during political disputes.Reinstating powerThe National Assembly is a permanent institution. Therefore, it can remain operational even in the absence of the House of Representatives. Under normal circumstances, Speaker Timilsina initiated a positive practice by personally participating in different committees. Nevertheless, in the absence of the House of Representatives, the National Assembly often experienced inactivity.In December 2020, the Prime Minister at that time, KP Sharma Oli, dissolved the House of Representatives. Subsequently, a session of the National Assembly was convened on January 1, 2021. Despite lasting only seven hours over four days, this session, which took place after the dissolution, failed to address crucial public issues. Even after six months, important matters remained unaddressed within the House.On May 22, 2021, the UML-led government once again dissolved the House of Representatives. The meeting of the National Assembly and committees was affected once more. However, the dissolutions were declared unconstitutional by the Supreme Court, reinstating the parliament.The Constitution says that despite the closing of the National Assembly session, thematic committee meetings can still take place. However, both the National Assembly and its committees remained inactive until the restoration of the House of Representatives.According to Khimlal Devkota, a member of the National Assembly, when the House of Representatives was dissolved twice, it seemed that the National Assembly was also in a state of dissolution.Bimala Rai Paudyal also believes that the inability to resume the upper house is a mark of weakness. “Since the government was not in a position to call, the President needed to be consulted by the chair together with the consultation committee. That was not done either,” she says.Constitutional and legal distinctionsExcept for the Constitution of Nepal (1962) and the Interim Constitution of Nepal (2007), all other constitutions in Nepal provided for a bicameral parliament with the National Assembly or the Upper House and the House of Representatives or the Lower House. The practices before 2015 were under the unitary governance system, but after the adoption of the federal democratic republican governance system, the role of the National Assembly has changed somewhat.In the preamble of the constitution prepared by the ‘Constituent Assembly, and Administrative Organ Designation Committee’ during the drafting of the constitution, it is mentioned that some different qualifications have been prescribed for being a member of the House of Representatives and the National Assembly, with the intention that qualified people can be represented in the National Assembly.Chair of the National Assembly Ganesh Prasad Timilsina restates that the members of the upper house should be assessed based on the country’s expectations with clear criteria. There is no definite definition of an expert in the constitution. It has been stated symbolically, “…It is expected that the members should have some basic skills to face the challenges and fulfil their responsibilities.”According to the constitution, the responsibility of the National Assembly is to correctly establish the rights of the local level, state, and union, and to prevent the House of Representatives from trying to enact laws contrary to the spirit of federalism. There is an explanatory comment in the constitution about the propriety of the National Assembly – “This House is expected to fulfil its role to maintain creative and mutual relations between the national government and the provinces.”In addition, there are some constitutional and legal differences regarding the National Assembly. But the MPs are demanding that it should cease. When a bill originating in the House of Representatives is passed and sent to the National Assembly, and if the latter does not decide within 60 days, it proceeds de facto.This has placed the National Assembly in a dilemma. The Chairman of the National Assembly, Timilsina, says, “Such an arrangement should also apply to the House of Representatives, or both should be equal.”Need for course correction PM Pushpa Kamal Dahal speaking in the National Assembly meeting.Some instances have turned these so-called experts into a laughing stock due to their actions. On July 5, 2023,  a discussion on the Electronic Commerce (E-Commerce) Bill 2023 was tabled in the National Assembly. However, the parliamentarians misunderstood the main point and instead discussed the matter of electricity. The MPs, who had not read the proposal, suggested that electricity consumption within Nepal should also be increased besides exporting electricity to India and Bangladesh.During the meeting, Ramesh Rijal, the Minister of Industry, Commerce and Supplies, also mentioned that India would purchase electricity during the Prime Minister’s visit. Unfortunately, the bill was unanimously approved.Timilsina considers the incident an example, that in his six-year tenure, he does not want to remember. Som Bahadur Thapa, a former secretary at the Parliament Secretariat, termed the incident ‘a joke’ in the Parliament of Nepal. “This is strong proof of the kind of MPs we have, who speak without knowing what they are talking about.” Timilsina assumed the role of the speaker/chair of the National Assembly after the establishment of the Federal Democratic Republic. He had the opportunity to establish the system and the dignity of the National Assembly. However, instead of setting a positive example, he will soon be retiring after being accused of playing tricks with the Speaker and showing interest in the work of the House of Representatives.Timilsina has repeatedly commented on the affairs of the House of Representatives. The latest instance was during a seminar on ‘Japan: Past, Present, and Future’ held in the capital on December 2, 2023, he publicly stated that the election results of the House of Representatives did not bode well.Pointing to the emergence of a new party and the victory of some independent candidates, he said, “In a democracy, you get to choose candidates, irrespective of their party affiliation. However, is the signal positive?”In August/ September 2022, Timilsina wrote a letter to the Election Commission, urging them to extend the tenure of Speaker and Deputy Speaker. Upon receiving a response stating that the Commission would not determine the tenure of the elected Parliament, Timilsina directed the Parliament Secretariat not to execute decisions made by the Management Committee after September 17, 2022.This created conflict between the Speaker of the House of Representatives and the Speaker of the National Assembly and in the crux of this dispute between the parties, the country had to bear the consequences of this conflict. Laws could not be enacted promptly, and the place once considered the domain of experts was overshadowed by the party’s interest. A study conducted by the Democracy Resource Center Nepal (DRCN) on the legislative functioning of the National Assembly has revealed that the Upper House has passed some bills that go against the spirit of federalism.The report’s concluding remarks say, “…the bills passed by the House of Representatives have not undergone significant changes or discussions in the National Assembly. The conclusion section of the study states that – “Furthermore, some bills, contradicting the spirit of federalism and addressing the interests of interest groups, have been approved by the National Assembly.”Overall, in the last six years, parties have introduced individuals who, given their presentation level, have raised questions about the National Assembly’s justification. If there are no changes in the constitution, laws, and policies concerning the upper assembly, these concerns will persist.”",['nepal ’ ‘ low-altitud ’ snow leopard would face big hurdl return

"6 years on, the National Assembly has struggled to show its worth ","Representational image Photo by Tanushree Rao on UnsplashWhile most of the nation was preparing for the festival of lights, Tihar in early November 2023, something no less exciting was fuelling our sparks from oceans away. A queer art festival was happening for the seventeenth year and we had a chance to attend it as delegates. Our delegation was made possible through the collaboration between the Outburst Arts, an art organisation based in Northern Ireland, UK and the British Council, Nepal.There is a clear distinction between cities in terms of their flourishing arts scenes, and this became apparent during a visit to Belfast, Northern Ireland, specifically for the Outburst Queer Arts Festival held in the charming city centre. The organisation of such a festival requires months of careful preparation and planning.The queer art festival started as short events lasting a few days. Now, after 17 years, it has grown into a ten-day festival with panel discussions, theatre performances, and exhibitions. Program guides were available at venues, partner hotels, local libraries, and shops. Many delegates, including us, came from outside Northern Ireland to attend.During the queer art festival, we had the opportunity to connect with art curators, publishers, artists, and representatives from other British Council departments around the world (Lithuania, France, South Africa, Turkey, Greece, Jordan, England, and Argentina to name a few.) Each event that we attended gave us a different insight into what the arts can do and how it can facilitate connections. We gained insights from queer publishers and art curators on the challenges they face in their own countries due to resources and sometimes from bureaucracy in systems. We also got to see the way people can thrive when given a platform to showcase their works, such as an art exhibition in which the artist reimagined intimacy for queer people.On the other hand, Nepal struggles by and large at times for queer visibility. There are no explicit spaces for SOGIESC (Sexual Orientation, Gender Identity and Expressions and Sex Characteristics) artists to showcase their works nor openly come together as a community, it all exists in pocket spaces. In the same way, something that struck us was the presence of older queer artists at the festival. It was not just for one particular event during the queer art festival. We noticed an active participation and involvement of older queer people throughout the festival there. It was fascinating to see queer artists in their 40s and 50s share their transformative and inspiring work. Whereas, back home, the queer folks at the forefront of queer art, advocacy and activism are mostly Gen-Zs and millennials. We have very few queer elders that we can count on our fingers who are diligently working for Nepali queer folks. Even among them, some still hold onto archaic notions and refuse to evolve and embrace changes. So, there’s that.From dream to realityDuring the queer art festival, we had the opportunity to connect with art curators, publishers and artists. Photo by Raphael Renter | @raphi_rawr on UnsplashBefore being selected as delegates, both of us joined online meetings with British Council Nepal and the Outburst representatives facilitated through Kaalo 101 (an art space in Patan), along with interested queer artists from Nepal. We had a total of three meetings where we discussed the possibilities and challenges of doing a queer art festival in Nepal. The discourse also entailed us sharing a presentation about the updates of the queer art scene in Nepal in the last five years. The updates included memorable leaps taken in queer arts from music to literature and fashion and more by artists from diverse walks of life. Days after the third meeting, the British Council extended invitations to us to attend the Outburst Queer Arts Festival.Our delegation is just one example of the transcontinental collaboration because it was something that happened for the first time and involved us. But, Outburst Arts and the British Council have been practising cross-continental collaboration for years. Even in this year’s festival, we witnessed a lot of artists from different continents work together in exhibitions, lectures, panel discussions, magazines and so on. The amalgamation introduced us to brilliant thought-provoking work that defies gender and sociopolitical norms. The power of transcontinental collaboration was beyond beautiful.Imagining queer arts in NepalPhoto by Nikolas Gannon on UnsplashThe queer art scene in Nepal is an emerging one. While a full-fledged festival may not be possible now, something small yet significant is achievable. Time and again, different organisations have been running large art exhibitions/tours for weeks and months. However, in the microcosm that is Nepal, especially Kathmandu, the capital is no stranger to art-oriented programs. What it has been unfamiliar with precisely is queer art. And the unfamiliarity is not something induced by the lack of queer artists and their art. Sadly, it is because of inadequate platforms, space and resources to pursue queer arts.Despite this, through the years there have been events and literature that have emerged centring on queer identity, but it has not come without its challenges. On collections of stories, “Pride Climbing Higher” and “Songs of Revolution” showcase stories from Nepalis across Nepal. There are not many stories reflecting the Nepali queer experiences otherwise. June Pride Parade by Queer Youth Group has gained momentum as well in the past few years since its conception, from a small gathering to now a large parade with performances from community members. The same can be said about Blue Diamond Society’s (BDS) Rainbow Visibility Pride events in August during the festival of Saa-Paru (Gai Jatra) which has been running for well over a decade; in recent years they have included flash mobs and interaction programmes as well in lead up to their parade. Individuals within the community have also organised their queer gatherings with friends, thus coming back to the cosmos of pocket spaces in celebrating queerness.While artists like us are creative with what we want to put out, we still need organisations like the British Council to foster spaces and connections to enable us to do that. Then and again, artists have come together and collaborated on queer-centric projects. But, we need funding and resources to achieve bigger-scale projects that unite more artists and transcend borders.Both of us advocate for queer rights and are involved in programs and activities that push the narrative further, extend the visibility of the community and normalise conversations surrounding queerness. Among other things, we are also the founders of Queering The Bond, a networking collective for Nepali queer folks and Shuby is also the founder of Queer Honky-Tonk, a platform to promote queer performances and networking with events such as a drag show or open mic every few months. However, both of us, individually or collaboratively can only do so much. The challenges of living in a capitalistic world oftentimes outweigh the passion we have for the queer art scene in Nepal. And this is where we expect the government and organisations to step up with policies, platforms and programs to provide spaces, opportunities and resources for queer artists. Here, the British Council joined hands with Outburst Arts, which paved the way for our delegation. We would not have known about the marvellous queer art festival at the other end of the world otherwise.Besides the limitations brought by insufficient spaces and social unawareness, the centralised capital does hinder queer artists from outside the city to connect, create and collaborate. Art already is centralised and elitist. On top of that, the concentrated Kathmandu Valley is of no help when it comes to making art accessible beyond its borders.Furthermore, there is also the expectation from basically everyone to have the perfect festival that caters to all people’s needs and wants. While the festival, if it should happen, is bound to be done with the right intentions, there is a lot of pressure for the first-time event itself. The festival will be inclusive and diverse. But, realistically speaking, it would be a struggle to make it relevant to each queer person from east to west.Speaking of struggles, a visceral feeling of uneasiness swarmed over me with each step I took while exiting the airport after the flight back home. I, Birat, personally felt that I could not be as free or unrestrained in Nepal as I was during my time in Belfast. No wonder a lot of the queer people we know opt for abroad.Seventeen years ago, when the Outburst Queer Arts Festival first began, it certainly was not as celebrated or large as it is now. What we are trying to convey here is that we do not have to start big. We can aim for something small yet promising. While there might be expectations to check all the boxes, it is crucial to be mindful of our capacity as well. But, we can be capacitated and this is where you – people in power, art enthusiasts, grant and resource allocators and media come in. It is time we all believe in Nepali queer art and create space for it to not only survive but thrive. It is imperative to understand that formulating our imagination into reality can only be possible through unwavering collaboration.","['6 year , nation assembl struggl show worth']","['represent imag photo tanushre rao unsplashwhil nation prepar festiv light , tihar earli novemb 2023 , someth less excit fuell spark ocean away .', 'queer art festiv happen seventeenth year chanc attend deleg .', 'deleg made possibl collabor outburst art , art organis base northern ireland , uk british council , nepal.ther clear distinct citi term flourish art scene , becam appar visit belfast , northern ireland , specif outburst queer art festiv held charm citi centr .', 'organis festiv requir month care prepar planning.th queer art festiv start short event last day .', ', 17 year , grown ten-day festiv panel discuss , theatr perform , exhibit .', 'program guid avail venu , partner hotel , local librari , shop .', 'mani deleg , includ us , came outsid northern ireland attend.dur queer art festiv , opportun connect art curat , publish , artist , repres british council depart around world ( lithuania , franc , south africa , turkey , greec , jordan , england , argentina name . )', 'event attend gave us differ insight art facilit connect .', 'gain insight queer publish art curat challeng face countri due resourc sometim bureaucraci system .', 'also got see way peopl thrive given platform showcas work , art exhibit artist reimagin intimaci queer people.on hand , nepal struggl larg time queer visibl .', 'explicit space sogiesc ( sexual orient , gender ident express sex characterist ) artist showcas work openli come togeth commun , exist pocket space .', 'way , someth struck us presenc older queer artist festiv .', 'one particular event queer art festiv .', 'notic activ particip involv older queer peopl throughout festiv .', 'fascin see queer artist 40 50 share transform inspir work .', 'wherea , back home , queer folk forefront queer art , advocaci activ mostli gen-z millenni .', 'queer elder count finger dilig work nepali queer folk .', 'even among , still hold onto archaic notion refus evolv embrac chang .', ', ’ that.from dream realitydur queer art festiv , opportun connect art curat , publish artist .', 'photo raphael renter | @ raphi_rawr unsplashbefor select deleg , us join onlin meet british council nepal outburst repres facilit kaalo 101 ( art space patan ) , along interest queer artist nepal .', 'total three meet discuss possibl challeng queer art festiv nepal .', 'discours also entail us share present updat queer art scene nepal last five year .', 'updat includ memor leap taken queer art music literatur fashion artist divers walk life .', 'day third meet , british council extend invit us attend outburst queer art festival.our deleg one exampl transcontinent collabor someth happen first time involv us .', ', outburst art british council practis cross-continent collabor year .', 'even year ’ festiv , wit lot artist differ contin work togeth exhibit , lectur , panel discuss , magazin .', 'amalgam introduc us brilliant thought-provok work defi gender sociopolit norm .', 'power transcontinent collabor beyond beautiful.imagin queer art nepalphoto nikola gannon unsplashth queer art scene nepal emerg one .', 'full-fledg festiv may possibl , someth small yet signific achiev .', 'time , differ organis run larg art exhibitions/tour week month .', 'howev , microcosm nepal , especi kathmandu , capit stranger art-ori program .', 'unfamiliar precis queer art .', 'unfamiliar someth induc lack queer artist art .', 'sadli , inadequ platform , space resourc pursu queer arts.despit , year event literatur emerg centr queer ident , come without challeng .', 'collect stori , “ pride climb higher ” “ song revolut ” showcas stori nepali across nepal .', 'mani stori reflect nepali queer experi otherwis .', 'june pride parad queer youth group gain momentum well past year sinc concept , small gather larg parad perform commun member .', 'said blue diamond societi ’ ( bd ) rainbow visibl pride event august festiv saa-paru ( gai jatra ) run well decad ;

Queer art festival: Reflecting and imagining the power of collaboration in Nepal ,"The month of January saw major road accidents in different parts of the country, including Lamhi in Dang, Dhorpatan in Baglung, and Chandragiri in Kathmandu. Road accidents have been common throughout the country with Nepal Police data suggesting over 2,500 people dying in them annually. Despite this, the Ministry of Finance has shown reluctance to introduce the proposed Road Safety Bill to reduce traffic accidents, fatalities, and serious injuries, and enhance road safety. Instead, the Finance Ministry has asked the Ministry of Physical Infrastructure and Transport to include the proposed bill in the Public Roads Act. Along with that, the government’s initiative to pass dedicated laws on road safety and set up a mechanism, including the empowered National Road Safety Council (NRSC), to decrease accidents, has come to a halt.Keshav Kumar Sharma, secretary of the Ministry of Physical Infrastructure and Transport, says they asked for a dedicated road safety law that comprehensively addresses institutional arrangements was the need of the hour. This includes ensuring safety in road construction, promoting public awareness, providing training and communication facilities, implementing rescue mechanisms, and arranging rehabilitation for families affected by road accidents. However, the Ministry of Finance believes a separate law is unnecessary due to concerns about potential increased financial burden.Hourly needOfficials from the Ministry of Physical Infrastructure allege that the Ministry of Finance is approaching sensitive matters, such as passenger safety, solely from an economic standpoint. They say that concerns related to road, vehicle, and passenger safety are being overshadowed, and there are indications that this approach will continue. “The government is avoiding addressing the sensitive issue of road accidents and the associated human and material costs, fearing an increase in expenses. This contradicts the government’s commitment and policy to reduce traffic accidents in the future,” says an official from the Ministry of Physical Infrastructure on the condition of anonymity.According to the Ministry of Physical Infrastructure, the existing laws lack the vision and purpose necessary for developing a sustainable, safe, risk-free, and reliable transportation operation and security system. Therefore, the Ministry of Physical Infrastructure officials argue that a distinct law is essential to decrease road accidents and ensure the safety of pedestrians, including passenger transport workers and roadside residents, as well as pets, wild animals, and birds. “The Road Safety Act is the need of the hour as it will help us during post-accident rescue, treatment management, rehabilitation, and legal representation,” says the official.Currently, there are gaps in enforcing road rules, monitoring vehicle capacities, ensuring road structure safety, managing traffic signs, and organizing road safety facilities. The implementation of the Road Safety Act is seen as crucial to address these issues.However, there has not been a facilitative environment for providing education and raising awareness about road traffic safety, safety mechanisms, and coordinating among organisations related to road transport. The aspect of training drivers with skills and knowledge, as well as monitoring road safety on the roads, is also lacking. This is why experts have been suggesting introducing a separate road safety law to address these aspects.The Finance Ministry, however, says that road safety should not be downplayed by ignoring human sensibilities related to road safety and citing economic reasons. Officials from the Ministry of Physical Infrastructure argue that incorporating safety considerations in the Road Act does not automatically result in a decrease in accidents or the integration of post-accident rescue, relief, and rehabilitation efforts.“The existing laws do not address road safety anywhere. Due to its lack of clarity and inadequacy, it has not been implemented with due diligence. For instance, provisions such as those for vehicle inspectors outlined in the Transport Act have not been acted upon by the government,” says an official from the Transport Ministry.Policies and commitments, but no lawsThe Motor Vehicles and Transport Management Act (1993) includes several provisions related to vehicle registration, road permits, driver’s licenses, traffic management, insurance, and penalties. The Public Roads Act (1974) primarily focuses on road management. However, there is no provision in the Act regarding the National Road Safety Council.In this situation, Nepal has developed a 10-year road safety action plan but is yet to enact corresponding legislation. Unfortunately, government agencies and mechanisms are not obligated to follow the action plan, as it lacks legal guidance.Now, the Transport Ministry holds the view that if safety considerations are explicitly addressed in the Public Roads Act, the outcome will not differ from what the Finance Ministry has said. Given the Public Roads Act’s close association with the Department of Road, the ministry thinks greater emphasis will be placed on road construction. However, they argue that incorporating the road safety aspect into the Act would not be effective.Secretary Sharma of the Transport Ministry is tasked with ensuring road safety, overseeing physical infrastructure and transport, and coordinating efforts across education, health, home, law, federal affairs, and general administration ministries. This responsibility extends to provincial ministries, local levels, as well as various agencies, organisations, security agencies, non-governmental organisations, and related entities, each with their specific roles.“As all the agencies need to be allocated responsibilities for various aspects of road safety, we have requested them to collaborate in formulating a distinct law. This should encompass the reduction of all types of accidents,” said Sharma.The ministry believes that a dedicated law addressing road safety is crucial to mitigate severe road accidents in Nepal and to uphold the commitments made by the country on the international stage.Nepal has committed to implementing the Stockholm Declaration through the Global Road Traffic Safety Conference in 2020, as per the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. Nepal, which has incorporated sustainable development goals into its national development plan, has not yet commenced work aligned with these objectives.Nevertheless, Nepal’s neighbouring countries are already addressing road safety through legal frameworks. Various states in India have enacted road safety laws, and the effectiveness of these laws is contributing to a 50 per cent reduction in road accidents.In 1999, Bhutan also introduced a unified road safety and transport act. Pakistan, on the other hand, issued the National Highway Safety Ordinance-2000 to ensure road safety, distinct from its National Highway Authority Act (1991). Britain, Australia, America, New Zealand, and other countries have established separate road safety laws as well.Road safety neglectedIn Nepal, road safety has been consistently neglected due to the absence of dedicated legislation. Road safety expert Keshav Adhikari says that the government primarily focused on road construction, overlooks crucial aspects such as road safety and reinforcement. Consequently, roads are transforming into perilous pathways for both vehicles and passengers.“There is a lack of interest in formulating policies and laws aimed at mitigating financial losses resulting from accidents,” says Adhikari.He further points out that safety is not a governmental priority, as expanding the road network is perceived to yield more political benefits than implementing additional structures to enhance road safety.“When I worked as an expert in the Transport Ministry for over a year, I realised that promoting road safety is not a government priority,” he says. “Annually, more people die due to road accidents than those who die in natural disasters, but the government has not given it much attention.”Even though the prime minister, ministers, and MPs keep asserting that roads have been constructed, no one seems to be addressing the critical issues of road safety and quality.Saroj Sitaula, General Secretary of the Federation of Nepalese National Transport Entrepreneurs (FNNTE), says that the government must be attentive as accidents are on the rise due to various technical and human factors, including road infrastructure. “Many accidents can be mitigated by improving road conditions, installing barriers on the sides, putting up informational boards, and ensuring scientific and practical road markings,” he says. “We need to formulate a plan and progress accordingly.”Sitaula argues that the government should establish policies to create mechanisms for emergency rescue, treatment, and rehabilitation after an accident occurs. He emphasises the importance of enhancing road infrastructure, conducting a scientific examination of the technical condition of vehicles, and ensuring compliance with the law by drivers, passengers, and regulators. He says that blaming drivers and transport entrepreneurs for accidents is inadequate, and the government must fulfil its responsibilities.Roads are unsafeNepal currently boasts a road network spanning approximately 100,000 km, with the majority consisting of dirt and gravel roads. Among the more than 22,000 kilometres of national and subsidiary highways, numerous sections remain unpaved.Despite the government’s substantial investment in road construction and expansion, minimal efforts are allocated to ensuring road safety. Recently, all three levels of government have accelerated the widening of roads, incorporating asphalt and slopes. However, it appears that issues concerning road quality and safety are escalating at a faster pace. Roads that have been neglected in the guise of maintenance have become a nightmare for the public.Infrastructure expert Suryaraj Acharya notes that these problems arise due to the tendency to construct roads only after they have sustained damage, without considering potential issues during the initial construction phase.",['queer art festiv : reflect imagin power collabor nepal'],"['month

The design is fascinating. Realme patterned up with Luxury Swiss Watch designer Ollivier Savéo to craftfully design the smartphone. All the colour options have a vegan leather back. Since the phone is designed by a luxury watch designer, it comes with a big round camera module housing the triple camera setup. There is a golden 3D Jubilee Bracelet which gives the texture of a luxury watch strap. A golden patterned line runs through the middle and around the camera module for an even better look.Realme 12 Pro+ 5G designer Ollivier Savéo.

Realme 12 Pro+ 5G: Is it the best designed phone for 2024? ,"Ram Bujhaun Yadav with his land ownership certificate stands near a border pillar which he says was erroneously placed on his land. In October 2023, when 51-year-old Ram Bujhaun Yadav of Musaharnia Rural Municipality-5, Mukhiyapatti, Dhanusha, was at a relative’s house, someone told him that two Indian Sashastra Seema Bal (SSB) personnel were looking for him.Anxious, he rushed home wondering why they were looking for him.“They asked me if the paddy field in the no man’s land was mine. I told them yes and they asked me to cut down the paddy immediately,” he said.The paddy was not ripe and Yadav asked them for some time. However, the SSB personnel told him he had to cut down his paddy immediately.Ram Bujhaun and his wife Tetari Devi each own a 677-square-metre plot of land. As Nepal and India reevaluated the border, Ram Bujhan’s land was been deemed to be near the no man’s land as it now has two demarcation pillars.Frustrated, Ram Bujhaun cut the paddy before it was due to be harvested. Now, he has been asked to not plant anything on the land as it falls in the no man’s land.“Our border police don’t say a word. I can’t fight the SSB on my own,” says Ram Bujhaun adding he had decided not to plan anything on the land anymore.Woes of the farmersMany farmers in southern Nepal say their land has now been placed in India after the recent demarcation. When the Jamuna River, which flows through the no man’s land between Nepal and India, changed its course some two decades ago, some border pillars went missing. Locals say these pillars have now been placed encroaching on Nepali land.In 2018, with the then Chief District Officer of Dhanusha, Pradeep Raj Kandel, and an official from Madhubani district, Bihar, India, a team that included border security forces from both countries, the Armed Police Force of Nepal, and SSB of India began placing border pillars after land measurement by technicians.Locals have raised concerns, stating that border pillars have been positioned, encroaching approximately 50 to 100 meters of land into Nepal compared to the previous position. Many like Ram Bujhaun are unaware of when these border pillars were placed.“I did not know that pillar was placed here. After I found out when I asked the village leaders, many said they were placing the border pillars as they pleased,” said Ram Bujhaun.He was told to carry on planting paddy and that it would not matter as these issues had happened in the past. “They encroached on my land and have asked me not to plant anything. This is gross injustice,” he says.Ram Bujhaun’s family owns a total of 4,000 square metres of land, with 2,000 square metres belonging to him and the remaining 2,000 square metres to his brother Bechan. However, 1,000 square metres of his land is now located on the Indian side after the demarcation. Despite this, he has been farming on the land and continues to pay taxes to the Department of Land Management and Archive in Nepal.“They have marked my land to be on the Indian side and placed border pillars on it. I’ve been farming till now but I don’t know when they will ask me to stop,” he says.Ignorance of the governmentThe Madhesh province in southern NepalThe former ward chair of Mukhiyapatti Musharniya Rural Municipality-5, Ram Naresh Yadav, said that over time, India has encroached on numerous Nepali lands in various locations in the Madhesh Province. This, he says, happened due to the Nepali administration’s ignorance and weak stature.“They (Nepali administration) were careless and that meant the Indian side placed these border pillars by encroaching on Nepali land,” says Ram Naresh.He said that over 40 farmers from wards 1, 5, and 6 have land ranging from 300 to 1,600 square metres on the Indian side. “These farmers have land ownership certificates, but they cannot farm as the SSB says the land is in India and not Nepal,” said Ram Naresh.In 1996, land ownership certificates were distributed after surveying the land in the border area. Local Dharmendra Kumar Yadav said that since then, the locals have been paying their land tax regularly. In 2018, when the pillar was being placed, the locals protested when they saw their land was being encroached on. However, since the demarcation had been agreed upon by high-ranking government officials of Nepal and India, the farmer’s voices went unheard.“We tried to stop when the border pillars were being placed on our land. But the administrators from both sides forcibly put it there without even trying to hold a discussion,” said Harish Chandra Yadav. The Chief District Officer of Dhanusha, Chakrapani Pandey, says that the border pillars were placed by the technical team after the measurements and with the agreement of the high-ranking officials of the two countries.“The fields and houses that are built in no man’s land have recently been cleared. No one can do anything in this particular area,” said Pandey. “We understand the people’s concern but we cannot do anything about it now.”",['realm 12 pro+ 5g : best design phone 2024 ?'],"['ram bujhaun yadav land ownership certif stand near border pillar say erron place land .', 'octob 2023 , 51-year-old ram bujhaun yadav musaharnia rural municipality-5 , mukhiyapatti , dhanusha , rel ’ hous , someon told two indian sashastra seema bal ( ssb ) personnel look him.anxi , rush home wonder look him . “ ask paddi field man ’ land mine .', 'told ye ask cut paddi immedi , ” said.th paddi ripe yadav ask time .', 'howev , ssb personnel told cut paddi immediately.ram bujhaun wife tetari devi 677-square-metr plot land .', 'nepal india reevalu border , ram bujhan ’ land deem near man ’ land two demarc pillars.frustr , ram bujhaun cut paddi due harvest .', ', ask plant anyth land fall man ’ land . “ border polic ’ say word .', '’ fight ssb , ” say ram bujhaun ad decid plan anyth land anymore.wo farmersmani farmer southern nepal say land place india recent demarc .', 'jamuna river , flow man ’ land nepal india , chang cours two decad ago , border pillar went miss .', 'local say pillar place encroach nepali land.in 2018 , chief district offic dhanusha , pradeep raj kandel , offici madhubani district , bihar , india , team includ border secur forc countri , arm polic forc nepal , ssb india began place border pillar land measur technicians.loc rais concern , state border pillar posit , encroach approxim 50 100 meter land nepal compar previou posit .', 'mani like ram bujhaun unawar border pillar place . “ know pillar place .', 'found ask villag leader , mani said place border pillar pleas , ” said ram bujhaun.h told carri plant paddi would matter issu happen past .', '“ encroach land ask plant anyth .', 'gross injustic , ” says.ram bujhaun ’ famili own total 4,000 squar metr land , 2,000 squar metr belong remain 2,000 squar metr brother bechan .', 'howev , 1,000 squar metr land locat indian side demarc .', 'despit , farm land continu pay tax depart land manag archiv nepal . “ mark land indian side place border pillar .', '’ farm till ’ know ask stop , ” says.ignor governmentth madhesh provinc southern nepalth former ward chair mukhiyapatti musharniya rural municipality-5 , ram naresh yadav , said time , india encroach numer nepali land variou locat madhesh provinc .', ', say , happen due nepali administr ’ ignor weak statur . “ ( nepali administr ) careless meant indian side place border pillar encroach nepali land , ” say ram naresh.h said 40 farmer ward 1 , 5 , 6 land rang 300 1,600 squar metr indian side .', '“ farmer land ownership certif , farm ssb say land india nepal , ” said ram naresh.in 1996 , land ownership certif distribut survey land border area .', 'local dharmendra kumar yadav said sinc , local pay land tax regularli .', '2018 , pillar place , local protest saw land encroach .', 'howev , sinc demarc agre upon high-rank govern offici nepal india , farmer ’ voic went unheard . “ tri stop border pillar place land .', 'administr side forcibl put without even tri hold discuss , ” said harish chandra yadav .', 'chief district offic dhanusha , chakrapani pandey , say border pillar place technic team measur agreement high-rank offici two countri . “ field hous built man ’ land recent clear .', 'one anyth particular area , ” said pandey .', '“ understand peopl ’ concern anyth . ”']"
Erroneous border pillar placement plagues Nepali farmers in Madhesh ,"Photo by pippen on UnsplashLife is filled with surprises and unexpected events and it can change at any moment. The only thing certain in life is the uncertainty. Change is a natural and inevitable part of our lives, and it may be positive as well as negative.Even though it is not guaranteed that we will wake up in the morning, we set the alarm every night with the hope that we will wake up in the morning. We do not know what each day is going to bring us, but we may have varieties, adventures, and endless opportunities.The push to exploreThe uncertainty sometimes forces us to explore those aspects of life, we never knew existed or needed. It also tests the mental strength of people and how they deal with it. The uncertainty has taught me to be grateful, as we never know what life throws at us.In life, everything does not go according to our plans, and if we do not embrace the change we will face huge trouble. The Covid-19 pandemic is the best example of uncertainty, we were constantly fearing death and it was uncertain that we would see the sunrise the next day.It is not certain that every decision in life will be correct, but if you fear not trying at all, you miss endless opportunities for learning and growing. When our decisions or outcomes are on the negative side, we get depressed and we might tend to think about committing suicide, but we forget that if we have life we have endless opportunities. Most of us plan for our careers, our love life, etc. and when those plans do not work out we start getting uncomfortable. But if we can deal with today, we can surely deal with tomorrow. We need to cherish little moments in our lives and know that nothing is permanent not even the failures and setbacks.We come here with nothing and leave with nothing. So why should we hold the egos and grudges against each other? Instead of making our life meaningful and enjoying the journey of life, we get into puzzles of accumulating wealth and we go against our own loved ones for it. Change is certainPhoto by Kathyryn Tripp on UnsplashNothing is permanent in life, everything can change in fractions of seconds. In today’s society, everyone is so busy, that we people have so less time for our loved ones. What I have learned over the years, is to find time in our busy schedule for our family because we never know when it will be our last day together with them. Yes! Death is a natural process, so if you have to die someday, why should you die with grudges in your heart? But instead of worrying about the inevitable, focusing on the things you can control will bring a lot of happiness in life.Uncertainty is not only a negative thing; it also brings a lot of opportunity because you dare to change. The life-changing experience will not come knocking down your door, you need to expose yourself. We learn by doing and experimenting, even though we might fail. But that is not the end of the world. I still remember hesitating while applying for the role of leadership, at my school level as it was not certain that I would be chosen.Even after being selected, I was uncertain about whether I could fulfil my responsibilities or not. But that uncertainty helped me grow out of my comfort zone and give my best input. If I had not applied for that role just because I was uncertain of the outcome, I would miss the biggest learning opportunity in my school life. So, do not let the uncertainty or the unknown ever stop you from trying and no matter how much we try, to plan life always finds a way to surprise us. It is important to stay grounded when we have everything we wish for because life can take such a turn that we had never expected in our wildest dreams. Similarly, nothing is permanent in life, the financial hardships, the grades, the breakups, etc. But the most important thing is not to lose hope during those difficult times.According to the data provided by Nepal police, around 6,830 people took their lives in the fiscal year 2022/23. There is nothing in life that cannot be resolved although it may take time, committing suicide should not be an option. It’s important to share feelings among family members or loved ones because together as a family any problem can be overcome.Embrace the unknown and focus on enhancing your life, instead of worrying about what will happen next. Always find time for your loved ones, as life is uncertain. We should be grateful that we are alive and accept that change is the only constant thing in life. Do not let the unknown, stop you from trying or achieving your goals and always remember that even if you fail, you still have endless opportunities.",['erron border pillar placement plagu nepali farmer madhesh'],"['photo pippen unsplashlif fill surpris unexpect event chang moment .', 'thing certain life uncertainti .', 'chang natur inevit part live , may posit well negative.even though guarante wake morn , set alarm everi night hope wake morn .', 'know day go bring us , may varieti , adventur , endless opportunities.th push exploreth uncertainti sometim forc us explor aspect life , never knew exist need .', 'also test mental strength peopl deal .', 'uncertainti taught grate , never know life throw us.in life , everyth go accord plan , embrac chang face huge troubl .', 'covid-19 pandem best exampl uncertainti , constantli fear death uncertain would see sunris next day.it certain everi decis life correct , fear tri , miss endless opportun learn grow .', 'decis outcom neg side , get depress might tend think commit suicid , forget life endless opportun .', 'us plan career , love life , etc .', 'plan work start get uncomfort .', 'deal today , sure deal tomorrow .', 'need cherish littl moment live know noth perman even failur setbacks.w come noth leav noth .', 'hold ego grudg ?', 'instead make life meaning enjoy journey life , get puzzl accumul wealth go love one .', 'chang certainphoto kathyryn tripp unsplashnoth perman life , everyth chang fraction second .', 'today ’ societi , everyon busi , peopl less time love one .', 'learn year , find time busi schedul famili never know last day togeth .', 'ye !', 'death natur process , die someday , die grudg heart ?', 'instead worri inevit , focus thing control bring lot happi life.uncertainti neg thing ; also bring lot opportun dare chang .', 'life-chang experi come knock door , need expos .', 'learn experi , even though might fail .', 'end world .', 'still rememb hesit appli role leadership , school level certain would chosen.even select , uncertain whether could fulfil respons .', 'uncertainti help grow comfort zone give best input .', 'appli role uncertain outcom , would miss biggest learn opportun school life .', ', let uncertainti unknown ever stop tri matter much tri , plan life alway find way surpris us .', 'import stay ground everyth wish life take turn never expect wildest dream .', 'similarli , noth perman life , financi hardship , grade , breakup , etc .', 'import thing lose hope difficult times.accord data provid nepal polic , around 6,830 peopl took live fiscal year 2022/23 .', 'noth life resolv although may take time , commit suicid option .', '’ import share feel among famili member love one togeth famili problem overcome.embrac unknown focu enhanc life , instead worri happen next .', 'alway find time love one , life uncertain .', 'grate aliv accept chang constant thing life .', 'let unknown , stop tri achiev goal alway rememb even fail , still endless opportun .']"

ANFA renews Vincenzo Alberto Annese’s contract,"Nepali footballers celebrate with the fans after winning the Prime Minister’s Three Nations Cup in March 2023. Nepal played its first international football match on October 13, 1972 in Beijing. Despite scoring two goals, Nepal was defeated by China who scored six. Furthermore, YB Ghale holds the distinction of being recognised as the first Nepali footballer to score an international goal. This happened during the 1982 Asian Games in New Delhi, India, where he netted a goal against Kuwait.If you want to research the roots of domestic football in Nepal, you have to go back to the Rana Regime. The Tribhuvan Challenge Shield, inaugurated in 1948, stands as one of the oldest football tournaments in the country. Soon the All Nepal Football Association (ANFA), the governing body overseeing football activities in Nepal, was established in 1951.Currently, Nepali football finds itself at a crucial juncture, facing a do-or-die situation. The challenges and dynamics present in contemporary Nepal are mirrored in the world of football, adding an extra layer of significance to the sport’s current state in the country.Worry state of footballThe football turf at Dasharath Stadium is in a dire state. Photo: Bikash Shrestha Nepali football continues to grapple with a lack of infrastructure for football matches, whether at the national or international level. The Dasharath Stadium stands as the solitary international venue in the country, catering to both international matches and crucial domestic competitions. Its post-2015 earthquake reconstruction was specifically undertaken to ensure its readiness for hosting events like the South Asian Games. The existing stadiums and grounds in Nepal are insufficient, and the football grounds in cities like Pokhara and Biratnagar still lack professional management. Additionally, the primary national league for domestic football, the Martyr’s Memorial A-Division League, has been constrained to the Kathmandu Valley. While in earlier editions matches were also held in Pokhara, recent seasons have seen a shift, with matches no longer being played at PokharaIn the 45th edition of the Martyr’s Memorial A-Division League in 2023, 14 teams participated in the competition. Despite the significant number of participating teams, the quality of the football matches fell short of audience expectations. The matches held during the event failed to attract the desired viewership. Consequently, the ongoing Nepal Super League has strategically scheduled matches in the evening, possibly as an effort to enhance audience engagement and attendance.Furthermore, fans have expressed disillusionment with the A Division League, citing ANFA’s inability to establish a consistent schedule each year. Both in the A Division League and the Nepal Super League, teams frequently play matches twice or thrice a week, exposing players to a higher risk of injuries. The duration of domestic leagues remains limited, and significant gaps exist between football competitions on the national stage. During these periods of inactivity, players face the added challenge of no earnings, emphasising the financial strain on Nepali footballers during lulls in the football calendar.Question of sustainabilitydanielkirsch for PixabayThe salary of a footballer in the Nepali football national team is very low. It is difficult to sustain economically by Nepali players because most national footballers do not get sponsors.At present, a few players play in foreign leagues and represent in Nepali football national team. Players want to play for Nepal but their economic condition pushes them away from football. The domestic league of Nepal is completed in such a short time interval that these players do not know what to do for more than half of a year when there is no league at all.Likewise, looking at the history of the domestic league in Nepal, there is no certainty that the league will occur in the scheduled period. Before the onset of the Covid pandemic, A-Division clubs were actively engaged in district-level cup tournaments. However, these tournaments have nearly ground to a halt in the aftermath of the pandemic. Additionally, businesses have shown reluctance to invest in Nepali football, largely due to the economic crisis brought on by the pandemic. The challenging economic landscape has had a cascading effect, affecting both the grassroots-level tournaments and the willingness of businesses to contribute to the development of Nepali football.The grassroots level of Nepali football faces significant challenges. There is a noticeable absence of grassroots competitions across the country. In the Kathmandu Valley, the scarcity of grounds further restricts children’s access to play football.While futsal grounds have been established, their small size and associated costs limit accessibility. These futsal facilities are not easily available to the wider public. Moreover, schools tend to be less enthusiastic about promoting games and sports like football due to a shortage of grounds and concerns about the potential for injuries in such sports. The overall scenario underscores the need for increased infrastructure, affordability, and a more encouraging environment to nurture football at the grassroots level in Nepal.Ever evolving footballNepali footballers struggled to keep the ball most of the time in their match against Laos during the Three Nations Cup in March 2023. Photo: Chandra Bahadur AleModern football is evolving day by day. Legendary footballers once prominent in European football leagues are now making their mark in Asia’s Saudi Pro League. Our neighbour, India, has also undergone a significant transformation in football through the Indian Super League (ISL).Under the leadership of footballer Sunil Chhetri, Indian football has experienced a remarkable change over the past decade. Chhetri’s influence has played a pivotal role in shaping the face of Indian football. The last time Nepal’s national side secured a victory against India was in the 2013 SAFF Championship.Since then, India has tremendously worked on the quality of its football team, which is visible in the FIFA rankings along with its domestic infrastructure and the opportunities the players get.  However, FIFA rankings are not the only factor that decides the future of the football national team, which probably means there is still hope for the Nepali football team.With the FIFA World Cup 2026, which is supposed to be held in Canada, Mexico and the United States extending teams number up to 48, FIFA World Cup Qualifiers have been more exciting and thrilling than before.Now, we can see Asian teams performing good quality football matches because it was not expected the same before with Asian teams. Now, football is expanding from its boundary of Europe or South America domination because, in the decade of 2020, we have seen huge changes in football in North America, Africa and Asia including Australia.In Nepal’s case, the ANFA currently lacks a comprehensive visionary roadmap to reach the Asian Cup and FIFA World Cup. Getting to these tournaments requires the national team to approach each match with a focus on gaining experience and acquiring the necessary skills. A mindset that prioritises learning over immediate results is crucial for preparing the team to tackle future challenges effectively. Nepal has consistently produced energetic and skilful players and hired coaches who exhibit comparable levels of energy and proficiency to their counterparts in European or other football teams.However, for football to yield positive outcomes, it is crucial to have visionary leaders and committees within ANFA and the National Sports Council who possess a deep understanding of the sport. There seems to be a perception that individuals in key positions in ANFA and the National Sports Council may not fully grasp that football is not merely a game; it also serves as a representation of a nation to the rest of the world.Another thing is that Nepali football is compared with the Nepali national men’s cricket team. Nepali men’s senior team played in the Asia Cup for the first time and it also qualified for the T20 World Cup in 2024.The first thing one needs to understand is that football and cricket are two different sports. These two sports should not be compared with each other. We are Nepali and we should support both sports and other sports. Sports are also representations of the nation. So, as a Nepali, let’s support football too.It is time that concerned authorities should recognise that football is not only a sport but also the emotions of millions of Nepali football fans.",['anfa

Nepal Super League kicking off on Friday with Kathmandu Rayzrs taking on Sporting Ilam,"Gulshan Jha raises his bat after scoring a half-century against Oman in the final of the T20 World Cup Asia Qualifier. Throughout the past year, Gulshan Jha has proven his ability to thrive in clutch situations. Whenever Nepal has needed a player to step up, Jha has consistently risen to the occasion.The recently held T20 World Cup Asia Qualifier is evidence of that. Despiting finishing second, his performance during the tournament was such that he was declared the best Nepali player as the team qualified for the 2024 T20 World Cup which will be held in the US and the West Indies in 2024.Jha excelled with both the bat and ball. While his career has only just begun, people are already dubbing him Nepal’s perfect all-rounder.Standing outGulshan Jha made a name for himself during the Mayor’s Cup in 2020. His performance with the ball in hand against the Armed Police Force during the final caught a lot of attention as he helped Nepal Police win the tournament.Since then there has been no looking back for Jha. He has played a significant role in all the achievements of the Nepali cricket team over the last year. From winning 11 out of 12 matches in the ICC World Cup Cricket League 2 to facing formidable teams like India and Pakistan in the Asia Cup, Jha has made noteworthy contributions.Even with limited appearances in ODI and T20 matches, he has already showcased his calibre as an all-rounder. His performances in the Tri-Series Nation and the final of the final for the T20 World Cup Qualifier have demonstrated that he is equally adept as an all-rounder in T20 cricket.In the T20 World Cup Qualifier, Jha scored 79 runs in five matches, including one half-century, despite playing only three innings. His standout performance came in the final against Oman, where he scored an impressive 54 runs off just 25 balls, contributing significantly to Nepal’s respectable total of 184.Despite picking up only five wickets, Jha shown with the ball in hand has he kept troubling the batters with pace and bounce.“It feels great to have won the best Nepali player. I am just happy to have helped the team get to the World Cup,” he says.Following the footstepsGulshan Jha celebrates taking the wicket of Aqyb Ilyas in the final of the T20 World Cup Qualifier in Kathmandu on November 5, 2023. He recalls watching the T20 World Cup in Bangladesh and being inspired by the performances of Paras Khadka, Gyanendra Malla, and Sharad Vesawkar. According to him, they played a crucial role in motivating him to pursue a career in cricket.“I wanted to be them. Sometimes it feels surreal that I am one of them now,” he says.Gulshan Jha is aware of the expectations and pressure placed on him, understanding that he must consistently develop and enhance his skills as a cricketer. Recognising the dynamic and competitive nature of the sport, he is committed to ongoing growth and improvement to meet the demands and challenges of the game.He performed admirably during the ODI World Cup Qualifier in Zimbabwe and received praise from former cricketing greats.“Gulshan is a special talent. Although he is in the early stage of his career he has already played significant innings in T20Is and ODIs,” says former cricketer Sharad Vesawkar, former cricketer. “Currently, there is good team management and in the future things will improve more.”  Vesawkar believes Jha has all the qualities to be one of the best all-rounders Nepal has ever seen and emulate the great Paras Khadka.“He is a legend and the best. He is one of the reasons why cricket in Nepal is where it is today. I hope to emulate him but I understand he is unparalleled,” he says.Jha expresses his commitment to fulfilling the responsibilities assigned by the coach. He is actively working on improving both his batting and bowling skills.“I am giving my best to be a better all-rounder.” Big match playerGulshan Jha after hitting the winning runs against the UAE during the ICC Men’s Cricket World Cup League 2 in Kathmandu on March 16. Gulshan Jha has proven to be a big-match player, delivering all-round performances in both ODI and T20 formats.In the final match of ICC Cricket World Cup League 2, he won Nepal the game single-handedly by scoring an unbeaten 50 against the UAE. He has proven to be the UAE’s nemesis as he helped Nepal beat them in the ACC Premier Cup final with an unbeaten 67 to take Nepal to the Asia Cup. Jha has been consistent even in T20Is. In the T20 World Cup Asia Qualifier, he made significant contributions with the bat. His aggressive batting against Oman at TU Cricket Ground in Kirtipur played a pivotal role in Nepal posting 184 runs.Nepal faced a challenging start, managing only 60 runs and losing four wickets in the initial 10 overs. However, Jha’s entry into the batting lineup marked a turning point for Nepal. Jha’s 78-run partnership with captain Rohit Paudel settled the innings as Nepal posted a competitive total. Jha finished with 54 runs off 25 balls, achieving his first half-century.Former cricketer Vesawkar says that despite having played only around 15 T20I matches, Jha has already showcased significant potential.“Gulshan has been playing well in pressure situations. I feel we have unearthed a gem,” says Vesawkar. “Now we should focus on improving him and make sure he is not overworked and is free from injuries.”",['nepal super leagu kick friday kathmandu rayzr take sport ilam'],"['gulshan jha rais bat score half-centuri oman final t20 world cup asia qualifi .', 'throughout past year , gulshan jha proven abil thrive clutch situat .', 'whenev nepal need player step , jha consist risen occasion.th recent held t20 world cup asia qualifi evid .', 'despit finish second , perform tournament declar best nepali player team qualifi 2024 t20 world cup held us west indi 2024.jha excel bat ball .', 'career begun , peopl alreadi dub nepal ’ perfect all-rounder.stand outgulshan jha made name mayor ’ cup 2020 .', 'perform ball hand arm polic forc final caught lot attent help nepal polic win tournament.sinc look back jha .', 'play signific role achiev nepali cricket team last year .', 'win 11 12 match icc world cup cricket leagu 2 face formid team like india pakistan asia cup , jha made noteworthi contributions.even limit appear odi t20 match , alreadi showcas calibr all-round .', 'perform tri-seri nation final final t20 world cup qualifi demonstr equal adept all-round t20 cricket.in t20 world cup qualifi , jha score 79 run five match , includ one half-centuri , despit play three inning .', 'standout perform came final oman , score impress 54 run 25 ball , contribut significantli nepal ’ respect total 184.despit pick five wicket , jha shown ball hand kept troubl batter pace bounc . “ feel great best nepali player .', 'happi help team get world cup , ” says.follow footstepsgulshan jha celebr take wicket aqyb ilya final t20 world cup qualifi kathmandu novemb 5 , 2023 .', 'recal watch t20 world cup bangladesh inspir perform para khadka , gyanendra malla , sharad vesawkar .', 'accord , play crucial role motiv pursu career cricket . “ want .', 'sometim feel surreal one , ” says.gulshan jha awar expect pressur place , understand must consist develop enhanc skill cricket .', 'recognis dynam competit natur sport , commit ongo growth improv meet demand challeng game.h perform admir odi world cup qualifi zimbabw receiv prais former cricket great . “ gulshan special talent .', 'although earli stage career alreadi play signific inning t20i odi , ” say former cricket sharad vesawkar , former cricket .', '“ current , good team manag futur thing improv more . ” vesawkar believ jha qualiti one best all-round nepal ever seen emul great para khadka . “ legend best .', 'one reason cricket nepal today .', 'hope emul understand unparallel , ” says.jha express commit fulfil respons assign coach .', 'activ work improv bat bowl skill . “ give best better all-round . ” big match playergulshan jha hit win run uae icc men ’ cricket world cup leagu 2 kathmandu march 16 .', 'gulshan jha proven big-match player , deliv all-round perform odi t20 formats.in final match icc cricket world cup leagu 2 , nepal game single-handedli score unbeaten 50 uae .', 'proven uae ’ nemesi help nepal beat acc premier cup final unbeaten 67 take nepal asia cup .', 'jha consist even t20i .', 't20 world cup asia qualifi , made signific contribut bat .', 'aggress bat oman tu cricket ground kirtipur play pivot role nepal post 184 runs.nep face challeng start , manag 60 run lose four wicket initi 10 over .', 'howev , jha ’ entri bat lineup mark turn point nepal .', 'jha ’ 78-run partnership captain rohit paudel settl inning nepal post competit total .', 'jha finish 54 run 25 ball , achiev first half-century.form cricket vesawkar say despit play around 15 t20i match , jha alreadi showcas signific potenti . “ gulshan play well pressur situat .', 'feel unearth gem , ” say vesawkar .', '“ focu improv make sure overwork free injuri . ”']"
FIFA World Cup Qualifier: Nepal humbled by UAE,"Pankaj Bikram NembangPankaj Bikram Nembang, the president of the All Nepal Football Association, dodged a bullet on November 9. Nembang, who faced a vote of confidence, came through unscathed. However, the road ahead is challenging, as he is destined to encounter tough tests while continuing to lead Nepali football.Nembang was elected the president of ANFA on June 21, 2022, after defeating former president Karma Tsering Sherpa by six votes. A challenging year later, he faced near removal from ANFA as members expressed dissatisfaction with his perceived failure to effectively lead Nepali football.Despite having multiple plans, Pankaj Bikram Nembang has struggled to execute them as intended. On the day of the oath-taking ceremony, he appointed a general secretary and treasurer without a predefined agenda, sparking controversy. This gradually snowballed as a majority of members, led by Karma Tsering Sherpa, on September 11 submitted a written application to dismiss Nembang and general secretary Kiran Rai.Pankaj Bikram Nembang is the first ANFA president to face a vote of confidence.According to Article 36 of ANFA’s statute, there is a provision for convening a special general convention. If 40 per cent of the members submit a written request for such a convention, the working committee is obligated to organize it within a 30-day timeframe.On October 4, an emergency meeting of the ANFA working committee called for a special general meeting on November 9, with the sole agenda of removing Nembang.Same old ANFAPankaj Bikram Nembang and Kiran Rai.The meeting was held in Hetauda. Before the voting could take place, Nembang addressed the ANFA members. When those who filed for his removal asked to speak, they were denied. That sparked further fury as the disgruntled faction led by former ANFA president Sherpa decided to leave the meeting and not take part in the voting at all.“They did not let us speak. They did not follow the regulations. There was no point in staying in the meeting,” says Karma Tsiring Sherpa.Sherpa contends that voting proceeded without the approval of the agenda. Nevertheless, the voting was carried out. Out of the 107 members of ANFA, 87 hold voting rights but 34 abstained from the voting process. That meant only 53 members cast votes, and of those, 52 votes were deemed valid. Notably, all the votes were in favour of Nembang staying in office as ANFA president.“He has saved his post. But this shows how things in ANFA will never change. There are many challenges Pankaj has to face. I don’t see the situation changing as he will face even more scrutiny,” says an ANFA central member on the condition of anonymity.Challenging futureR-L: Karma Tsering Sherpa and Pankaj Bikram Nembang, ANFA presidency aspirantsUpon being elected as president, Pankaj Bikram Nembang expressed his commitment to treating everyone equally, ensuring financial transparency, and establishing a women’s football academy. Additionally, he stated that during his tenure, Nepal would secure victory in the SAFF Championship and initiate the national league.However, up to this point, he has not fulfilled these promises. The Martyr’s Memorial ‘A’ Division League that he organised faced numerous issues. Failing to conduct the B Division and C Division, along with the inability to organise the second round of the National Women’s League and the Lalit Memorial U19 competition, has been another setback. The performance of both the men’s and women’s teams has been subpar, leading to a significant number of national footballers leaving the country, with many relocating to Australia. This has resulted in a deterioration of the structure and strength of the national football team.The Nepali football’s governing body is currently entangled in internal conflicts, and even the special meeting failed to address these issues. In this challenging situation, Nembang must engage in effective collaboration with the disgruntled group to navigate through the prevalent conflicts.“He should improve the relationship with everyone,” says a central member of ANFA. “Now the leagues should be organised and financial transparency should be maintained, otherwise there will be trouble.”ANFA knows that the upcoming days will be challenging. Suresh Shah, the spokesperson has called for calm and asked everyone to come together for the betterment of Nepali football.“We should not be fighting amongst ourselves. That will kill Nepali football. We should work together to develop Nepali football. For that, ANFA is always up for a rational discussion with anyone,” says Shah.Sherpa, the leader of the dissident group, insists that ANFA should adhere to the established rules and regulations, emphasising the need for efficient management within the football sector. “We will support ANFA if they will work properly,” says Sherpa. Nevertheless, with Pankaj Bikram Nembang still in charge, one can expect that Nepali football is poised to encounter further drama.",['fifa world cup qualifi : nepal humbl uae'],"['pankaj bikram nembangpankaj bikram nembang , presid nepal footbal associ , dodg bullet novemb 9 .', 'nembang , face vote confid , came unscath .', 'howev , road ahead challeng , destin encount tough test continu lead nepali football.nembang elect presid anfa june 21 , 2022 , defeat former presid karma tsere sherpa six vote .', 'challeng year later , face near remov anfa member express dissatisfact perceiv failur effect lead nepali football.despit multipl plan , pankaj bikram nembang struggl execut intend .', 'day oath-tak ceremoni , appoint gener secretari treasur without predefin agenda , spark controversi .', 'gradual snowbal major member , led karma tsere sherpa , septemb 11 submit written applic dismiss nembang gener secretari kiran rai.pankaj bikram nembang first anfa presid face vote confidence.accord articl 36 anfa ’ statut , provis conven special gener convent .', '40 per cent member submit written request convent , work committe oblig organ within 30-day timeframe.on octob 4 , emerg meet anfa work committe call special gener meet novemb 9 , sole agenda remov nembang.sam old anfapankaj bikram nembang kiran rai.th meet held hetauda .', 'vote could take place , nembang address anfa member .', 'file remov ask speak , deni .', 'spark furi disgruntl faction led former anfa presid sherpa decid leav meet take part vote all . “ let us speak .', 'follow regul .', 'point stay meet , ” say karma tsire sherpa.sherpa contend vote proceed without approv agenda .', 'nevertheless , vote carri .', '107 member anfa , 87 hold vote right 34 abstain vote process .', 'meant 53 member cast vote , , 52 vote deem valid .', 'notabl , vote favour nembang stay offic anfa presid . “ save post .', 'show thing anfa never chang .', 'mani challeng pankaj face .', '’ see situat chang face even scrutini , ” say anfa central member condit anonymity.challeng futurer-l : karma tsere sherpa pankaj bikram nembang , anfa presid aspirantsupon elect presid , pankaj bikram nembang express commit treat everyon equal , ensur financi transpar , establish women ’ footbal academi .', 'addit , state tenur , nepal would secur victori saff championship initi nation league.howev , point , fulfil promis .', 'martyr ’ memori ‘ ’ divis leagu organis face numer issu .', 'fail conduct b divis c divis , along inabl organis second round nation women ’ leagu lalit memori u19 competit , anoth setback .', 'perform men ’ women ’ team subpar , lead signific number nation footbal leav countri , mani reloc australia .', 'result deterior structur strength nation footbal team.th nepali footbal ’ govern bodi current entangl intern conflict , even special meet fail address issu .', 'challeng situat , nembang must engag effect collabor disgruntl group navig preval conflict . “ improv relationship everyon , ” say central member anfa .', '“ leagu organis financi transpar maintain , otherwis troubl . ” anfa know upcom day challeng .', 'suresh shah , spokesperson call calm ask everyon come togeth better nepali footbal . “ fight amongst .', 'kill nepali footbal .', 'work togeth develop nepali footbal .', ', anfa alway ration discuss anyon , ” say shah.sherpa , leader dissid group , insist anfa adher establish rule regul , emphasis need effici manag within footbal sector .', '“ support anfa work properli , ” say sherpa .', 'nevertheless , pankaj bikram nembang still charg , one expect nepali footbal pois encount drama .']"

Ramesh Limbu and Anita Rai win Manjushree Trail Race,"Over the past decade, cricket in Nepal has overtaken football to be the country’s most beloved sport. In a nation beset by political strife, internal unrest, economic instability, and natural disasters like earthquakes and accidents, it is only natural for cricket to provide a sense of joy and excitement to its populace. Cricket in Nepal has proven to be a unifying force among the youth, bridging divides of caste, region, and religion. According to Joseph Nye, a professor at Harvard University, the term ‘soft power’ refers to a country’s ability to attract and influence others without resorting to force or coercion. This definition can be found in his book titled ‘Soft Power: The Means to Succeed in World Politics’, published in 2004. This article aims to spotlight the current developments in cricket in Nepal, using examples from various countries. It also delves into the government’s stance towards the sport and explores potential opportunities for diplomatic connections.Latest development in cricketThe Nepal cricket team celebrate after winning the ACC Men’s Premier Cup, in Kathmandu, on May 2, 2023.Cricket in Nepal has achieved a notable feat by earning a spot in the 2024 T20 World Cup in the US and the West Indies, thanks to their impressive performance during a match held on their home turf. After a decade-long pursuit, their aspiration of reaching the World Cup has finally come to fruition, having gained valuable experience from their participation in the 2014 event.Nepalis still hold dear the memory of Nepal’s victory over Afghanistan in 2014. Soon, cricket enthusiasts in Nepal will once again have the opportunity to take on the best in the world and share special memories.Our head coach, Monti Desai, has played a crucial role in securing Nepal’s ODI recognition. He mentored and coached the Nepali team to an impressive 11 out of 12 victories in the Cricket World Cup League and was integral as Nepal qualified for the Asia Cup where they took on Asian heavyweights India and Pakistan.What stands out the most is how he facilitated valuable interactions between Indian and Nepali players, greatly boosting the morale of the Nepali team. Thanks to his guidance, Nepal once again secured qualification for the World Cup.During this, Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal has also displayed unwavering support for players during big tournaments. He recently distributed the cash prizes that the government had pledged, as he has consistently reiterated his commitment to being an instigator for the development of cricket in Nepal.In line with the progress of cricket in Nepal, the government has expressed its commitment to completing the construction of the Mulpani Cricket Ground and to building stadiums in Chitwan and Biratnagar as part of the national pride project.”Following the development of cricket in Nepal, the government has also said it is committed to completing the works on the Mulpani Cricket Ground (lower) and build stadiums in Chitwan and Biratnagar under the national pride project.Lessons to learnIndian fans during the 2015 Cricket World Cup in Australia. Photo: Wikimedia CommonsWhen discussing cricket development, it is essential to consider how the sport has evolved and continues to progress in India, Australia, and England.In India, cricket has united a diverse nation for decades. The Indian cricket team is a merit-based team that attracts talent from across the country, regardless of nepotism or favouritism. Cricket has served as a powerful tool for India to showcase its national identity and rich culture, while also facilitating the growth of economic and cultural relationships with other nations. The Indian Premier League (IPL) is a prime illustration of this, having played a significant role in bolstering India’s appeal to foreign investments and tourism.Cricket, a sport that originated in the United Kingdom, is dominated by India. India is home to the Global Cricket Academy, and the Board for Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) is currently the richest cricket board in the world. The net worth of the International Cricket Council (ICC) is just over USD 2.5 billion, whereas the BCCI’s net worth is USD 2.25 billion.Australia’s rich history in cricket has helped the country promote its sporting prowess and welcoming image. Cricket Australia is the second richest cricket board at USD 70 million. The Australian cricket team has dominated world cricket as it has time and again displayed its ruthless aggression and winning spirit.A widely held belief is that cricket was introduced to India during British colonial rule. As British interests expanded globally, the sport spread to other countries. The passion and adoration English fans have for cricket is truly a sight to behold. In an era when test cricket is facing challenges, the way English supporters flock to stadiums across the country to watch their team play is commendable and serves as an inspiration for cricket fans around the world.Importance of soft power and role of cricketThe British Brand Finance Institute has determined that the US currently holds the top position for soft power among 128 countries worldwide. Following closely behind is the UK in second, Germany in third, China in fourth and Japan in fifth. Additionally, India has impressively improved their ranking from 36th to 28th place compared to the previous year.The utilisation of cricket as a diplomatic tool or a means of exerting soft power has gained increasing significance in today’s world. Nepal currently holds the 15th position in the ICC’s ODI rankings and 16th position in the T20 rankings. By employing cricket diplomacy, Nepal has the potential to enhance its national image and elevate its global standing. Here are five strategies through which Nepal can capitalise on its cricketing strength:1. Host international cricket events – Nepal can host cricketing events of international significance, such as the Asia Cup or a tri-series with neighbouring countries, to bring attention to the country’s infrastructure, development, and hospitality, in addition to its cultural attractions. This would not only showcase the country’s cricketing talent but also its capacity to organise large-scale events.2. Engage with the international cricket community – Furthermore, leveraging cricket as a vehicle for social initiatives, such as advocating for education, health awareness, or gender equality, can attest to Nepal’s unwavering commitment to social advancement while simultaneously enhancing its international standing. This can entail collaborating with NGOs and other organizations to champion social causes and harnessing cricket events to raise awareness and generate funding.3. Promote Nepali cricketers as role models – Highlighting the accomplishments of Nepali cricketers can inspire young Nepalis and project a positive image of the country’s potential and talent in sports.4. Encourage grassroots cricket development – Expanding the reach of cricket and creating opportunities for underprivileged youth can be achieved through investing in grassroots cricket development, particularly in rural areas. Nepal’s commitment to inclusive development is evident in the potential of constructing cricket pitches and training facilities in remote regions, as well as providing coaching and support to budding cricketers. By doing so, we can empower young people with the skills and confidence to pursue their dreams and contribute to their communities.5. Cricket diplomacy to strengthen ties with neighbouring countries– Cricket diplomacy can be employed as the fifth strategy to enhance Nepal’s international standing and foster regional cooperation with neighbouring countries like India and Bangladesh. Joint cricket events and initiatives can be organized with neighbouring countries, and cricket can be effectively used as a means for cultural exchange and cooperation.By actively implementing these strategies, Nepal can showcase itself as a vibrant, welcoming, and sports-loving nation while projecting a positive image of its cultural heritage, youth potential, and commitment to social

Didier Drogba to be part of Nepal Super League,"As untouched and less discussed as the sports management industry is in Nepal, it has ample room to showcase creativity. Photo by Miguel Bruna on UnsplashIn 2023, Barbie named Women in Sports as their career of the year.Whenever I am out and about socially, there is always someone who seems pretty certain about not considering my profession as mainstream. Hold up! Sports as a career? In Nepal? You bet! This article aims to explain why women in this male-dominant sports industry in Nepal should not be viewed as a surprise.I have been part of the Nepali cricket industry in a private capacity for quite a while now. Armed with a Master’s Degree in IT from an American University, my choice to stick with sports management tends to raise eyebrows. While I am not an on-field player, I am definitely behind the scenes, playing strong games of serious deliverance with my team. We are all about creating what is not there.As untouched and less discussed as the sports management industry is in Nepal, it has ample room to showcase creativity. Being a commanding woman in a position can be challenging, but on the brighter side, the gender advantage has yet to fail me. As alien as I might be in sports management in Nepal, I have been accepted with open arms. The nature of the job is highly competitive, no doubt.Embraced by the sports fraternityPhoto: PixabayWomen in sports are safe, heard, and welcomed. I absolutely relish the addition of spirited women to the team. The nuances of sports are something women complement greatly. Sports management inherently rejects narrow minds. There is a lot of travelling, meeting people, experimenting, and remembering limitations. The adjustments are both trivial and clever. Often, in our part of the world, societal norms limit women from making career decisions, hindering them from living life on their terms. This restriction potentially keeps many capable women from pursuing the sports industry, where they could truly wield their power to make an impact. Change is gradual, and I hope to see numerous female faces in charge of stadiums someday in Nepal.Yes, there are challenges. It ranges from personal sacrifices to job security and opportunities. However, these are workable factors for any freelancer in sports management. The key is excelling at our jobs to thrive anywhere. Taking a page from the medical field, the seriousness we apply there should not differ in sports management. Sports is a powerful industry. Children grow up idolising what we showcase on TV. As glorious as the game is, it is every child’s dream to represent their country someday. Carrying that responsibility is our role in sports—an often thankless yet deeply satisfying job.Nepali sports industryThe fans went wild at TU Cricket Ground after Nepal beat UAE.Sports may be a smaller industry in Nepal, but globally, it is a behemoth. The world economy has shifted, and it is time we alter our perspective to recognise the potential of sports as an industry in Nepal. The idea of open commercialisation of sports remains somewhat unexplored, as it continues to be a more exclusive affair in Nepal. By sourcing innovative ideas, there’s a wealth of public attention and investment waiting to be tapped into, along with numerous practices to establish and discard. As the Nepali team achieves international records, the packaging of the sport becomes everything. There is plenty to learn from international sports management to make our industry highly marketable and poised for global entry.Sports such as cricket, football, volleyball, or even golf serve as key intersections for reshaping Nepal’s global narrative. Over the years, Kabaddi has witnessed a substantial surge in India, both in terms of viewership and commercial success. The primary challenge we grapple with is Nepal’s comparatively small market size, posing constraints on our ability to generate substantial economic gains. Therefore, there is unanimous agreement on the imperative for Nepal’s sports to venture onto the international stage.Nepal boasts many hardworking individuals, yet achieving this goal demands specialised talents in sports management with the requisite experience and the capacity to enhance existing values. In the long run, outsourcing such talents may foster dependence. Hence, a concerted effort is needed to inspire Nepali youth to engage in sports management, contributing to our sports ecosystem. There are various ways in which we can harness the potential of sports for our benefit. Encouraging youth involvement can be instrumental in capitalising on the multifaceted opportunities presented by the sports industry. There is a lot to explore if you think about it.",['didier drogba part nepal super leagu'],"['untouch less discuss sport manag industri nepal , ampl room showcas creativ .', 'photo miguel bruna unsplashin 2023 , barbi name women sport career year.whenev social , alway someon seem pretti certain consid profess mainstream .', 'hold !', 'sport career ?', 'nepal ?', 'bet !', 'articl aim explain women male-domin sport industri nepal view surprise.i part nepali cricket industri privat capac quit .', 'arm master ’ degre american univers , choic stick sport manag tend rais eyebrow .', 'on-field player , definit behind scene , play strong game seriou deliver team .', 'creat there.a untouch less discuss sport manag industri nepal , ampl room showcas creativ .', 'command woman posit challeng , brighter side , gender advantag yet fail .', 'alien might sport manag nepal , accept open arm .', 'natur job highli competit , doubt.embrac sport fraternityphoto : pixabaywomen sport safe , heard , welcom .', 'absolut relish addit spirit women team .', 'nuanc sport someth women complement greatli .', 'sport manag inher reject narrow mind .', 'lot travel , meet peopl , experi , rememb limit .', 'adjust trivial clever .', 'often , part world , societ norm limit women make career decis , hinder live life term .', 'restrict potenti keep mani capabl women pursu sport industri , could truli wield power make impact .', 'chang gradual , hope see numer femal face charg stadium someday nepal.y , challeng .', 'rang person sacrific job secur opportun .', 'howev , workabl factor freelanc sport manag .', 'key excel job thrive anywher .', 'take page medic field , serious appli differ sport manag .', 'sport power industri .', 'children grow idolis showcas tv .', 'gloriou game , everi child ’ dream repres countri someday .', 'carri respons role sports—an often thankless yet deepli satisfi job.nepali sport industryth fan went wild tu cricket ground nepal beat uae.sport may smaller industri nepal , global , behemoth .', 'world economi shift , time alter perspect recognis potenti sport industri nepal .', 'idea open commercialis sport remain somewhat unexplor , continu exclus affair nepal .', 'sourc innov idea , ’ wealth public attent invest wait tap , along numer practic establish discard .', 'nepali team achiev intern record , packag sport becom everyth .', 'plenti learn intern sport manag make industri highli market pois global entry.sport cricket , footbal , volleybal , even golf serv key intersect reshap nepal ’ global narr .', 'year , kabaddi wit substanti surg india , term viewership commerci success .', 'primari challeng grappl nepal ’ compar small market size , pose constraint abil gener substanti econom gain .', 'therefor , unanim agreement imper nepal ’ sport ventur onto intern stage.nep boast mani hardwork individu , yet achiev goal demand specialis talent sport manag requisit experi capac enhanc exist valu .', 'long run , outsourc talent may foster depend .', 'henc , concert effort need inspir nepali youth engag sport manag , contribut sport ecosystem .', 'variou way har potenti sport benefit .', 'encourag youth involv instrument capitalis multifacet opportun present sport industri .', 'lot explor think .']"
"Mulpani, Chitwan and Biratnagar cricket stadiums declared as national pride projects","Painting ‘My Private Life’ by artist Priyam Pradhan at the exhibition Mani at Siddhartha Art Gallery, Baber Mahal. Photo: Chandra Bahadur AleUsing Pitt’s artist pen on paper, artist Priyam Pradhan presents My Private Life, a showcase of the current significance of his life depicted in abstract form.At the centre of the painting is a 1000-rupee note, within which Pradhan has intricately painted Lord Krishna, a man wearing a hoodie tenderly embracing his dog, and a woman. The woman stands tall, elongated in form. Towards the bottom of the canvas, a holy man reaches out his hands, appearing to be in flight.Priyam Pradhan has used a vibrant colour palette, incorporating bright hues such as pink, orange, and yellow, as well as green, black, white, and grey. This combination adds a dynamic and lively quality to the artwork.“The man in the centre is me and the girl in green is my girlfriend. And the faces are my mom and dad,” says Pradhan. “The sadhu (holy man) symbolises my desires that I don’t have many desires for materialistic things however I do understand the value of money.”The use of colours, figures and lines in an abstract form in his painting resembles the painting of American painter Paul Jackson Pollock. Like his abstract expressionism, Pradhan has expressed himself in his painting.Furthermore, this marks Priyam Pradhan’s third solo painting exhibition titled Mani (money), inaugurated on January 17 at Siddhartha Art Gallery, Baber Mahal.In his previous exhibitions, Pradhan’s artworks centred around Hindu philosophy and his spontaneous thought process. However, in this latest exhibition, he explores the theme of money and its impact on an individual’s life, delving into the reverberating effects of financial aspects.Understanding the value of moneyPaintings by artist Priyam Pradhan at Siddhartha Art Gallery, Baber Mahal. Photo: Chandra Bahadur AleAny form of art is known as a reflection of the contemporary time. Likewise, Priyam Pradhan’s paintings reflect the lifestyle, desires, obligations and more of today’s younger generation living in urban areas in Nepal.Pradhan himself is in his 20s and he has justified the want of most of the youngsters in their 20s, who might be declared adults and understand the need for money and materialistic things but are still kids at their heart who want to explore and experience life as much as possible.The exhibition has 27 paintings which Pradhan took around nine months to complete. According to him, while he was travelling the idea that his life was luxurious and him being capable of exploring anything he wanted to was because of money.And being an artist this concept lingered on him and he was compelled to create on the theme of money.Once you enter the gallery, you can also view an animated video, which introduces artist Pradhan and the importance of money, which is on the ground floor. On the first floor, a huge painting (193×62 in cm) Apatkalin Awastha using mixed media on canvas welcomes you and other paintings are small in size (18×30 in cm).“It is a team work and it is my introduction as an artist for the exhibition,” he says. “Also, being a recent multimedia graduate from Islington College, I wanted to explore my skills and I got my team. Then, like money, multimedia is relevant to current society.”Experiencing life through artPainting by artist Priyam Pradhan at Siddhartha Art Gallery, Baber Mahal. Photo: Chandra Bahadur Ale Priyam Pradhan says enjoyment is the meaning of life and he enjoys creating artwork. Moreover, Pradhan who came into the art world first being a tattoo artist feels blessed that he has the privilege to explore whatever he likes in his life.He also believes that the philosophy that says one should not be materialistic is wrong. “If material things are not important, why would one build a house? And after building a house why do they want to decorate their house?” he questions.Alongside, money and materialistic things, his paintings also explore love, romance, life and childhood experiences. Motifs like Pokemon, ramen noodles, animals, dancers, etc have been used in his paintings. In most of his paintings, he has used numerous white lines in wavy form and these lines for Pradhan indicate the sound or the energy that exists in the surroundings all the time.About using a pitta artist pen, he says, “I have enjoyed drawing and painting since my childhood and using a pitta artist pen helps me revisit that feeling of happiness and sense of freedom.”So many things happening on the canvas with the use of vibrant colours gives a sense of excitement to the viewers. Though referencing artists like Pollock, MF Husain, Picasso and more, his pen strokes give a sense of newness through his expression and thoughts about his life experiences.In his paintings, these bright colours and motifs are in harmony and are visual treats that can surely cheer up the mood of any visitor. Moreover, you can also get free stickers from the artist.If you too are in a gloomy mood and want to uplift a little, visit the exhibition that continues till February 6.","['mulpani , chitwan biratnagar cricket stadium declar nation pride project']","['paint ‘ privat life ’ artist priyam pradhan exhibit mani siddhartha art galleri , baber mahal .', 'photo : chandra bahadur aleus pitt ’ artist pen paper , artist priyam pradhan present privat life , showcas current signific life depict abstract form.at centr paint 1000-rupe note , within pradhan intric paint lord krishna , man wear hoodi tenderli embrac dog , woman .', 'woman stand tall , elong form .', 'toward bottom canva , holi man reach hand , appear flight.priyam pradhan use vibrant colour palett , incorpor bright hue pink , orang , yellow , well green , black , white , grey .', 'combin add dynam live qualiti artwork . “ man centr girl green girlfriend .', 'face mom dad , ” say pradhan .', '“ sadhu ( holi man ) symbolis desir ’ mani desir materialist thing howev understand valu money . ” use colour , figur line abstract form paint resembl paint american painter paul jackson pollock .', 'like abstract expression , pradhan express painting.furthermor , mark priyam pradhan ’ third solo paint exhibit titl mani ( money ) , inaugur januari 17 siddhartha art galleri , baber mahal.in previou exhibit , pradhan ’ artwork centr around hindu philosophi spontan thought process .', 'howev , latest exhibit , explor theme money impact individu ’ life , delv reverber effect financi aspects.understand valu moneypaint artist priyam pradhan siddhartha art galleri , baber mahal .', 'photo : chandra bahadur aleani form art known reflect contemporari time .', 'likewis , priyam pradhan ’ paint reflect lifestyl , desir , oblig today ’ younger gener live urban area nepal.pradhan 20 justifi want youngster 20 , might declar adult understand need money materialist thing still kid heart want explor experi life much possible.th exhibit 27 paint pradhan took around nine month complet .', 'accord , travel idea life luxuri capabl explor anyth want money.and artist concept linger compel creat theme money.onc enter galleri , also view anim video , introduc artist pradhan import money , ground floor .', 'first floor , huge paint ( 193×62 cm ) apatkalin awastha use mix media canva welcom paint small size ( 18×30 cm ) . “ team work introduct artist exhibit , ” say .', '“ also , recent multimedia graduat islington colleg , want explor skill got team .', ', like money , multimedia relev current societi . ” experienc life artpaint artist priyam pradhan siddhartha art galleri , baber mahal .', 'photo : chandra bahadur ale priyam pradhan say enjoy mean life enjoy creat artwork .', 'moreov , pradhan came art world first tattoo artist feel bless privileg explor whatev like life.h also believ philosophi say one materialist wrong .', '“ materi thing import , would one build hous ?', 'build hous want decor hous ? ” questions.alongsid , money materialist thing , paint also explor love , romanc , life childhood experi .', 'motif like pokemon , ramen noodl , anim , dancer , etc use paint .', 'paint , use numer white line wavi form line pradhan indic sound energi exist surround time.about use pitta artist pen , say , “ enjoy draw paint sinc childhood use pitta artist pen help revisit feel happi sens freedom . ” mani thing happen canva use vibrant colour give sens excit viewer .', 'though referenc artist like pollock , mf husain , picasso , pen stroke give sens new express thought life experiences.in paint , bright colour motif harmoni visual treat sure cheer mood visitor .', 'moreov , also get free sticker artist.if gloomi mood want uplift littl , visit exhibit continu till februari 6 .']"
Posts navigation,"Entrepreneurship education is not just an investment in the education system; it is an investment in the nation’s future prosperity. Photo: Pexels/ Rodnae ProductionsIn the shadow of the towering Himalayas, Nepal faces a challenge that rivals the steepness of its mountainous terrain- the challenge of economic development. As the nation earnestly pursues its Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), it becomes increasingly evident that a transformation in the education system is not only necessary but also urgent. Rooted in common living strategies, the prevailing education model, especially in higher education, may not adequately prepare the youth for the demands of the modern world. In this critical juncture, the incorporation of entrepreneurship education emerges as a beacon of hope, offering a pathway towards a self-reliant and prosperous Nepal.Time to reevaluate the education systemNepal’s journey towards economic prosperity has been marked by challenges that demand innovative solutions. The commitment of the SDGs reflects not only a global responsibility but also a domestic imperative for sustainable development. For this, it is high time to reevaluate the education system in the country.The current education system in Nepal, deeply entrenched in common living strategies, has been the foundation of learning for generations. However, in the face of a rapidly evolving world, today’s generation aspires for more than the status quo. The call for independence reverberates through the aspirations of youth who seek a curriculum fostering critical thinking, innovation and entrepreneurial skills.Entrepreneurship education is a dynamic force capable of reshaping Nepal’s educational landscape. This innovative approach moves beyond traditional learning methods, providing students with the tools to navigate the complexities of the modern world. At its core, entrepreneurship education is about empowering students to implement learned information in practical and tangible ways.Consider a student engrossed in the intricacies of sensor systems during a science class, entrepreneurship education transforms this theoretical knowledge into practical applications, inspiring the creation of a sensor-operated door. Such innovation born from a fusion of science and entrepreneurship becomes a valuable mindset in solving practical problems.  Expanding the horizons of entrepreneurship education, let us delve into chemistry. Imagine students studying chemistry not just as a theoretical subject, but also as entrepreneurs in the making. Armed with entrepreneurial principles, these students can tap into Nepal’s rich biodiversity, exploring market demands for products derived from local plants.In the scenario, chemistry students could embark on a journey to develop performance-enhancing products based on market demand, harnessing the potential of indigenous flora. What makes this approach remarkable is that it does not necessarily require sophisticated machines or extensive human resources. Instead, it leverages the inherent skills and awareness of individuals within the community, paving the way for a grassroots economic revolution.Entrepreneurship in education Representational graphic. Image: FreepikThe beauty of entrepreneurship education lies in its universal applicability. It is not confined to science or chemistry alone. Consider an art student, for example. Through entrepreneurship education, they can understand what art to develop (product), how much to set the price (price), where to sell (place) and how to sell (promote) their artworks. Every subject becomes a canvas for innovation and enterprise.Moreover, entrepreneurship education is a powerful equaliser, recognising the unique skills and talents of individuals across various disciplines. It is not about fitting into a predefined mould but rather about unleashing the potential within each student. When every single person is aware of their skills and potential, they can rise to different levels, contributing to the overall progress of the nation.Entrepreneurship education goes beyond skill recognition; it is about nurturing the ability to produce goods and mastering the art of marketing. Returning to the example of the student developing a sensor-operated door, entrepreneurship education not only equips them to produce the product but also teaches them how to navigate the complexities of marketing it to potential users and clients.The impact of entrepreneurship education extends beyond individual success stories; it reverberates through the entire nation. A generation equipped with entrepreneurial skills becomes a driving force for economic growth and independence. They will be able to recognise the resources and ideas to utilise them to reach the global market. They will be able to be the pioneers in products and contribute to the economy. By fostering a culture of innovation, creativity and self-reliance, Nepal can reduce its dependence on external sources and strengthen its economy from within.In essence, entrepreneurship education is not just an investment in the education system; it is an investment in the nation’s future prosperity. It is a transformative force that has the potential to shape a generation of independent thinkers, innovators and entrepreneurs- the architects of a self-reliant and economically vibrant Nepal. Entrepreneurship education, by teaching students to utilise available resources (physical and financial) and make them commercial, becomes a cornerstone in the nation’s journey towards economic empowerment and independence.",['post navig'],"['entrepreneurship educ invest educ system ; invest nation ’ futur prosper .', 'photo : pexels/ rodna productionsin shadow tower himalaya , nepal face challeng rival steep mountain terrain- challeng econom develop .', 'nation earnestli pursu sustain develop goal ( sdg ) , becom increasingli evid transform educ system necessari also urgent .', 'root common live strategi , prevail educ model , especi higher educ , may adequ prepar youth demand modern world .', 'critic junctur , incorpor entrepreneurship educ emerg beacon hope , offer pathway toward self-reli prosper nepal.tim reevalu educ systemnep ’ journey toward econom prosper mark challeng demand innov solut .', 'commit sdg reflect global respons also domest imper sustain develop .', ', high time reevalu educ system country.th current educ system nepal , deepli entrench common live strategi , foundat learn gener .', 'howev , face rapidli evolv world , today ’ gener aspir statu quo .', 'call independ reverber aspir youth seek curriculum foster critic think , innov entrepreneuri skills.entrepreneurship educ dynam forc capabl reshap nepal ’ educ landscap .', 'innov approach move beyond tradit learn method , provid student tool navig complex modern world .', 'core , entrepreneurship educ empow student implement learn inform practic tangibl ways.consid student engross intricaci sensor system scienc class , entrepreneurship educ transform theoret knowledg practic applic , inspir creation sensor-oper door .', 'innov born fusion scienc entrepreneurship becom valuabl mindset solv practic problem .', 'expand horizon entrepreneurship educ , let us delv chemistri .', 'imagin student studi chemistri theoret subject , also entrepreneur make .', 'arm entrepreneuri principl , student tap nepal ’ rich biodivers , explor market demand product deriv local plants.in scenario , chemistri student could embark journey develop performance-enhanc product base market demand , har potenti indigen flora .', 'make approach remark necessarili requir sophist machin extens human resourc .', 'instead , leverag inher skill awar individu within commun , pave way grassroot econom revolution.entrepreneurship educ represent graphic .', 'imag : freepikth beauti entrepreneurship educ lie univers applic .', 'confin scienc chemistri alon .', 'consid art student , exampl .', 'entrepreneurship educ , understand art develop ( product ) , much set price ( price ) , sell ( place ) sell ( promot ) artwork .', 'everi subject becom canva innov enterprise.moreov , entrepreneurship educ power equalis , recognis uniqu skill talent individu across variou disciplin .', 'fit predefin mould rather unleash potenti within student .', 'everi singl person awar skill potenti , rise differ level , contribut overal progress nation.entrepreneurship educ goe beyond skill recognit ; nurtur abil produc good master art market .', 'return exampl student develop sensor-oper door , entrepreneurship educ equip produc product also teach navig complex market potenti user clients.th impact entrepreneurship educ extend beyond individu success stori ; reverber entir nation .', 'gener equip entrepreneuri skill becom drive forc econom growth independ .', 'abl recognis resourc idea utilis reach global market .', 'abl pioneer product contribut economi .', 'foster cultur innov , creativ self-reli , nepal reduc depend extern sourc strengthen economi within.in essenc , entrepreneurship educ invest educ system ; invest nation ’ futur prosper .', 'transform forc potenti shape gener independ thinker , innov entrepreneurs- architect self-reli econom vibrant nepal .', 'entrepreneurship educ , teach student utilis avail resourc ( physic financi ) make commerci , becom cornerston nation ’ journey toward econom empower independ .']"

Role of entrepreneurship education in Nepal’s quest for economic empowerment ,"Ram Bujhaun Yadav with his land ownership certificate stands near a border pillar which he says was erroneously placed on his land. In October 2023, when 51-year-old Ram Bujhaun Yadav of Musaharnia Rural Municipality-5, Mukhiyapatti, Dhanusha, was at a relative’s house, someone told him that two Indian Sashastra Seema Bal (SSB) personnel were looking for him.Anxious, he rushed home wondering why they were looking for him.“They asked me if the paddy field in the no man’s land was mine. I told them yes and they asked me to cut down the paddy immediately,” he said.The paddy was not ripe and Yadav asked them for some time. However, the SSB personnel told him he had to cut down his paddy immediately.Ram Bujhaun and his wife Tetari Devi each own a 677-square-metre plot of land. As Nepal and India reevaluated the border, Ram Bujhan’s land was been deemed to be near the no man’s land as it now has two demarcation pillars.Frustrated, Ram Bujhaun cut the paddy before it was due to be harvested. Now, he has been asked to not plant anything on the land as it falls in the no man’s land.“Our border police don’t say a word. I can’t fight the SSB on my own,” says Ram Bujhaun adding he had decided not to plan anything on the land anymore.Woes of the farmersMany farmers in southern Nepal say their land has now been placed in India after the recent demarcation. When the Jamuna River, which flows through the no man’s land between Nepal and India, changed its course some two decades ago, some border pillars went missing. Locals say these pillars have now been placed encroaching on Nepali land.In 2018, with the then Chief District Officer of Dhanusha, Pradeep Raj Kandel, and an official from Madhubani district, Bihar, India, a team that included border security forces from both countries, the Armed Police Force of Nepal, and SSB of India began placing border pillars after land measurement by technicians.Locals have raised concerns, stating that border pillars have been positioned, encroaching approximately 50 to 100 meters of land into Nepal compared to the previous position. Many like Ram Bujhaun are unaware of when these border pillars were placed.“I did not know that pillar was placed here. After I found out when I asked the village leaders, many said they were placing the border pillars as they pleased,” said Ram Bujhaun.He was told to carry on planting paddy and that it would not matter as these issues had happened in the past. “They encroached on my land and have asked me not to plant anything. This is gross injustice,” he says.Ram Bujhaun’s family owns a total of 4,000 square metres of land, with 2,000 square metres belonging to him and the remaining 2,000 square metres to his brother Bechan. However, 1,000 square metres of his land is now located on the Indian side after the demarcation. Despite this, he has been farming on the land and continues to pay taxes to the Department of Land Management and Archive in Nepal.“They have marked my land to be on the Indian side and placed border pillars on it. I’ve been farming till now but I don’t know when they will ask me to stop,” he says.Ignorance of the governmentThe Madhesh province in southern NepalThe former ward chair of Mukhiyapatti Musharniya Rural Municipality-5, Ram Naresh Yadav, said that over time, India has encroached on numerous Nepali lands in various locations in the Madhesh Province. This, he says, happened due to the Nepali administration’s ignorance and weak stature.“They (Nepali administration) were careless and that meant the Indian side placed these border pillars by encroaching on Nepali land,” says Ram Naresh.He said that over 40 farmers from wards 1, 5, and 6 have land ranging from 300 to 1,600 square metres on the Indian side. “These farmers have land ownership certificates, but they cannot farm as the SSB says the land is in India and not Nepal,” said Ram Naresh.In 1996, land ownership certificates were distributed after surveying the land in the border area. Local Dharmendra Kumar Yadav said that since then, the locals have been paying their land tax regularly. In 2018, when the pillar was being placed, the locals protested when they saw their land was being encroached on. However, since the demarcation had been agreed upon by high-ranking government officials of Nepal and India, the farmer’s voices went unheard.“We tried to stop when the border pillars were being placed on our land. But the administrators from both sides forcibly put it there without even trying to hold a discussion,” said Harish Chandra Yadav. The Chief District Officer of Dhanusha, Chakrapani Pandey, says that the border pillars were placed by the technical team after the measurements and with the agreement of the high-ranking officials of the two countries.“The fields and houses that are built in no man’s land have recently been cleared. No one can do anything in this particular area,” said Pandey. “We understand the people’s concern but we cannot do anything about it now.”",['role entrepreneurship educ nepal ’ quest econom empower'],"['ram bujhaun yadav land ownership certif stand near border pillar say erron place land .', 'octob 2023 , 51-year-old ram bujhaun yadav musaharnia rural municipality-5 , mukhiyapatti , dhanusha , rel ’ hous , someon told two indian sashastra seema bal ( ssb ) personnel look him.anxi , rush home wonder look him . “ ask paddi field man ’ land mine .', 'told ye ask cut paddi immedi , ” said.th paddi ripe yadav ask time .', 'howev , ssb personnel told cut paddi immediately.ram bujhaun wife tetari devi 677-square-metr plot land .', 'nepal india reevalu border , ram bujhan ’ land deem near man ’ land two demarc pillars.frustr , ram bujhaun cut paddi due harvest .', ', ask plant anyth land fall man ’ land . “ border polic ’ say word .', '’ fight ssb , ” say ram bujhaun ad decid plan anyth land anymore.wo farmersmani farmer southern nepal say land place india recent demarc .', 'jamuna river , flow man ’ land nepal india , chang cours two decad ago , border pillar went miss .', 'local say pillar place encroach nepali land.in 2018 , chief district offic dhanusha , pradeep raj kandel , offici madhubani district , bihar , india , team includ border secur forc countri , arm polic forc nepal , ssb india began place border pillar land measur technicians.loc rais concern , state border pillar posit , encroach approxim 50 100 meter land nepal compar previou posit .', 'mani like ram bujhaun unawar border pillar place . “ know pillar place .', 'found ask villag leader , mani said place border pillar pleas , ” said ram bujhaun.h told carri plant paddi would matter issu happen past .', '“ encroach land ask plant anyth .', 'gross injustic , ” says.ram bujhaun ’ famili own total 4,000 squar metr land , 2,000 squar metr belong remain 2,000 squar metr brother bechan .', 'howev , 1,000 squar metr land locat indian side demarc .', 'despit , farm land continu pay tax depart land manag archiv nepal . “ mark land indian side place border pillar .', '’ farm till ’ know ask stop , ” says.ignor governmentth madhesh provinc southern nepalth former ward chair mukhiyapatti musharniya rural municipality-5 , ram naresh yadav , said time , india encroach numer nepali land variou locat madhesh provinc .', ', say , happen due nepali administr ’ ignor weak statur . “ ( nepali administr ) careless meant indian side place border pillar encroach nepali land , ” say ram naresh.h said 40 farmer ward 1 , 5 , 6 land rang 300 1,600 squar metr indian side .', '“ farmer land ownership certif , farm ssb say land india nepal , ” said ram naresh.in 1996 , land ownership certif distribut survey land border area .', 'local dharmendra kumar yadav said sinc , local pay land tax regularli .', '2018 , pillar place , local protest saw land encroach .', 'howev , sinc demarc agre upon high-rank govern offici nepal india , farmer ’ voic went unheard . “ tri stop border pillar place land .', 'administr side forcibl put without even tri hold discuss , ” said harish chandra yadav .', 'chief district offic dhanusha , chakrapani pandey , say border pillar place technic team measur agreement high-rank offici two countri . “ field hous built man ’ land recent clear .', 'one anyth particular area , ” said pandey .', '“ understand peopl ’ concern anyth . ”']"
National Assembly election taking place today ,"Regenerative braking representational image. Photo: FreepikThe electric vehicle market in Nepal has grown significantly over the past year. Electric four-wheelers and two-wheelers are being launched almost every month, spanning from passenger to commercial vehicles. Electric transportation appears to be an emerging trend in the automotive industry.New EVs are regularly introduced with advanced features as car companies develop unique electric platforms. One standout feature is regenerative braking.Regenerative braking was first introduced in 1967 by the American Motor Car Company (AMC) in their prototype electric vehicle, the AMC Amitron. However, Toyota became the automobile manufacturer to implement regenerative braking system (RBS) technology in their Prius series hybrid vehicles in 1997. Toyota brought up the new hybrid technology in the Prius when fuel prices were going up at a massive rate. 1997 Toyota Prius Hybrid. Photo: ToyotaBut what is regenerative braking? There are still many people confused about what it is, whether it is safe or helpful in fuel economy in hybrid cars and the regeneration of electricity in electric cars.In simple terms, regen braking is when a car saves energy by recharging its battery when you brake, helping it use less fuel or electricity and go further. Easy but scientifically, regen braking is a process used in vehicles where the kinetic energy produced during braking is converted into electrical energy through an electric motor acting as a generator. This electrical energy is then stored in the vehicle’s battery for later use, reducing energy wastage and increasing overall efficiency.Photo: FreepikRegen braking can be seen in all kinds of EVs, including cars, scooters, commercial vans, buses, bicycles, three-wheelers, and rickshaws. It now can be electrically managed to what extent the power and braking can be generated. Regenerative Braking work process in EVPrinciple of Operation: Regene braking works by turning the energy from slowing down into electricity.Electric Motor as a Generator: In EV or hybrid cars with regen braking, the motor changes roles from moving the car to making electricity when you brake.Switching Polarity: When you brake, the motor switches directions, turning energy from the wheels into electricity instead of using it to move the car.Generation of Electricity: The turning wheels make the motor produce electricity, which goes to the car’s battery.Power Electronics: Special electronics change the electricity from the motor into the right kind for charging the battery.Battery Charging: The electricity made during braking charges up the car’s battery, storing the energy for later.Integration with Hydraulic Braking System: Regenerative braking works with the regular brakes, blending them for smooth stopping.Photo: automotive-iqAdvantages and Disadvantages of Regenerative Braking The advantages are listed below:Energy Efficiency: Regenerative braking efficiently captures the kinetic energy generated during braking, effectively reducing energy wastage and contributing to a more sustainable driving experience.Extended Range: By using the energy that would otherwise be lost during braking as heat and sound, regenerative braking helps to extend the driving range of electric vehicles in instances such as travelling downhill. Reduced Brake Wear: Regenerative braking minimizes the strain on traditional braking components, mitigating wear and tear, and potentially extending the lifespan of the braking components such as brake pads, rotors and brake lines, thus reducing maintenance costs over time.Enhanced Driving Experience: Regenerative braking provides a smoother braking experience and a more responsive feel to drivers, enhancing overall driving comfort and control on the road.The disadvantages are listed below:Limited Effectiveness at Low Speeds: While regenerative braking efficiently recaptures energy during braking, its effectiveness diminishes at lower speeds which leads to decreased energy recovery compared to higher speeds.Complexity and Cost: Implementing regenerative braking adds complexity and cost to vehicle systems, potentially raising manufacturing and maintenance expenses, and impacting consumer affordability.Maintenance Requirements: Regenerative braking systems require periodic maintenance and calibration to ensure they operate optimally.Efficiency Variability: Regenerative braking may exhibit variability in efficiency under extreme weather conditions or on certain road surfaces, leading to fluctuations in overall energy recapture and impacting the vehicle’s efficiency.MisconceptionsFully Recharges Battery: Some mistakenly believe that regenerative braking fully replenishes the battery, but in reality, it only adds a modest amount of charge.Increases Braking Distances: There is a misconception that regenerative braking extends braking distances, but it enhances braking performance by complementing traditional brakes.High-Speed Only: While more effective at higher speeds, regenerative braking still functions at lower speeds, such as during city driving or stop-and-go traffic.Maintenance-Free: Despite requiring less maintenance than traditional brakes, regen braking systems still need periodic checks and maintenance to ensure proper operation.Significantly Boosts Range: While regen braking contributes to extending the driving range of electric vehicles, its impact is influenced by various factors beyond just braking efficiency.Only for Electric Cars: Although commonly associated with electric vehicles, regen braking systems are also found in some conventional vehicles, particularly those aiming to improve fuel efficiency with advanced technology.Photo: FreepikRegenerative braking might sound complicated, but it is pretty cool. Think of it as a way for EVs and hybrids to recycle energy when they slow down. Instead of just wasting that energy, regenerative braking turns it into electricity, which can then be used to power the battery.",['nation assembl elect take place today'],"['regen brake represent imag .', 'photo : freepikth electr vehicl market nepal grown significantli past year .', 'electr four-wheel two-wheel launch almost everi month , span passeng commerci vehicl .', 'electr transport appear emerg trend automot industry.new ev regularli introduc advanc featur car compani develop uniqu electr platform .', 'one standout featur regen braking.regen brake first introduc 1967 american motor car compani ( amc ) prototyp electr vehicl , amc amitron .', 'howev , toyota becam automobil manufactur implement regen brake system ( rb ) technolog priu seri hybrid vehicl 1997 .', 'toyota brought new hybrid technolog priu fuel price go massiv rate .', '1997 toyota priu hybrid .', 'photo : toyotabut regen brake ?', 'still mani peopl confus , whether safe help fuel economi hybrid car regener electr electr cars.in simpl term , regen brake car save energi recharg batteri brake , help use less fuel electr go .', 'easi scientif , regen brake process use vehicl kinet energi produc brake convert electr energi electr motor act gener .', 'electr energi store vehicl ’ batteri later use , reduc energi wastag increas overal efficiency.photo : freepikregen brake seen kind ev , includ car , scooter , commerci van , buse , bicycl , three-wheel , rickshaw .', 'electr manag extent power brake gener .', 'regen brake work process evprincipl oper : regen brake work turn energi slow electricity.electr motor gener : ev hybrid car regen brake , motor chang role move car make electr brake.switch polar : brake , motor switch direct , turn energi wheel electr instead use move car.gener electr : turn wheel make motor produc electr , goe car ’ battery.pow electron : special electron chang electr motor right kind charg battery.batteri charg : electr made brake charg car ’ batteri , store energi later.integr hydraul brake system : regen brake work regular brake , blend smooth stopping.photo : automotive-iqadvantag disadvantag regen brake advantag list : energi effici : regen brake effici captur kinet energi gener brake , effect reduc energi wastag contribut sustain drive experience.extend rang : use energi would otherwis lost brake heat sound , regen brake help extend drive rang electr vehicl instanc travel downhil .', 'reduc brake wear : regen brake minim strain tradit brake compon , mitig wear tear , potenti extend lifespan brake compon brake pad , rotor brake line , thu reduc mainten cost time.enhanc drive experi : regen brake provid smoother brake experi respons feel driver , enhanc overal drive comfort control road.th disadvantag list : limit effect low speed : regen brake effici recaptur energi brake , effect diminish lower speed lead decreas energi recoveri compar higher speeds.complex cost : implement regen brake add complex cost vehicl system , potenti rais manufactur mainten expens , impact consum affordability.mainten requir : regen brake system requir period mainten calibr ensur oper optimally.effici variabl : regen brake may exhibit variabl effici extrem weather condit certain road surfac , lead fluctuat overal energi recaptur impact vehicl ’ efficiency.misconceptions recharg batteri : mistakenli believ regen brake fulli replenish batteri , realiti , add modest amount charge.increas brake distanc : misconcept regen brake extend brake distanc , enhanc brake perform complement tradit brakes.high-spe : effect higher speed , regen brake still function lower speed , citi drive stop-and-go traffic.maintenance-fre : despit requir less mainten tradit brake , regen brake system still need period check mainten ensur proper operation.significantli boost rang : regen brake contribut extend drive rang electr vehicl , impact influenc variou factor beyond brake efficiency.onli electr car : although commonli associ electr vehicl , regen brake system also found convent vehicl , particularli aim improv fuel effici advanc technology.photo : freepikregen brake might sound complic , pretti cool .', 'think way ev hybrid recycl energi slow .', 'instead wast energi , regen brake turn electr , use power batteri .']"
Santoshi Shrestha wins gold on marathon debut ,"The snow leopard rescued from Urlabari is currently being kept at the Central Zoo in Lalitpur. Photo: Aryan DhimalAs the gates to the vet clinic at the Central Zoo in Lalitpur opened, more than two dozen photojournalists thronged the facility and surrounded a metal cage aiming their DSLR cameras at a snow leopard inside.“Please don’t come close to the animal,” the zoo’s vet, Radha Krishna Gharti, told approaching photojournalists. But in the gush of excitement to take exclusive photographs of the elusive cat, difficult to spot even in its prime habitats, there were few takers for the word of caution.Nepal’s Department of National Parks and Wildlife Conservation (DNPWC) organised the photo-op two days after the male subadult cat, which was until recently found in the country only at altitudes higher than 2,000-6,000 metres above sea level, was brought to the zoo from Urlabari town(146 m above sea level). According to the department, the animal has sustained injuries to its right foreleg and cannot stand upright.Although officials involved said they are looking at releasing the animal into the wild after it recuperates, doing so will be a daunting task, adding that the zoo may be the only place where it can now survive.Not a wild catReporters and photojournalists take photos of a snow leopard being held at the Central Zoo in Lalitpur, Nepal. Image by Abhaya Raj Joshi/ Mongabay“Nepali snow leopard experts have come up with two hypotheses to explain how the animal from the mountains landed up in the plains,” said Sharad Chandra Adhikari, member-secretary at the National Trust for Nature Conservation (NTNC), a semi-government body that manages the zoo in Lalitpur, a town in the Kathmandu Valley. The first of the two hypotheses made public during the photo-op-cum-press conference, is that it was raised in captivity and somehow managed to escape into the wild. The second is that it lost its orientation while trying to establish its territory after separating from its mother.Kulbhushansingh Suryawanshi, director of the India program, Snow Leopard Trust, said that both hypotheses are plausible explanations as to how the snow leopard got to the plains in Nepal.A DNPWC official, who wished to remain anonymous as he is not authorised to talk to the press, said that it was more likely that the animal had been raised in captivity. “The way it sipped the water and ate the food zoo staff offered indicates that it may have been raised in captivity,” the official said.Snow leopards are shy cats living at extreme altitudes in the steep mountainous areas of 12 countries in Central and South Asia. Their global population spread over altitudes of 500-5,800 m, is estimated to be between around 3,900 and 6,000 as detailed coordinated surveys of the population in the range countries are yet to be carried out. In Nepal, their population divided into three blocks (eastern, central and western) is estimated to be between 301 and 400.Adhikari from NTNC said that researchers will now examine the animal’s scat to analyse its diet and try to find out whether it was roaming in the wild or had been in some sort of captivity. Researchers are also preparing to analyse its genes to try to find out to which of the three metapopulations in Nepal it belongs. They will also observe the animal’s canine teeth and fur to look for clues.Relocation challenge A snow leopard found in Urlabari town in Nepal’s plains in a cage at the Central Zoo in Kathmandu. Photo: Aryan DhimalThe whole process could take a few months to complete, and summer could set in in Kathmandu by then, officials concede. “The current temperature in Kathmandu is suitable for snow leopards, as we are in the peak of winter,” said Madhu Chetri, a snow leopard researcher from NTNC. But that could change as spring season begins in the Northern Hemisphere.The DNPWC official said that regardless of the findings related to how the animal got to Urlabarli, the animal would have spent a significant amount of time with humans during its recovery phase. “That would mean that it would have gotten habituated with having humans around,” the official said.Sending such animals back into the wild is a challenge, as they may have lost their hunting and other adaptation skills, he added. In May last year, officials at the Chitwan National Park released two rescued rhino calves into the wild, with limited success. The safety of the animals, which had gotten used to having humans around, was compromised as poachers could easily approach and kill them. Eventually, they were transferred to an enclosure in eastern Nepal away from human intervention.Veteran conservationist Professor Karan Bahadur Shah said that rewilding the snow leopard would be a daunting task, as the animals are territorial. “If we just leave the animal in its natural habitat, it will get killed by other snow leopards defending their territory,” he said. “The best option would be to keep the animal in the zoo for the public to see.”But Nepal’s Central Zoo has its own set of problems. The facility, established in 1932 as a private collection, has limited space and has frequently run into financial trouble. Conservationists say the snow leopard would need special facilities to cater to its needs.“If the government decides that the snow leopard needs to remain at the zoo, we are ready to shoulder the responsibility,” said Adhikari. “We have set up special facilities for animals such as the red panda and chimpanzees,” he said. “We can do that for the snow leopard as well.”Those advocating for keeping the animal in the zoo also said that Nepal is a snow leopard range country and the public, especially the young generation, also needs to see the different animals found in the country. “It has great educational value,” said Shah.Snow leopard expert Suryawanshi from neighbouring India also said that it would be challenging to release the animal into the wild. “If the team at the zoo can establish the exact cause of this behaviour [why it ventured into the plains] and can keep the animal away from human contact, then it might be okay to release it back,” he said. “But otherwise, there is little hope for it in the wild. Better to let it live in the zoo.”Back at the zoo, after the photojournalists are done taking photos, it is the turn of the reporters to point their smartphones at the animal. Then there is a contingent of senior wildlife department officials waiting in line to catch a glimpse of the animal. “So much for keeping it away from human contact,” a conservationist observing the hullabaloo from a distance said.This story first appeared on Mongabay and Onlinekhabar is republishing it under a Creative Commons licence.",['santoshi shrestha win gold marathon debut'],"['snow leopard rescu urlabari current kept central zoo lalitpur .', 'photo : aryan dhimala gate vet clinic central zoo lalitpur open , two dozen photojournalist throng facil surround metal cage aim dslr camera snow leopard insid . “ pleas ’ come close anim , ” zoo ’ vet , radha krishna gharti , told approach photojournalist .', 'gush excit take exclus photograph elus cat , difficult spot even prime habitat , taker word caution.nep ’ depart nation park wildlif conserv ( dnpwc ) organis photo-op two day male subadult cat , recent found countri altitud higher 2,000-6,000 metr sea level , brought zoo urlabari town ( 146 sea level ) .', 'accord depart , anim sustain injuri right foreleg stand upright.although offici involv said look releas anim wild recuper , daunt task , ad zoo may place survive.not wild catreport photojournalist take photo snow leopard held central zoo lalitpur , nepal .', 'imag abhaya raj joshi/ mongabay “ nepali snow leopard expert come two hypothes explain anim mountain land plain , ” said sharad chandra adhikari , member-secretari nation trust natur conserv ( ntnc ) , semi-govern bodi manag zoo lalitpur , town kathmandu valley .', 'first two hypothes made public photo-op-cum-press confer , rais captiv somehow manag escap wild .', 'second lost orient tri establish territori separ mother.kulbhushansingh suryawanshi , director india program , snow leopard trust , said hypothes plausibl explan snow leopard got plain nepal.a dnpwc offici , wish remain anonym authoris talk press , said like anim rais captiv .', '“ way sip water ate food zoo staff offer indic may rais captiv , ” offici said.snow leopard shi cat live extrem altitud steep mountain area 12 countri central south asia .', 'global popul spread altitud 500-5,800 , estim around 3,900 6,000 detail coordin survey popul rang countri yet carri .', 'nepal , popul divid three block ( eastern , central western ) estim 301 400.adhikari ntnc said research examin anim ’ scat analys diet tri find whether roam wild sort captiv .', 'research also prepar analys gene tri find three metapopul nepal belong .', 'also observ anim ’ canin teeth fur look clues.reloc challeng snow leopard found urlabari town nepal ’ plain cage central zoo kathmandu .', 'photo : aryan dhimalth whole process could take month complet , summer could set kathmandu , offici conced .', '“ current temperatur kathmandu suitabl snow leopard , peak winter , ” said madhu chetri , snow leopard research ntnc .', 'could chang spring season begin northern hemisphere.th dnpwc offici said regardless find relat anim got urlabarli , anim would spent signific amount time human recoveri phase .', '“ would mean would gotten habitu human around , ” offici said.send anim back wild challeng , may lost hunt adapt skill , ad .', 'may last year , offici chitwan nation park releas two rescu rhino calv wild , limit success .', 'safeti anim , gotten use human around , compromis poacher could easili approach kill .', 'eventu , transfer enclosur eastern nepal away human intervention.veteran conservationist professor karan bahadur shah said rewild snow leopard would daunt task , anim territori .', '“ leav anim natur habitat , get kill snow leopard defend territori , ” said .', '“ best option would keep anim zoo public see . ” nepal ’ central zoo set problem .', 'facil , establish 1932 privat collect , limit space frequent run financi troubl .', 'conservationist say snow leopard would need special facil cater need . “ govern decid snow leopard need remain zoo , readi shoulder respons , ” said adhikari .', '“ set special facil anim red panda chimpanze , ” said .', '“ snow leopard well . ” advoc keep anim zoo also said nepal snow leopard rang countri public , especi young gener , also need see differ anim found countri .', '“ great educ valu , ” said shah.snow leopard expert suryawanshi neighbour india also said would challeng releas anim wild .', '“ team zoo establish exact caus behaviour [ ventur plain ] keep anim away human contact , might okay releas back , ” said .', '“ otherwis , littl hope wild .', 'better let live zoo . ” back zoo , photojournalist done take photo , turn report point smartphon anim .', 'conting senior wildlif depart offici wait line catch glimps anim .', '“ much keep away human contact , ” conservationist observ hullabaloo distanc said.thi stori first appear mongabay onlinekhabar republish creativ common licenc .']"
Erroneous border pillar placement plagues Nepali farmers in Madhesh ,"The National Assembly was formed to give experienced people a chance to be part of the parliament and help during the formation of important bills. In countries that follow the Westminster model of government, the upper house plays an important role. That, however, is not the case in Nepal as the country’s upper house has become a platform where individuals secure positions in the National Assembly based on their connections. As the election nears, many once again question the relevance and existence of the upper house.Things were different in the past as the initial years of the National Assembly saw experienced politicians and experts others in their field be nominated for the post. That slowly changed as the first batch completed its two-year term.“I understand why people are frustrated with the upper house. People expected experts but all we got was party cadres who lacked knowledge or experience,” says Bimala Rai Paudyal a National Assembly member. “Considering such behaviour and practices, what distinguishes the House of Representatives from the National Assembly?”A loser’s second chance Narayan Kaji Shrestha, who faced defeat in the 2017 general election from Gorkha-2, was elected as a member of the National Assembly on January 23, 2020. Elected from Gandaki Province, Shrestha currently is the Deputy Prime Minister and Home Minister of the country.Bhagwati Neupane who lost the election from Gandaki province and Bimala Ghimire who lost the election for mayorship in Bhanu Municipality also shared the same trajectory.Similarly, Mrigendra Kumar Singh Yadav and Jag Prasad Sharma were defeated in the House of Representatives elections, from Saptari-4 and Dang-3 respectively are now members of the National Assembly. Bam Dev Gautam, who lost the elections from Bardiya, secured a place in the upper house through nomination by President Bidya Devi Bhandari.Even those who did not win as ward member(s) got the opportunity to become members of the National Assembly including Sindh Bahadur Bishwakarma who was appointed on February 7, 2018. He is soon leaving his post on March 3.Despite the repeated criticisms, the political parties have not paid attention to this concern posed by political leaders and the general public. The latest proof of this is the list of candidates for the National Assembly elections scheduled on January 25. The list contains names like Krishna Prasad Sitaula, defeated in the House of Representatives elections in 2022 from Koshi Province, and Pooja Chaudhary, who lost in the provincial assembly elections 2022 from Rautahat-3 (a).Speaker Ganesh Prasad Timilsina, who led the National Assembly for the entire six years under the federal system, is also dissatisfied with the individuals who have made it to the upper house. “The allegations are something for the parties to ponder upon. The leaders should have prioritised involving intellectuals/neutrals rather than managing its members,” he says.The 59-member National Assembly elects eight representatives, equally from all seven provinces, with an additional three individuals nominated by the President. The Constitution ensures representation of women, Dalits, minorities or disabled communities, envisioning that experts, experienced individuals, and the most qualified people from various fields will become members of the National Assembly.Easy way inFile: A National Assembly meetingThere are some reasons why leaders aspire to join the upper house, and even the leadership create opportunities for them. In National Assembly elections, voters consist of local-level heads/deputy heads and provincial assembly members. Typically, individuals seeking these positions undergo a vetting process by their respective parties. As a result, aspiring members of parliament can focus less on persuading individual voters and more on gaining party support to secure their candidacy. Moreover, being a member of the National Assembly opens avenues to ministerial roles. The constitution prohibits a National Assembly member from becoming the Prime Minister, but not Deputy Prime Minister. Due to such opportunities, leaders are enticed to seek a position in the assembly.The National Assembly is currently in its fourth election cycle since the promulgation of the Consitution in 2015. Scheduled for January 25, this election aims to fill 19 seats vacated by individuals completing their six-year terms. The previous election cycles took place in 2017, involving 56 members, followed by 2019 with 18 positions, and 2020 with 19 positions.The cascading impactsFile: A National Assembly meetingAnother reason why the National Assembly is finding it difficult to justify itself is that it has become a shadow of the House of Representatives. The meeting of the National Assembly did not have one session when the House of Representatives was dissolved by then Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli twice. The demands and issues raised by the opposition parties in the House of Representatives automatically went to the National Assembly, where the parliamentarians of the ruling party put forward any proposal, they endorse it the same as in the House of Representatives.The latest example – is the main opposition UML did not allow the meeting of the House of Representatives to continue for five days from July 5, 2023, due to a statement made by Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal during his visit to India. Consequently, the meeting of the National Assembly was also paused during that period.The UML obstructed the House of Representatives for almost a month starting mid-July last year demanding a high-level inquiry committee to probe the 60-kilogram gold smuggling case and the resignation of the Home Minister. The National Assembly followed suit with leaders pushing their agendas forward.Speaker Ganesh Timilsina himself is dissatisfied that every behaviour and activity of the House of Representatives influence the National Assembly. He says despite his attempts to prevent the overshadowing, it has been unfortunate that he did not garner the goodwill of the top leaders during political disputes.Reinstating powerThe National Assembly is a permanent institution. Therefore, it can remain operational even in the absence of the House of Representatives. Under normal circumstances, Speaker Timilsina initiated a positive practice by personally participating in different committees. Nevertheless, in the absence of the House of Representatives, the National Assembly often experienced inactivity.In December 2020, the Prime Minister at that time, KP Sharma Oli, dissolved the House of Representatives. Subsequently, a session of the National Assembly was convened on January 1, 2021. Despite lasting only seven hours over four days, this session, which took place after the dissolution, failed to address crucial public issues. Even after six months, important matters remained unaddressed within the House.On May 22, 2021, the UML-led government once again dissolved the House of Representatives. The meeting of the National Assembly and committees was affected once more. However, the dissolutions were declared unconstitutional by the Supreme Court, reinstating the parliament.The Constitution says that despite the closing of the National Assembly session, thematic committee meetings can still take place. However, both the National Assembly and its committees remained inactive until the restoration of the House of Representatives.According to Khimlal Devkota, a member of the National Assembly, when the House of Representatives was dissolved twice, it seemed that the National Assembly was also in a state of dissolution.Bimala Rai Paudyal also believes that the inability to resume the upper house is a mark of weakness. “Since the government was not in a position to call, the President needed to be consulted by the chair together with the consultation committee. That was not done either,” she says.Constitutional and legal distinctionsExcept for the Constitution of Nepal (1962) and the Interim Constitution of Nepal (2007), all other constitutions in Nepal provided for a bicameral parliament with the National Assembly or the Upper House and the House of Representatives or the Lower House. The practices before 2015 were under the unitary governance system, but after the adoption of the federal democratic republican governance system, the role of the National Assembly has changed somewhat.In the preamble of the constitution prepared by the ‘Constituent Assembly, and Administrative Organ Designation Committee’ during the drafting of the constitution, it is mentioned that some different qualifications have been prescribed for being a member of the House of Representatives and the National Assembly, with the intention that qualified people can be represented in the National Assembly.Chair of the National Assembly Ganesh Prasad Timilsina restates that the members of the upper house should be assessed based on the country’s expectations with clear criteria. There is no definite definition of an expert in the constitution. It has been stated symbolically, “…It is expected that the members should have some basic skills to face the challenges and fulfil their responsibilities.”According to the constitution, the responsibility of the National Assembly is to correctly establish the rights of the local level, state, and union, and to prevent the House of Representatives from trying to enact laws contrary to the spirit of federalism. There is an explanatory comment in the constitution about the propriety of the National Assembly – “This House is expected to fulfil its role to maintain creative and mutual relations between the national government and the provinces.”In addition, there are some constitutional and legal differences regarding the National Assembly. But the MPs are demanding that it should cease. When a bill originating in the House of Representatives is passed and sent to the National Assembly, and if the latter does not decide within 60 days, it proceeds de facto.This has placed the National Assembly in a dilemma. The Chairman of the National Assembly, Timilsina, says, “Such an arrangement should also apply to the House of Representatives, or both should be equal.”Need for course correction PM Pushpa Kamal Dahal speaking in the National Assembly meeting.Some instances have turned these so-called experts into a laughing stock due to their actions. On July 5, 2023,  a discussion on the Electronic Commerce (E-Commerce) Bill 2023 was tabled in the National Assembly. However, the parliamentarians misunderstood the main point and instead discussed the matter of electricity. The MPs, who had not read the proposal, suggested that electricity consumption within Nepal should also be increased besides exporting electricity to India and Bangladesh.During the meeting, Ramesh Rijal, the Minister of Industry, Commerce and Supplies, also mentioned that India would purchase electricity during the Prime Minister’s visit. Unfortunately, the bill was unanimously approved.Timilsina considers the incident an example, that in his six-year tenure, he does not want to remember. Som Bahadur Thapa, a former secretary at the Parliament Secretariat, termed the incident ‘a joke’ in the Parliament of Nepal. “This is strong proof of the kind of MPs we have, who speak without knowing what they are talking about.” Timilsina assumed the role of the speaker/chair of the National Assembly after the establishment of the Federal Democratic Republic. He had the opportunity to establish the system and the dignity of the National Assembly. However, instead of setting a positive example, he will soon be retiring after being accused of playing tricks with the Speaker and showing interest in the work of the House of Representatives.Timilsina has repeatedly commented on the affairs of the House of Representatives. The latest instance was during a seminar on ‘Japan: Past, Present, and Future’ held in the capital on December 2, 2023, he publicly stated that the election results of the House of Representatives did not bode well.Pointing to the emergence of a new party and the victory of some independent candidates, he said, “In a democracy, you get to choose candidates, irrespective of their party affiliation. However, is the signal positive?”In August/ September 2022, Timilsina wrote a letter to the Election Commission, urging them to extend the tenure of Speaker and Deputy Speaker. Upon receiving a response stating that the Commission would not determine the tenure of the elected Parliament, Timilsina directed the Parliament Secretariat not to execute decisions made by the Management Committee after September 17, 2022.This created conflict between the Speaker of the House of Representatives and the Speaker of the National Assembly and in the crux of this dispute between the parties, the country had to bear the consequences of this conflict. Laws could not be enacted promptly, and the place once considered the domain of experts was overshadowed by the party’s interest. A study conducted by the Democracy Resource Center Nepal (DRCN) on the legislative functioning of the National Assembly has revealed that the Upper House has passed some bills that go against the spirit of federalism.The report’s concluding remarks say, “…the bills passed by the House of Representatives have not undergone significant changes or discussions in the National Assembly. The conclusion section of the study states that – “Furthermore, some bills, contradicting the spirit of federalism and addressing the interests of interest groups, have been approved by the National Assembly.”Overall, in the last six years, parties have introduced individuals who, given their presentation level, have raised questions about the National Assembly’s justification. If there are no changes in the constitution, laws, and policies concerning the upper assembly, these concerns will persist.”",['erron border pillar placement plagu nepali farmer madhesh'],"['nation

"Regenerative Braking in EVs: Advantages, Disadvantages and Common Misconceptions ","Representational image Photo by Tanushree Rao on UnsplashWhile most of the nation was preparing for the festival of lights, Tihar in early November 2023, something no less exciting was fuelling our sparks from oceans away. A queer art festival was happening for the seventeenth year and we had a chance to attend it as delegates. Our delegation was made possible through the collaboration between the Outburst Arts, an art organisation based in Northern Ireland, UK and the British Council, Nepal.There is a clear distinction between cities in terms of their flourishing arts scenes, and this became apparent during a visit to Belfast, Northern Ireland, specifically for the Outburst Queer Arts Festival held in the charming city centre. The organisation of such a festival requires months of careful preparation and planning.The queer art festival started as short events lasting a few days. Now, after 17 years, it has grown into a ten-day festival with panel discussions, theatre performances, and exhibitions. Program guides were available at venues, partner hotels, local libraries, and shops. Many delegates, including us, came from outside Northern Ireland to attend.During the queer art festival, we had the opportunity to connect with art curators, publishers, artists, and representatives from other British Council departments around the world (Lithuania, France, South Africa, Turkey, Greece, Jordan, England, and Argentina to name a few.) Each event that we attended gave us a different insight into what the arts can do and how it can facilitate connections. We gained insights from queer publishers and art curators on the challenges they face in their own countries due to resources and sometimes from bureaucracy in systems. We also got to see the way people can thrive when given a platform to showcase their works, such as an art exhibition in which the artist reimagined intimacy for queer people.On the other hand, Nepal struggles by and large at times for queer visibility. There are no explicit spaces for SOGIESC (Sexual Orientation, Gender Identity and Expressions and Sex Characteristics) artists to showcase their works nor openly come together as a community, it all exists in pocket spaces. In the same way, something that struck us was the presence of older queer artists at the festival. It was not just for one particular event during the queer art festival. We noticed an active participation and involvement of older queer people throughout the festival there. It was fascinating to see queer artists in their 40s and 50s share their transformative and inspiring work. Whereas, back home, the queer folks at the forefront of queer art, advocacy and activism are mostly Gen-Zs and millennials. We have very few queer elders that we can count on our fingers who are diligently working for Nepali queer folks. Even among them, some still hold onto archaic notions and refuse to evolve and embrace changes. So, there’s that.From dream to realityDuring the queer art festival, we had the opportunity to connect with art curators, publishers and artists. Photo by Raphael Renter | @raphi_rawr on UnsplashBefore being selected as delegates, both of us joined online meetings with British Council Nepal and the Outburst representatives facilitated through Kaalo 101 (an art space in Patan), along with interested queer artists from Nepal. We had a total of three meetings where we discussed the possibilities and challenges of doing a queer art festival in Nepal. The discourse also entailed us sharing a presentation about the updates of the queer art scene in Nepal in the last five years. The updates included memorable leaps taken in queer arts from music to literature and fashion and more by artists from diverse walks of life. Days after the third meeting, the British Council extended invitations to us to attend the Outburst Queer Arts Festival.Our delegation is just one example of the transcontinental collaboration because it was something that happened for the first time and involved us. But, Outburst Arts and the British Council have been practising cross-continental collaboration for years. Even in this year’s festival, we witnessed a lot of artists from different continents work together in exhibitions, lectures, panel discussions, magazines and so on. The amalgamation introduced us to brilliant thought-provoking work that defies gender and sociopolitical norms. The power of transcontinental collaboration was beyond beautiful.Imagining queer arts in NepalPhoto by Nikolas Gannon on UnsplashThe queer art scene in Nepal is an emerging one. While a full-fledged festival may not be possible now, something small yet significant is achievable. Time and again, different organisations have been running large art exhibitions/tours for weeks and months. However, in the microcosm that is Nepal, especially Kathmandu, the capital is no stranger to art-oriented programs. What it has been unfamiliar with precisely is queer art. And the unfamiliarity is not something induced by the lack of queer artists and their art. Sadly, it is because of inadequate platforms, space and resources to pursue queer arts.Despite this, through the years there have been events and literature that have emerged centring on queer identity, but it has not come without its challenges. On collections of stories, “Pride Climbing Higher” and “Songs of Revolution” showcase stories from Nepalis across Nepal. There are not many stories reflecting the Nepali queer experiences otherwise. June Pride Parade by Queer Youth Group has gained momentum as well in the past few years since its conception, from a small gathering to now a large parade with performances from community members. The same can be said about Blue Diamond Society’s (BDS) Rainbow Visibility Pride events in August during the festival of Saa-Paru (Gai Jatra) which has been running for well over a decade; in recent years they have included flash mobs and interaction programmes as well in lead up to their parade. Individuals within the community have also organised their queer gatherings with friends, thus coming back to the cosmos of pocket spaces in celebrating queerness.While artists like us are creative with what we want to put out, we still need organisations like the British Council to foster spaces and connections to enable us to do that. Then and again, artists have come together and collaborated on queer-centric projects. But, we need funding and resources to achieve bigger-scale projects that unite more artists and transcend borders.Both of us advocate for queer rights and are involved in programs and activities that push the narrative further, extend the visibility of the community and normalise conversations surrounding queerness. Among other things, we are also the founders of Queering The Bond, a networking collective for Nepali queer folks and Shuby is also the founder of Queer Honky-Tonk, a platform to promote queer performances and networking with events such as a drag show or open mic every few months. However, both of us, individually or collaboratively can only do so much. The challenges of living in a capitalistic world oftentimes outweigh the passion we have for the queer art scene in Nepal. And this is where we expect the government and organisations to step up with policies, platforms and programs to provide spaces, opportunities and resources for queer artists. Here, the British Council joined hands with Outburst Arts, which paved the way for our delegation. We would not have known about the marvellous queer art festival at the other end of the world otherwise.Besides the limitations brought by insufficient spaces and social unawareness, the centralised capital does hinder queer artists from outside the city to connect, create and collaborate. Art already is centralised and elitist. On top of that, the concentrated Kathmandu Valley is of no help when it comes to making art accessible beyond its borders.Furthermore, there is also the expectation from basically everyone to have the perfect festival that caters to all people’s needs and wants. While the festival, if it should happen, is bound to be done with the right intentions, there is a lot of pressure for the first-time event itself. The festival will be inclusive and diverse. But, realistically speaking, it would be a struggle to make it relevant to each queer person from east to west.Speaking of struggles, a visceral feeling of uneasiness swarmed over me with each step I took while exiting the airport after the flight back home. I, Birat, personally felt that I could not be as free or unrestrained in Nepal as I was during my time in Belfast. No wonder a lot of the queer people we know opt for abroad.Seventeen years ago, when the Outburst Queer Arts Festival first began, it certainly was not as celebrated or large as it is now. What we are trying to convey here is that we do not have to start big. We can aim for something small yet promising. While there might be expectations to check all the boxes, it is crucial to be mindful of our capacity as well. But, we can be capacitated and this is where you – people in power, art enthusiasts, grant and resource allocators and media come in. It is time we all believe in Nepali queer art and create space for it to not only survive but thrive. It is imperative to understand that formulating our imagination into reality can only be possible through unwavering collaboration.","['regen brake ev : advantag , disadvantag common misconcept']","['represent imag photo tanushre rao unsplashwhil nation prepar festiv light , tihar earli novemb 2023 , someth less excit fuell spark ocean away .', 'queer art festiv happen seventeenth year chanc attend deleg .', 'deleg made possibl collabor outburst art , art organis base northern ireland , uk british council , nepal.ther clear distinct citi term flourish art scene , becam appar visit belfast , northern ireland , specif outburst queer art festiv held charm citi centr .', 'organis festiv requir month care prepar planning.th queer art festiv start short event last day .', ', 17 year , grown ten-day festiv panel discuss , theatr perform , exhibit .', 'program guid avail venu , partner hotel , local librari , shop .', 'mani deleg , includ us , came outsid northern ireland attend.dur queer art festiv , opportun connect art curat , publish , artist , repres british council depart around world ( lithuania , franc , south africa , turkey , greec , jordan , england , argentina name . )', 'event attend gave us differ insight art facilit connect .', 'gain insight queer publish art curat challeng face countri due resourc sometim bureaucraci system .', 'also got see way peopl thrive given platform showcas work , art exhibit artist reimagin intimaci queer people.on hand , nepal struggl larg time queer visibl .', 'explicit space sogiesc ( sexual orient , gender ident express sex characterist ) artist showcas work openli come togeth commun , exist pocket space .', 'way , someth struck us presenc older queer artist festiv .', 'one particular event queer art festiv .', 'notic activ particip involv older queer peopl throughout festiv .', 'fascin see queer artist 40 50 share transform inspir work .', 'wherea , back home , queer folk forefront queer art , advocaci activ mostli gen-z millenni .', 'queer elder count finger dilig work nepali queer folk .', 'even among , still hold onto archaic notion refus evolv embrac chang .', ', ’ that.from dream realitydur queer art festiv , opportun connect art curat , publish artist .', 'photo raphael renter | @ raphi_rawr unsplashbefor select deleg , us join onlin meet british council nepal outburst repres facilit kaalo 101 ( art space patan ) , along interest queer artist nepal .', 'total three meet discuss possibl challeng queer art festiv nepal .', 'discours also entail us share present updat queer art scene nepal last five year .', 'updat includ memor leap taken queer art music literatur fashion artist divers walk life .', 'day third meet , british council extend invit us attend outburst queer art festival.our deleg one exampl transcontinent collabor someth happen first time involv us .', ', outburst art british council practis cross-continent collabor year .', 'even year ’ festiv , wit lot artist differ contin work togeth exhibit , lectur , panel discuss , magazin .', 'amalgam introduc us brilliant thought-provok work defi gender sociopolit norm .', 'power transcontinent collabor beyond beautiful.imagin queer art nepalphoto nikola gannon unsplashth queer art scene nepal emerg one .', 'full-fledg festiv may possibl , someth small yet signific achiev .', 'time , differ organis run larg art exhibitions/tour week month .', 'howev , microcosm nepal , especi kathmandu , capit stranger art-ori program .', 'unfamiliar precis queer art .', 'unfamiliar someth induc lack queer artist art .', 'sadli , inadequ platform , space resourc pursu queer arts.despit , year event literatur emerg centr queer ident , come without challeng .', 'collect stori , “ pride climb higher ” “ song revolut ” showcas stori nepali across nepal .', 'mani stori reflect nepali queer experi otherwis .', 'june pride parad queer youth group gain momentum well past year sinc concept , small gather larg parad perform commun member .', 'said blue diamond societi ’ ( bd ) rainbow visibl pride event august festiv saa-paru ( gai jatra ) run well decad ;

Nepal’s ‘low-altitude’ snow leopard would face big hurdles in return to wild ,"The month of January saw major road accidents in different parts of the country, including Lamhi in Dang, Dhorpatan in Baglung, and Chandragiri in Kathmandu. Road accidents have been common throughout the country with Nepal Police data suggesting over 2,500 people dying in them annually. Despite this, the Ministry of Finance has shown reluctance to introduce the proposed Road Safety Bill to reduce traffic accidents, fatalities, and serious injuries, and enhance road safety. Instead, the Finance Ministry has asked the Ministry of Physical Infrastructure and Transport to include the proposed bill in the Public Roads Act. Along with that, the government’s initiative to pass dedicated laws on road safety and set up a mechanism, including the empowered National Road Safety Council (NRSC), to decrease accidents, has come to a halt.Keshav Kumar Sharma, secretary of the Ministry of Physical Infrastructure and Transport, says they asked for a dedicated road safety law that comprehensively addresses institutional arrangements was the need of the hour. This includes ensuring safety in road construction, promoting public awareness, providing training and communication facilities, implementing rescue mechanisms, and arranging rehabilitation for families affected by road accidents. However, the Ministry of Finance believes a separate law is unnecessary due to concerns about potential increased financial burden.Hourly needOfficials from the Ministry of Physical Infrastructure allege that the Ministry of Finance is approaching sensitive matters, such as passenger safety, solely from an economic standpoint. They say that concerns related to road, vehicle, and passenger safety are being overshadowed, and there are indications that this approach will continue. “The government is avoiding addressing the sensitive issue of road accidents and the associated human and material costs, fearing an increase in expenses. This contradicts the government’s commitment and policy to reduce traffic accidents in the future,” says an official from the Ministry of Physical Infrastructure on the condition of anonymity.According to the Ministry of Physical Infrastructure, the existing laws lack the vision and purpose necessary for developing a sustainable, safe, risk-free, and reliable transportation operation and security system. Therefore, the Ministry of Physical Infrastructure officials argue that a distinct law is essential to decrease road accidents and ensure the safety of pedestrians, including passenger transport workers and roadside residents, as well as pets, wild animals, and birds. “The Road Safety Act is the need of the hour as it will help us during post-accident rescue, treatment management, rehabilitation, and legal representation,” says the official.Currently, there are gaps in enforcing road rules, monitoring vehicle capacities, ensuring road structure safety, managing traffic signs, and organizing road safety facilities. The implementation of the Road Safety Act is seen as crucial to address these issues.However, there has not been a facilitative environment for providing education and raising awareness about road traffic safety, safety mechanisms, and coordinating among organisations related to road transport. The aspect of training drivers with skills and knowledge, as well as monitoring road safety on the roads, is also lacking. This is why experts have been suggesting introducing a separate road safety law to address these aspects.The Finance Ministry, however, says that road safety should not be downplayed by ignoring human sensibilities related to road safety and citing economic reasons. Officials from the Ministry of Physical Infrastructure argue that incorporating safety considerations in the Road Act does not automatically result in a decrease in accidents or the integration of post-accident rescue, relief, and rehabilitation efforts.“The existing laws do not address road safety anywhere. Due to its lack of clarity and inadequacy, it has not been implemented with due diligence. For instance, provisions such as those for vehicle inspectors outlined in the Transport Act have not been acted upon by the government,” says an official from the Transport Ministry.Policies and commitments, but no lawsThe Motor Vehicles and Transport Management Act (1993) includes several provisions related to vehicle registration, road permits, driver’s licenses, traffic management, insurance, and penalties. The Public Roads Act (1974) primarily focuses on road management. However, there is no provision in the Act regarding the National Road Safety Council.In this situation, Nepal has developed a 10-year road safety action plan but is yet to enact corresponding legislation. Unfortunately, government agencies and mechanisms are not obligated to follow the action plan, as it lacks legal guidance.Now, the Transport Ministry holds the view that if safety considerations are explicitly addressed in the Public Roads Act, the outcome will not differ from what the Finance Ministry has said. Given the Public Roads Act’s close association with the Department of Road, the ministry thinks greater emphasis will be placed on road construction. However, they argue that incorporating the road safety aspect into the Act would not be effective.Secretary Sharma of the Transport Ministry is tasked with ensuring road safety, overseeing physical infrastructure and transport, and coordinating efforts across education, health, home, law, federal affairs, and general administration ministries. This responsibility extends to provincial ministries, local levels, as well as various agencies, organisations, security agencies, non-governmental organisations, and related entities, each with their specific roles.“As all the agencies need to be allocated responsibilities for various aspects of road safety, we have requested them to collaborate in formulating a distinct law. This should encompass the reduction of all types of accidents,” said Sharma.The ministry believes that a dedicated law addressing road safety is crucial to mitigate severe road accidents in Nepal and to uphold the commitments made by the country on the international stage.Nepal has committed to implementing the Stockholm Declaration through the Global Road Traffic Safety Conference in 2020, as per the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. Nepal, which has incorporated sustainable development goals into its national development plan, has not yet commenced work aligned with these objectives.Nevertheless, Nepal’s neighbouring countries are already addressing road safety through legal frameworks. Various states in India have enacted road safety laws, and the effectiveness of these laws is contributing to a 50 per cent reduction in road accidents.In 1999, Bhutan also introduced a unified road safety and transport act. Pakistan, on the other hand, issued the National Highway Safety Ordinance-2000 to ensure road safety, distinct from its National Highway Authority Act (1991). Britain, Australia, America, New Zealand, and other countries have established separate road safety laws as well.Road safety neglectedIn Nepal, road safety has been consistently neglected due to the absence of dedicated legislation. Road safety expert Keshav Adhikari says that the government primarily focused on road construction, overlooks crucial aspects such as road safety and reinforcement. Consequently, roads are transforming into perilous pathways for both vehicles and passengers.“There is a lack of interest in formulating policies and laws aimed at mitigating financial losses resulting from accidents,” says Adhikari.He further points out that safety is not a governmental priority, as expanding the road network is perceived to yield more political benefits than implementing additional structures to enhance road safety.“When I worked as an expert in the Transport Ministry for over a year, I realised that promoting road safety is not a government priority,” he says. “Annually, more people die due to road accidents than those who die in natural disasters, but the government has not given it much attention.”Even though the prime minister, ministers, and MPs keep asserting that roads have been constructed, no one seems to be addressing the critical issues of road safety and quality.Saroj Sitaula, General Secretary of the Federation of Nepalese National Transport Entrepreneurs (FNNTE), says that the government must be attentive as accidents are on the rise due to various technical and human factors, including road infrastructure. “Many accidents can be mitigated by improving road conditions, installing barriers on the sides, putting up informational boards, and ensuring scientific and practical road markings,” he says. “We need to formulate a plan and progress accordingly.”Sitaula argues that the government should establish policies to create mechanisms for emergency rescue, treatment, and rehabilitation after an accident occurs. He emphasises the importance of enhancing road infrastructure, conducting a scientific examination of the technical condition of vehicles, and ensuring compliance with the law by drivers, passengers, and regulators. He says that blaming drivers and transport entrepreneurs for accidents is inadequate, and the government must fulfil its responsibilities.Roads are unsafeNepal currently boasts a road network spanning approximately 100,000 km, with the majority consisting of dirt and gravel roads. Among the more than 22,000 kilometres of national and subsidiary highways, numerous sections remain unpaved.Despite the government’s substantial investment in road construction and expansion, minimal efforts are allocated to ensuring road safety. Recently, all three levels of government have accelerated the widening of roads, incorporating asphalt and slopes. However, it appears that issues concerning road quality and safety are escalating at a faster pace. Roads that have been neglected in the guise of maintenance have become a nightmare for the public.Infrastructure expert Suryaraj Acharya notes that these problems arise due to the tendency to construct roads only after they have sustained damage, without considering potential issues during the initial construction phase.",['nepal ’ ‘ low-altitud ’ snow leopard would face big hurdl return

Queer art festival: Reflecting and imagining the power of collaboration in Nepal ,"Realme 12 Pro+ 5G. Photo: Realme IndiaRealme has launched its popular mid-range number series smartphone, the Realme 12 Pro series. The series includes the Realme 12 Pro 5G and the Realme 12 Pro+ 5G which are the successors of the Realme 11 Pro+ 5G and Realme 11 Pro 5G respectively. The Realme 11 series was widely appreciated for its design and performance at the price range. The 12 series has stepped up the game with an even better design. Realme has not only changed the design but has also upgraded the performance and the camera to compete in the mid-range price market. Realme recently has been focusing a lot on the design aspect and the price range performance. The 12 Pro+ has some major differences from last year’s 11 Pro+ which include design, IP rating, chipset, camera and charging. Let us see what the luxuriously designed smartphone delivers in terms of specs.Specifications of Realme 12 Pro+ 5GDimensionsLength: 161.47mmWidth: 74.02mmDepth: 8.75mmWeight196 gramsDisplay typeAMOLEDDisplay size6.7-inchResolution2,412 x 1,080 (FHD+)Refresh rateUp to 120HzIP ratingIP65 dust and water resistance Glass Protection0.55mm Double-Reinforced GlassChipsetSnapdragon 7s Gen 2 (4nm)CPUOcta-core (4×2.40 GHz Cortex-A78 & 4×1.95 GHz Cortex-A55)GPUAdreno 710OSRealme UI 5.0 based on Android 14RAM8GB | 12GBStorage128GB | 256GBRear camera 50MP Sony IMX890 main camera8MP ultra-wide camera64MP periscope portrait cameraSelfie camera32MP Wi-Fi802.11 a/b/g/n/ac/ax（Wi-Fi 6）Bluetooth5.2NetworkLTE | 5GSIMDual Nano SIMAudioDual SpeakersSupports Dolby AtmosDual-mic Noise CancellationHi-Res Audio CertificationSensorsGeomagnetic sensor, Proximity sensor, Light sensor, Acceleration sensor, Gyroscope, In-display fingerprint sensorBattery5,000mAh (typ)Charging67W SUPERVOOC wired fast chargingPorts and Buttons2 Nano SIM Card SlotsType-C PortPower ButtonVolume ButtonsColoursSubmarine BlueNavigator BeigeExplorer RedPrice (expected)Rs 50,000 (8/128GB)Rs 54,000 (8/256GB)Rs 60,000 (12/256GB)Design and DisplayThe Realme 12 Pro+ and the Realme 12 Pro share the same design and dimensions.

The unattended issue of road safety in Nepal ,"Ram Bujhaun Yadav with his land ownership certificate stands near a border pillar which he says was erroneously placed on his land. In October 2023, when 51-year-old Ram Bujhaun Yadav of Musaharnia Rural Municipality-5, Mukhiyapatti, Dhanusha, was at a relative’s house, someone told him that two Indian Sashastra Seema Bal (SSB) personnel were looking for him.Anxious, he rushed home wondering why they were looking for him.“They asked me if the paddy field in the no man’s land was mine. I told them yes and they asked me to cut down the paddy immediately,” he said.The paddy was not ripe and Yadav asked them for some time. However, the SSB personnel told him he had to cut down his paddy immediately.Ram Bujhaun and his wife Tetari Devi each own a 677-square-metre plot of land. As Nepal and India reevaluated the border, Ram Bujhan’s land was been deemed to be near the no man’s land as it now has two demarcation pillars.Frustrated, Ram Bujhaun cut the paddy before it was due to be harvested. Now, he has been asked to not plant anything on the land as it falls in the no man’s land.“Our border police don’t say a word. I can’t fight the SSB on my own,” says Ram Bujhaun adding he had decided not to plan anything on the land anymore.Woes of the farmersMany farmers in southern Nepal say their land has now been placed in India after the recent demarcation. When the Jamuna River, which flows through the no man’s land between Nepal and India, changed its course some two decades ago, some border pillars went missing. Locals say these pillars have now been placed encroaching on Nepali land.In 2018, with the then Chief District Officer of Dhanusha, Pradeep Raj Kandel, and an official from Madhubani district, Bihar, India, a team that included border security forces from both countries, the Armed Police Force of Nepal, and SSB of India began placing border pillars after land measurement by technicians.Locals have raised concerns, stating that border pillars have been positioned, encroaching approximately 50 to 100 meters of land into Nepal compared to the previous position. Many like Ram Bujhaun are unaware of when these border pillars were placed.“I did not know that pillar was placed here. After I found out when I asked the village leaders, many said they were placing the border pillars as they pleased,” said Ram Bujhaun.He was told to carry on planting paddy and that it would not matter as these issues had happened in the past. “They encroached on my land and have asked me not to plant anything. This is gross injustice,” he says.Ram Bujhaun’s family owns a total of 4,000 square metres of land, with 2,000 square metres belonging to him and the remaining 2,000 square metres to his brother Bechan. However, 1,000 square metres of his land is now located on the Indian side after the demarcation. Despite this, he has been farming on the land and continues to pay taxes to the Department of Land Management and Archive in Nepal.“They have marked my land to be on the Indian side and placed border pillars on it. I’ve been farming till now but I don’t know when they will ask me to stop,” he says.Ignorance of the governmentThe Madhesh province in southern NepalThe former ward chair of Mukhiyapatti Musharniya Rural Municipality-5, Ram Naresh Yadav, said that over time, India has encroached on numerous Nepali lands in various locations in the Madhesh Province. This, he says, happened due to the Nepali administration’s ignorance and weak stature.“They (Nepali administration) were careless and that meant the Indian side placed these border pillars by encroaching on Nepali land,” says Ram Naresh.He said that over 40 farmers from wards 1, 5, and 6 have land ranging from 300 to 1,600 square metres on the Indian side. “These farmers have land ownership certificates, but they cannot farm as the SSB says the land is in India and not Nepal,” said Ram Naresh.In 1996, land ownership certificates were distributed after surveying the land in the border area. Local Dharmendra Kumar Yadav said that since then, the locals have been paying their land tax regularly. In 2018, when the pillar was being placed, the locals protested when they saw their land was being encroached on. However, since the demarcation had been agreed upon by high-ranking government officials of Nepal and India, the farmer’s voices went unheard.“We tried to stop when the border pillars were being placed on our land. But the administrators from both sides forcibly put it there without even trying to hold a discussion,” said Harish Chandra Yadav. The Chief District Officer of Dhanusha, Chakrapani Pandey, says that the border pillars were placed by the technical team after the measurements and with the agreement of the high-ranking officials of the two countries.“The fields and houses that are built in no man’s land have recently been cleared. No one can do anything in this particular area,” said Pandey. “We understand the people’s concern but we cannot do anything about it now.”",['unattend issu road safeti nepal'],"['ram bujhaun yadav land ownership certif stand near border pillar say erron place land .', 'octob 2023 , 51-year-old ram bujhaun yadav musaharnia rural municipality-5 , mukhiyapatti , dhanusha , rel ’ hous , someon told two indian sashastra seema bal ( ssb ) personnel look him.anxi , rush home wonder look him . “ ask paddi field man ’ land mine .', 'told ye ask cut paddi immedi , ” said.th paddi ripe yadav ask time .', 'howev , ssb personnel told cut paddi immediately.ram bujhaun wife tetari devi 677-square-metr plot land .', 'nepal india reevalu border , ram bujhan ’ land deem near man ’ land two demarc pillars.frustr , ram bujhaun cut paddi due harvest .', ', ask plant anyth land fall man ’ land . “ border polic ’ say word .', '’ fight ssb , ” say ram bujhaun ad decid plan anyth land anymore.wo farmersmani farmer southern nepal say land place india recent demarc .', 'jamuna river , flow man ’ land nepal india , chang cours two decad ago , border pillar went miss .', 'local say pillar place encroach nepali land.in 2018 , chief district offic dhanusha , pradeep raj kandel , offici madhubani district , bihar , india , team includ border secur forc countri , arm polic forc nepal , ssb india began place border pillar land measur technicians.loc rais concern , state border pillar posit , encroach approxim 50 100 meter land nepal compar previou posit .', 'mani like ram bujhaun unawar border pillar place . “ know pillar place .', 'found ask villag leader , mani said place border pillar pleas , ” said ram bujhaun.h told carri plant paddi would matter issu happen past .', '“ encroach land ask plant anyth .', 'gross injustic , ” says.ram bujhaun ’ famili own total 4,000 squar metr land , 2,000 squar metr belong remain 2,000 squar metr brother bechan .', 'howev , 1,000 squar metr land locat indian side demarc .', 'despit , farm land continu pay tax depart land manag archiv nepal . “ mark land indian side place border pillar .', '’ farm till ’ know ask stop , ” says.ignor governmentth madhesh provinc southern nepalth former ward chair mukhiyapatti musharniya rural municipality-5 , ram naresh yadav , said time , india encroach numer nepali land variou locat madhesh provinc .', ', say , happen due nepali administr ’ ignor weak statur . “ ( nepali administr ) careless meant indian side place border pillar encroach nepali land , ” say ram naresh.h said 40 farmer ward 1 , 5 , 6 land rang 300 1,600 squar metr indian side .', '“ farmer land ownership certif , farm ssb say land india nepal , ” said ram naresh.in 1996 , land ownership certif distribut survey land border area .', 'local dharmendra kumar yadav said sinc , local pay land tax regularli .', '2018 , pillar place , local protest saw land encroach .', 'howev , sinc demarc agre upon high-rank govern offici nepal india , farmer ’ voic went unheard . “ tri stop border pillar place land .', 'administr side forcibl put without even tri hold discuss , ” said harish chandra yadav .', 'chief district offic dhanusha , chakrapani pandey , say border pillar place technic team measur agreement high-rank offici two countri . “ field hous built man ’ land recent clear .', 'one anyth particular area , ” said pandey .', '“ understand peopl ’ concern anyth . ”']"
6 popular music stores in Kathmandu  ,"Photo by pippen on UnsplashLife is filled with surprises and unexpected events and it can change at any moment. The only thing certain in life is the uncertainty. Change is a natural and inevitable part of our lives, and it may be positive as well as negative.Even though it is not guaranteed that we will wake up in the morning, we set the alarm every night with the hope that we will wake up in the morning. We do not know what each day is going to bring us, but we may have varieties, adventures, and endless opportunities.The push to exploreThe uncertainty sometimes forces us to explore those aspects of life, we never knew existed or needed. It also tests the mental strength of people and how they deal with it. The uncertainty has taught me to be grateful, as we never know what life throws at us.In life, everything does not go according to our plans, and if we do not embrace the change we will face huge trouble. The Covid-19 pandemic is the best example of uncertainty, we were constantly fearing death and it was uncertain that we would see the sunrise the next day.It is not certain that every decision in life will be correct, but if you fear not trying at all, you miss endless opportunities for learning and growing. When our decisions or outcomes are on the negative side, we get depressed and we might tend to think about committing suicide, but we forget that if we have life we have endless opportunities. Most of us plan for our careers, our love life, etc. and when those plans do not work out we start getting uncomfortable. But if we can deal with today, we can surely deal with tomorrow. We need to cherish little moments in our lives and know that nothing is permanent not even the failures and setbacks.We come here with nothing and leave with nothing. So why should we hold the egos and grudges against each other? Instead of making our life meaningful and enjoying the journey of life, we get into puzzles of accumulating wealth and we go against our own loved ones for it. Change is certainPhoto by Kathyryn Tripp on UnsplashNothing is permanent in life, everything can change in fractions of seconds. In today’s society, everyone is so busy, that we people have so less time for our loved ones. What I have learned over the years, is to find time in our busy schedule for our family because we never know when it will be our last day together with them. Yes! Death is a natural process, so if you have to die someday, why should you die with grudges in your heart? But instead of worrying about the inevitable, focusing on the things you can control will bring a lot of happiness in life.Uncertainty is not only a negative thing; it also brings a lot of opportunity because you dare to change. The life-changing experience will not come knocking down your door, you need to expose yourself. We learn by doing and experimenting, even though we might fail. But that is not the end of the world. I still remember hesitating while applying for the role of leadership, at my school level as it was not certain that I would be chosen.Even after being selected, I was uncertain about whether I could fulfil my responsibilities or not. But that uncertainty helped me grow out of my comfort zone and give my best input. If I had not applied for that role just because I was uncertain of the outcome, I would miss the biggest learning opportunity in my school life. So, do not let the uncertainty or the unknown ever stop you from trying and no matter how much we try, to plan life always finds a way to surprise us. It is important to stay grounded when we have everything we wish for because life can take such a turn that we had never expected in our wildest dreams. Similarly, nothing is permanent in life, the financial hardships, the grades, the breakups, etc. But the most important thing is not to lose hope during those difficult times.According to the data provided by Nepal police, around 6,830 people took their lives in the fiscal year 2022/23. There is nothing in life that cannot be resolved although it may take time, committing suicide should not be an option. It’s important to share feelings among family members or loved ones because together as a family any problem can be overcome.Embrace the unknown and focus on enhancing your life, instead of worrying about what will happen next. Always find time for your loved ones, as life is uncertain. We should be grateful that we are alive and accept that change is the only constant thing in life. Do not let the unknown, stop you from trying or achieving your goals and always remember that even if you fail, you still have endless opportunities.",['6 popular music store kathmandu'],"['photo pippen unsplashlif fill surpris unexpect event chang moment .', 'thing certain life uncertainti .', 'chang natur inevit part live , may posit well negative.even though guarante wake morn , set alarm everi night hope wake morn .', 'know day go bring us , may varieti , adventur , endless opportunities.th push exploreth uncertainti sometim forc us explor aspect life , never knew exist need .', 'also test mental strength peopl deal .', 'uncertainti taught grate , never know life throw us.in life , everyth go accord plan , embrac chang face huge troubl .', 'covid-19 pandem best exampl uncertainti , constantli fear death uncertain would see sunris next day.it certain everi decis life correct , fear tri , miss endless opportun learn grow .', 'decis outcom neg side , get depress might tend think commit suicid , forget life endless opportun .', 'us plan career , love life , etc .', 'plan work start get uncomfort .', 'deal today , sure deal tomorrow .', 'need cherish littl moment live know noth perman even failur setbacks.w come noth leav noth .', 'hold ego grudg ?', 'instead make life meaning enjoy journey life , get puzzl accumul wealth go love one .', 'chang certainphoto kathyryn tripp unsplashnoth perman life , everyth chang fraction second .', 'today ’ societi , everyon busi , peopl less time love one .', 'learn year , find time busi schedul famili never know last day togeth .', 'ye !', 'death natur process , die someday , die grudg heart ?', 'instead worri inevit , focus thing control bring lot happi life.uncertainti neg thing ; also bring lot opportun dare chang .', 'life-chang experi come knock door , need expos .', 'learn experi , even though might fail .', 'end world .', 'still rememb hesit appli role leadership , school level certain would chosen.even select , uncertain whether could fulfil respons .', 'uncertainti help grow comfort zone give best input .', 'appli role uncertain outcom , would miss biggest learn opportun school life .', ', let uncertainti unknown ever stop tri matter much tri , plan life alway find way surpris us .', 'import stay ground everyth wish life take turn never expect wildest dream .', 'similarli , noth perman life , financi hardship , grade , breakup , etc .', 'import thing lose hope difficult times.accord data provid nepal polic , around 6,830 peopl took live fiscal year 2022/23 .', 'noth life resolv although may take time , commit suicid option .', '’ import share feel among famili member love one togeth famili problem overcome.embrac unknown focu enhanc life , instead worri happen next .', 'alway find time love one , life uncertain .', 'grate aliv accept chang constant thing life .', 'let unknown , stop tri achiev goal alway rememb even fail , still endless opportun .']"
Realme 12 Pro+ 5G: Is it the best designed phone for 2024? ,"Pankaj Bikram Nembang and Kiran Rai.Kathmandu, November 9The special general meeting of the All Nepal Football Association (ANFA) is being held on Thursday in Hetauda. The primary agenda of the special general meeting is the potential dismissal of ANFA president Pankaj Bikram Nembang. An ANFA source told Onlinekhabar that the decision regarding the Nembang’s removal will be finalised today.In August, a majority of ANFA members submitted a petition, presenting 19 allegations against the current leadership, demanding the dismissal of both ANFA president Pankaj Bikram Nembang and General Secretary Kiran Rai, citing their alleged inability to effectively carry out their duties.However, Nembang chose to confront the dismissal proposal and brought the matter to the special general meeting. He maintained that, according to the statute, the authority to appoint or dismiss the general secretary lies with the working committee. Nembang included only his agenda in the discussion.The special general meeting will cast their votes on Nembang’s dismissal today. Out of the total 107 members (including districts, clubs, and associations) of ANFA, only 87 individuals will hold the right to vote in this session.As per the ANFA constitution, a two-thirds majority vote is necessary for the dismissal of the president.

Don't Miss,"Kathmandu, November 7In 2023, Nepali cricket has experienced a significant surge. Both the senior and U19 teams have successfully qualified for their respective World Cups. The senior team has secured a berth in the T20 World Cup, while the U19 team has earned a spot in the U19 ODI World Cup.The senior team secured their spot in the T20 World Cup, which is scheduled to take place in the US and the West Indies, by clinching second place in the Asia Qualifier. This marks Nepal’s return to the T20 World Cup after a decade.Similarly, the U19 team is set to make a comeback to the U19 World Cup after an eight-year hiatus. With a victory over the UAE in the qualifier final, the team led by Dev Khanal is poised to make history once again in January 2024.Over the years, Nepal’s cricket journey has seen significant milestones. The senior team participated in the ICC T20 World Cup in Bangladesh in 2014, while the U19 team had already made their mark in World Cup events. Since their debut in the U19 World Cup in Sri Lanka in 2000, Nepal consistently qualified for subsequent tournaments until 2008. Although they missed out in 2010 and 2014, they did take part in the 2012 edition. A highlight was Nepal’s U19 team reaching the quarter-finals in 2016.During their debut in the T20 World Cup, Nepal competed in the first round and faced hosts Bangladesh, Hong Kong and Afghanistan. The team did well as they beat Hong Kong and Afghanistan but lost to Bangladesh who qualified for the second round on a better net run-rate.The upcoming T20 World Cup will feature a new format, with 20 countries participating for the first time. This expansion allows for more associate countries to be part of the event. The 20 teams will be divided into four groups, each consisting of five teams. This means Nepal will have the opportunity to compete against at least two major cricketing nations, providing them with valuable exposure and experience against higher-ranked teams.According to former cricketer Sharad Vesawkar, who participated in the 2014 edition, bigger teams will now approach matches against Nepal with greater caution. “We played well in the Asia Cup and Asian Games. Winning the qualifier semi-final convincingly showcases our capabilities,” said Vesawkar.The U19 team will also test themselves against the future stars of cricket. It is safe to say that 2024 is poised to be another monumental year for Nepali cricket. It will be a year of celebration for Nepal’s cricket teams. Fans will be glued to their TVs, cheering on both squads as they face off against some of the world’s best teams.","[""n't miss""]","['kathmandu , novemb 7in 2023 , nepali cricket experienc signific surg .', 'senior u19 team success qualifi respect world cup .', 'senior team secur berth t20 world cup , u19 team earn spot u19 odi world cup.th senior team secur spot t20 world cup , schedul take place us west indi , clinch second place asia qualifi .', 'mark nepal ’ return t20 world cup decade.similarli , u19 team set make comeback u19 world cup eight-year hiatu .', 'victori uae qualifi final , team led dev khanal pois make histori januari 2024.over year , nepal ’ cricket journey seen signific mileston .', 'senior team particip icc t20 world cup bangladesh 2014 , u19 team alreadi made mark world cup event .', 'sinc debut u19 world cup sri lanka 2000 , nepal consist qualifi subsequ tournament 2008 .', 'although miss 2010 2014 , take part 2012 edit .', 'highlight nepal ’ u19 team reach quarter-fin 2016.dure debut t20 world cup , nepal compet first round face host bangladesh , hong kong afghanistan .', 'team well beat hong kong afghanistan lost bangladesh qualifi second round better net run-rate.th upcom t20 world cup featur new format , 20 countri particip first time .', 'expans allow associ countri part event .', '20 team divid four group , consist five team .', 'mean nepal opportun compet least two major cricket nation , provid valuabl exposur experi higher-rank teams.accord former cricket sharad vesawkar , particip 2014 edit , bigger team approach match nepal greater caution .', '“ play well asia cup asian game .', 'win qualifi semi-fin convincingli showcas capabl , ” said vesawkar.th u19 team also test futur star cricket .', 'safe say 2024 pois anoth monument year nepali cricket .', 'year celebr nepal ’ cricket team .', 'fan glu tv , cheer squad face world ’ best team .']"
Pankaj Bikram Nembang’s future to be decided today,"Nepali players celebrate after qualifying for the 2024 T20 World Cup. Despite losing to Oman in the final of the T20 World Cup Asia Qualifier, the Nepal cricket team will take part in the 2024 T20 World Cup that will be held in the US and the West Indies. Nepal confirmed its berth by beating rivals UAE in the semi-final of the qualifiers in a jam-packed Mulpani Cricket Ground on November 3.The entire nation celebrated the team’s accomplishment. The team were back in the World Cup after a decade. This would not have been possible without the hard work, motivation, and dedication of the team along with the constant mentoring from head coach Monty Desai. However, the most crucial element was the fans, who served as the team’s unwavering support system. They cheered for every victory and responded with encouragement in the face of setbacks.Back on the big stageNepal first took part in the T20 World Cup in 2014 under the leadership of Paras Khadka. Drawn in a tough group against hosts Bangladesh, Afghanistan and Hong Kong in the first round, Nepal’s performance was one for the ages as they narrowly missed out on the second round finishing second on net run rate behind Bangladesh. Many believed this campaign would act as a springboard. However, the team struggled in the T20 World Cup Qualifier in Ireland in 2015 finishing ninth and missing out on taking part in the event in India. This was followed by the loss of their T20I status in 2015 after consecutive unsuccessful qualification attempts in 2016.Road to gloryGulshan Jha after hitting the winning runs against the UAE during the ICC Men’s Cricket World Cup League 2 in Kathmandu on March 16. Post 2014, the growth of cricket in Nepal faced significant challenges, including political interference, internal conflicts within the team management, and a lack of accountability. The sport also grappled with financial and infrastructural crises, which particularly affected the organisation of high-quality domestic tournaments. Consequently, this led to instances of irresponsible and immature gameplay during crucial moments. Nepal also contended with the poor state of grass-root cricket and the subpar quality of practice venues.What also did not help was the government and affiliated bodies’ neglect, despite the sport’s popularity since its inception and its growth potential. Furthermore, the International Cricket Council (ICC) suspended the sole governing body, the Cricket Association of Nepal (CAN), in 2016 due to political interference. These challenges, combined with ongoing issues, led to a decline in Nepal’s cricketing standards, resulting in repeated failures to qualify for the T20 World Cup.Growth over the yearsDespite that, Nepali cricket continued. The contributions and accomplishments of former Nepali cricketers such as Shakti Gauchan, Sharad Vesawkar, Jitendra Mukhiya, and numerous other unsung heroes were always valued and acknowledged. Their dedication ignited a transformative passion for cricket in Nepal as many in the current team picked up the game following them. Moreover, Nepali cricket continued to progress over time. In 2018, the team earned its ODI status, and the subsequent year saw the successful reinstatement of its previously lost T20 status after Nepal received ICC Membership. That gave Nepal an added boost ahead of the inaugural ICC World Cup Cricket League 2. Before Monty Desai’s appointment, Nepal was in danger of losing their ODI status, which would have jeopardised all the progress they had made. Prior to Desai’s arrival, Nepal had faced a tough stretch, losing 14 out of 24 games. However, Desai’s influence brought about a significant transformation, completely turning the group’s dynamics around.By winning 11 out of their last 12 matches, Nepal not only kept their ODI status but also secured a spot in the 2023 World Cup Qualifier held in Zimbabwe. During the qualifier, while Nepal faced formidable opponents like Zimbabwe, Netherlands, and the West Indies, they displayed commendable resilience, putting up a fight in each match. Additionally, they achieved a victory against the US, demonstrating their competitive spirit.Nepal also got to take part in the ACC Emerging Cup 2023 talking on Pakistan A and India A. This proved to be a good test for the team which then went on to take on the senior teams in the Asia Cup 2023. Results did not go their way, but the manner in which Nepal competed against the best in the world, showed signs Nepal had what it takes. The greatest progress for the players seemed to be in terms of their gameplay, approach, and sensibility towards the game. Given the right opportunity and guidance, Nepali cricket attracted the attention of the entire cricket fraternity and was applauded for their fearlessness.Additionally, the team had the chance to train with the Rajasthan Royal Academy, allowing players to identify and address their areas of strengths and weaknesses. All these preparations allowed Nepal to perform brilliantly in the qualifiers with an increased sense of competitiveness. Positives to takeThe T20 World Cup qualifier tournament highlighted several noteworthy individual and team performances from Nepal. Despite close defeats against Oman, the team showcased their skill and earned another chance to compete on the main stage.Standing in Nepal and the T20 World Cup were familiar foes, UAE. In front of what seemed like tens of thousands at the Mulpani Cricket Ground, Nepal outshone the UAE, securing their spot in the T20 World Cup—a feat they had last accomplished in 2014, exactly a decade ago.This was a team effort and different players rose to the occasion.Aashif Sheikh’s composed half-century innings against the UAE in the semi-final, along with Gulshan Jha’s rapid-fire half-century in the thrilling encounter against Oman in the final, allowed Nepal to post a respectable total. This, coupled with a brilliant innings from captain Rohit Paudel, exemplified the maturity and discipline the team had developed over the years. Despite some concerns, particularly in the bowling department, the undeniable rise in the team’s standards, particularly in fielding and batting, stands as a significant achievement from the tournament.Nepal had a chance to finish the tournament strong, but Oman proved to be too good as they won a nailbiter in the final thanks to Naseem Khushi and Bilal Khan.As Nepal gears up for the T20 World Cup 2024, addressing bowling concerns while upholding batting and fielding consistency will be paramount. It will be crucial to grasp the nuances of overseas conditions.Additionally, making judicious use of left-arm orthodox bowler Lalit Rajbanshi, who has proven to be invaluable in the past, in tandem with the inclusion of Sandeep Lamichhane, presents a significant challenge that needs to be navigated effectively ahead of the major tournament.",['pankaj bikram nembang ’ futur decid

Cricket team handed pre-announced cash prizes for their performance in 2023,"Kathmandu, November 5Oman have beaten Nepal in a dramatic final of the T20 World Cup Asia Qualifier which went to a super over.Winning the toss and batting first, Nepal lost opener Aasif Sheikh early. But Kushal Bhurtel gave Nepal a good foundation scoring a quick-fire 31 before throwing his wicket to Aqib Ilyas. Wicket continued to fall as Sundeep Jora and Kushal Malla also got out cheaply.With Nepal in the spot of bother, captain Rohit Paudel and Gulshan Jha played a blinder of an inning. Jha hit the Oman bowlers all over the park and hit 54 of just 25 balls while Paudel remained unbeaten on 52. The two put up a 78-run stand to give Nepal a shot at a competitive target as Nepal got to 184 thanks to a late burst from Karan KC who smashed 20 of six balls.Bilal Khan stood out as the pick of the bowlers, claiming three wickets, while Zeeshan Maqsood also delivered an impressive performance. However, the remaining bowlers struggled to contain the Nepali batters, especially Paudel, Jha, and KC, who took them to task.In reply, Nepal did not start the game well. Despite picking a wicket, Sompal Kami was poor conceding 37 runs in his first three overs. Kashyap Prajapati took on both Kami and Kushal Malla who had no answer for his clinical batting. Aqib Ilyas was as impressive but threw his wicket away to Jha.Zeeshan Maqsood tried to take the chase ahead with Prajapati but once he got out to part-timer Bibek Yadav, a flurry of wickets followed. Some tight overs by Yadav and death over specialist Abinash Bohora gave Nepal control of the game. Bohora picked up the crucial wicket of Prajapati to put Nepal in the driving seat. But in an interesting turn of events, Mohammad Nadeem turned the game on its head scoring 24 of nine balls to send the match to a super over.Naseem Khushi then took over hitting three sixes off Abinash Bohora to all but win the game for Oman.

While Vriitya Aravind stood strong at one end, wickets continued to fall as no one could get going on a slowish pitch where spinners dominated the UAE batters.Kushal Malla was the pick of the bowlers taking three wickets in three overs and was supported well by Sandeep Lamichhane who was superb with the ball taking two wickets giving away only 14 runs in four overs. Aravind, however, kept going to score an impressive 64 as the UAE scored 134 in the allotted 20 overs.In reply, Nepal started the game positively.

T20 World Cup Asia Qualifier: Nepal lose nail biter against Oman in super over,"Kathmandu, November 2Nepal suffered a narrow defeat to Oman in the final group game of the T20 World Cup Asia Qualifier at the TU Cricket Ground on Thursday.This loss by 5 runs means Nepal have finished second in the group and will have to play their semi-final at the Mulpani Cricket Cricket Ground on Friday.Having asked Oman to bat first, Nepal got off to a strong start, quickly reducing them to 48 for four. The Nepali bowlers continued to take wickets, putting pressure on the Oman batters. However, a burst of performance from Zeeshan Maqsood, Naseem Khushi, and Shakeel Ahmed propelled Oman to a respectable score of 145 in the allotted 20 overs.Karan KC, despite being expensive, managed to secure three wickets, while Sompal Kami and Sandeep Lamichhane claimed two wickets each.

T20 World Cup Asia Qualifier: Nepal reach semi-final in style by beating Malaysia by 6 wickets,"Karan KC dominated the Hong Kong batters at the Mulpani International Cricket Ground on October 19, 2023.The stage was set at the TU Cricket Ground as Nepal took on their rivals the UAE in the final of the T20I Triangular Series. Coming in unbeaten in the series and at home over the past year, Nepal were the favourites. The UAE, however, was determined to shake off their recent losses to Nepal. Having been defeated multiple times in the past year, they were eager to outperform their rivals. That is exactly what happened, as Nepal fell to the UAE by four wickets in a tightly contested match.The T20I Triangular Series, featuring Nepal, Hong Kong and the UAE, acted like a warm-up tournament for the T20 World Cup Asia Qualifiers. These qualifiers will determine the associate team from Asia that will compete in the 2024 T20 World Cup in the USA and the West Indies.Despite Nepal losing in the final, the team did get some exposure as they had not played T20I cricket against competitive teams for nearly two years. Nepal were good in the four group games against both Hong Kong and the UAE but the loss in the final might have raised some alarms as the team will have to win at least one knockout game to qualify for the 2024 T20 World Cup.A look backThe T20I rivalry between Hong Kong and Nepal traces its roots back to 2012, with Nepal emerging as the dominant side, winning the majority of the matches. On the other hand, the rivalry between the UAE and Nepal has been longstanding, dating back to 2019. Before this series, the UAE had historically held the edge over Nepal in T20I encounters.Nepal, however, have had a mental edge against the UAE as they have time and again beaten them over the past year along with the two games in the T20I Triangular Series.The tournament highlighted Nepal’s much-anticipated dominance, with the hosts displaying exceptional form and advancing to the T20I Triangular Series finals undefeated. It was clear that Nepal were experimenting and testing their bench strength in the series prior to the 2024 T20 World Cup Asia Qualifier that starts on October 30 in Nepal.Not all rosyUAE lift the T20I Triangular Series trophy at the TU Cricket Ground on October 27. Despite reaching the final and narrowly losing to the UAE, Nepal’s performance underscores the need for improvement, as the T20I Triangular Series highlighted several pressing issues.The inconsistency of opener Kushal Bhurtel and his struggle to convert promising starts were major concerns for Nepal. There was a strong sentiment in favour of establishing a stable batting lineup with minimal experimentation. While young Kushal Malla demonstrated aggressive gameplay, he struggled to put together a composed innings, except for a blazing 92 off 41 deliveries against Hong Kong. There was also a recognised need to explore options in pace bowling to lessen the team’s reliance on Karan KC and Sompal Kami.The middle order of the team needs to step up if Nepal wishes to qualify and compete against the top teams in the US and the West Indies next year. Sandeep Lamichhane was absent from the tournament, taking some personal time off. His absence was notable as Nepal lacked a wicket-taking bowler in the middle part of the innings. His form, which has not been at its best, will be a crucial factor for Nepal’s success in the upcoming series.Not all badRohit Paudel and Dipendra Singh Airee gave Nepal a comfortable victor over the UAE in the T20I Triangular Series at Mulpani International Cricket Ground on October 18, 2023. The tournament provided numerous positive takeaways for Nepal. With the qualifiers on the horizon, the outstanding form of all-rounder Dipendra Singh Airee was a standout. His performance in batting and fielding throughout the tournament significantly boosted the team’s overall confidence.Lalit Rajbhanshi, the left-arm orthodox spinner, made a remarkable comeback, contributing to the improvement in the spin department. Nepal elevated its fielding standards with high-calibre catches and impressive efforts, showcasing a commendable display of skill and commitment.Another notable highlight from the tournament was the performance of Nepal’s death bowling specialist, Abinash Bohora. His consistent and impactful deliveries at crucial moments, coupled with his skilful variations, showcased him as a promising asset in the pace lineup.What next?Tournaments and series like these play a vital role before regional qualifiers, as they bolster players’ confidence, refine their skills and abilities, and enable them to pinpoint and work on their areas of strength and weakness.As expected, the tournament underscored challenges that require attention, strategies that need refinement, and squad stabilisation issues that demand immediate action. Moreover, many young players gained invaluable experience in the most daunting and demanding format of the game.The T20I Triangular Series served as a valuable opportunity for teams to acclimate to the playing conditions. This effort was spearheaded by the Cricket Association of Nepal and Nepal’s head coach, Monty Desai, who organised the event in collaboration with the pitch curators, ensuring the venues were well-maintained and of high quality.For emerging associate nations, arranging regular practice matches and tours can be a challenge. Thus, competitions like these play a crucial role in aiding players’ development. Additionally, excelling in this format can lead to international recognition, potentially opening doors to participate in major T20 tournaments such as the Indian Premier League (IPL), Big Bash League (BBL), and others. Consequently, players at the associate level stand to gain from these tournaments, including opportunities to attract sponsors, showcase their talents, and elevate their cricketing standards.The T20I Triangular Series served as a valuable warm-up for Nepal. The team now has a clear understanding of what it takes to progress to the next level. To succeed, they will need to continue playing the high-quality cricket they have demonstrated since Desai took over as head coach. However, the question remains: can they maintain that level of play under the pressure of the home crowd?

Ankle injury casts doubt on Dipendra Singh Airee’s participation in T20 World Cup Qualifier,"Kathmandu, October 27Nepal lost to the UAE in the final of the T20I Triangular Series at the TU Cricket Ground on Friday. This is Nepal’s first loss on home soil since April 2021.Being asked to bat, Nepali batters could not take advantage of the dropped chances the UAE kept giving them. Even though Kushal Bhurtel did make the most of it and scored a half-century, the rest of the team struggled to get going. Teenager Ayan Afzal Khan proved too good for the Nepali batters on the day as he did not let them get away picking up Aasif Sheikh and Kushal Malla.Bhurtel soon followed them back to the dressing room as Nepal were reduced to 68 for three. Just as a partnership was brewing between Rohit Paudel and Dipendra Singh Airee however, both of them threw their wickets away as Nepal had to rely on a late burst from Karan KC to get to 162 from their allotted 20 overs.In reply, the UAE batters started the game in attacking fashion with Muhammed Waseem making the most of the lives the Nepali fielders gave him scoring a quick-fire 45 and putting up a 71-run stand with opener Aryansh Sharma. Nepal did rally by taking some wickets making the game interesting but it was too late as UAE beat Nepal for only the second time in 2023.Despite ending up on the losing side, Karan KC won the Player of the Series for taking 10 wickets in five matches.",['ankl injuri cast doubt dipendra singh aire ’ particip t20 world cup qualifi'],"['kathmandu , octob 27nepal lost uae final t20i triangular seri tu cricket ground friday .', 'nepal ’ first loss home soil sinc april 2021.be ask bat , nepali batter could take advantag drop chanc uae kept give .', 'even though kushal bhurtel make score half-centuri , rest team struggl get go .', 'teenag ayan afzal khan prove good nepali batter day let get away pick aasif sheikh kushal malla.bhurtel soon follow back dress room nepal reduc 68 three .', 'partnership brew rohit paudel dipendra singh aire howev , threw wicket away nepal reli late burst karan kc get 162 allot 20 overs.in repli , uae batter start game attack fashion muham waseem make live nepali fielder gave score quick-fir 45 put 71-run stand open aryansh sharma .', 'nepal ralli take wicket make game interest late uae beat nepal second time 2023.despit end lose side , karan kc player seri take 10 wicket five match .']"

KC continued decimating the Hong Kong batters sending back Anshuman Rath and Babar Hayat reducing Hong Kong to 14 for four.The Hong Kong batters never really got going as Nepali bowlers continued to pick up wickets. If not for Yasim Murtaza, who scored 36, the scorecard would have looked different as Hong Kong were bowled out for 94.

Kathmandu, October 18Nepal have started off the T20I Triangular Series with a seven-wicket victory over the UAE at the Mulpani International Cricket Ground on Wednesday.Put in to bat first, the UAE did not have the best of starts losing opener Khalid Shah in the first over. The batters struggled as Nepal kept on taking wickets sending back Alishan Sharafu, Muhammad Waseem and Asif Khan cheaply reducing the UAE to 52 for four.Ali Naseer and Basil Hameed put up a 56-run stand to settle the innings and take the UAE to 140 in the allotted 20 overs.Karan KC was superb with the ball picking up three wickets.

T20I Triangular Series: Nepal ease past Hong Kong thanks to Karan KC,"As untouched and less discussed as the sports management industry is in Nepal, it has ample room to showcase creativity. Photo by Miguel Bruna on UnsplashIn 2023, Barbie named Women in Sports as their career of the year.Whenever I am out and about socially, there is always someone who seems pretty certain about not considering my profession as mainstream. Hold up! Sports as a career? In Nepal? You bet! This article aims to explain why women in this male-dominant sports industry in Nepal should not be viewed as a surprise.I have been part of the Nepali cricket industry in a private capacity for quite a while now. Armed with a Master’s Degree in IT from an American University, my choice to stick with sports management tends to raise eyebrows. While I am not an on-field player, I am definitely behind the scenes, playing strong games of serious deliverance with my team. We are all about creating what is not there.As untouched and less discussed as the sports management industry is in Nepal, it has ample room to showcase creativity. Being a commanding woman in a position can be challenging, but on the brighter side, the gender advantage has yet to fail me. As alien as I might be in sports management in Nepal, I have been accepted with open arms. The nature of the job is highly competitive, no doubt.Embraced by the sports fraternityPhoto: PixabayWomen in sports are safe, heard, and welcomed. I absolutely relish the addition of spirited women to the team. The nuances of sports are something women complement greatly. Sports management inherently rejects narrow minds. There is a lot of travelling, meeting people, experimenting, and remembering limitations. The adjustments are both trivial and clever. Often, in our part of the world, societal norms limit women from making career decisions, hindering them from living life on their terms. This restriction potentially keeps many capable women from pursuing the sports industry, where they could truly wield their power to make an impact. Change is gradual, and I hope to see numerous female faces in charge of stadiums someday in Nepal.Yes, there are challenges. It ranges from personal sacrifices to job security and opportunities. However, these are workable factors for any freelancer in sports management. The key is excelling at our jobs to thrive anywhere. Taking a page from the medical field, the seriousness we apply there should not differ in sports management. Sports is a powerful industry. Children grow up idolising what we showcase on TV. As glorious as the game is, it is every child’s dream to represent their country someday. Carrying that responsibility is our role in sports—an often thankless yet deeply satisfying job.Nepali sports industryThe fans went wild at TU Cricket Ground after Nepal beat UAE.Sports may be a smaller industry in Nepal, but globally, it is a behemoth. The world economy has shifted, and it is time we alter our perspective to recognise the potential of sports as an industry in Nepal. The idea of open commercialisation of sports remains somewhat unexplored, as it continues to be a more exclusive affair in Nepal. By sourcing innovative ideas, there’s a wealth of public attention and investment waiting to be tapped into, along with numerous practices to establish and discard. As the Nepali team achieves international records, the packaging of the sport becomes everything. There is plenty to learn from international sports management to make our industry highly marketable and poised for global entry.Sports such as cricket, football, volleyball, or even golf serve as key intersections for reshaping Nepal’s global narrative. Over the years, Kabaddi has witnessed a substantial surge in India, both in terms of viewership and commercial success. The primary challenge we grapple with is Nepal’s comparatively small market size, posing constraints on our ability to generate substantial economic gains. Therefore, there is unanimous agreement on the imperative for Nepal’s sports to venture onto the international stage.Nepal boasts many hardworking individuals, yet achieving this goal demands specialised talents in sports management with the requisite experience and the capacity to enhance existing values. In the long run, outsourcing such talents may foster dependence. Hence, a concerted effort is needed to inspire Nepali youth to engage in sports management, contributing to our sports ecosystem. There are various ways in which we can harness the potential of sports for our benefit. Encouraging youth involvement can be instrumental in capitalising on the multifaceted opportunities presented by the sports industry. There is a lot to explore if you think about it.",['t20i triangular seri : nepal eas past hong kong thank karan kc'],"['untouch less discuss sport manag industri nepal , ampl room showcas creativ .', 'photo miguel bruna unsplashin 2023 , barbi name women sport career year.whenev social , alway someon seem pretti certain consid profess mainstream .', 'hold !', 'sport career ?', 'nepal ?', 'bet !', 'articl aim explain women male-domin sport industri nepal view surprise.i part nepali cricket industri privat capac quit .', 'arm master ’ degre american univers , choic stick sport manag tend rais eyebrow .', 'on-field player , definit behind scene , play strong game seriou deliver team .', 'creat there.a untouch less discuss sport manag industri nepal , ampl room showcas creativ .', 'command woman posit challeng , brighter side , gender advantag yet fail .', 'alien might sport manag nepal , accept open arm .', 'natur job highli competit , doubt.embrac sport fraternityphoto : pixabaywomen sport safe , heard , welcom .', 'absolut relish addit spirit women team .', 'nuanc sport someth women complement greatli .', 'sport manag inher reject narrow mind .', 'lot travel , meet peopl , experi , rememb limit .', 'adjust trivial clever .', 'often , part world , societ norm limit women make career decis , hinder live life term .', 'restrict potenti keep mani capabl women pursu sport industri , could truli wield power make impact .', 'chang gradual , hope see numer femal face charg stadium someday nepal.y , challeng .', 'rang person sacrific job secur opportun .', 'howev , workabl factor freelanc sport manag .', 'key excel job thrive anywher .', 'take page medic field , serious appli differ sport manag .', 'sport power industri .', 'children grow idolis showcas tv .', 'gloriou game , everi child ’ dream repres countri someday .', 'carri respons role sports—an often thankless yet deepli satisfi job.nepali sport industryth fan went wild tu cricket ground nepal beat uae.sport may smaller industri nepal , global , behemoth .', 'world economi shift , time alter perspect recognis potenti sport industri nepal .', 'idea open commercialis sport remain somewhat unexplor , continu exclus affair nepal .', 'sourc innov idea , ’ wealth public attent invest wait tap , along numer practic establish discard .', 'nepali team achiev intern record , packag sport becom everyth .', 'plenti learn intern sport manag make industri highli market pois global entry.sport cricket , footbal , volleybal , even golf serv key intersect reshap nepal ’ global narr .', 'year , kabaddi wit substanti surg india , term viewership commerci success .', 'primari challeng grappl nepal ’ compar small market size , pose constraint abil gener substanti econom gain .', 'therefor , unanim agreement imper nepal ’ sport ventur onto intern stage.nep boast mani hardwork individu , yet achiev goal demand specialis talent sport manag requisit experi capac enhanc exist valu .', 'long run , outsourc talent may foster depend .', 'henc , concert effort need inspir nepali youth engag sport manag , contribut sport ecosystem .', 'variou way har potenti sport benefit .', 'encourag youth involv instrument capitalis multifacet opportun present sport industri .', 'lot explor think .']"
ACC Men’s U19 Premier Cup: Nepal cruise into the semi-final with a win against Saudi Arabia,"Painting ‘My Private Life’ by artist Priyam Pradhan at the exhibition Mani at Siddhartha Art Gallery, Baber Mahal. Photo: Chandra Bahadur AleUsing Pitt’s artist pen on paper, artist Priyam Pradhan presents My Private Life, a showcase of the current significance of his life depicted in abstract form.At the centre of the painting is a 1000-rupee note, within which Pradhan has intricately painted Lord Krishna, a man wearing a hoodie tenderly embracing his dog, and a woman. The woman stands tall, elongated in form. Towards the bottom of the canvas, a holy man reaches out his hands, appearing to be in flight.Priyam Pradhan has used a vibrant colour palette, incorporating bright hues such as pink, orange, and yellow, as well as green, black, white, and grey. This combination adds a dynamic and lively quality to the artwork.“The man in the centre is me and the girl in green is my girlfriend. And the faces are my mom and dad,” says Pradhan. “The sadhu (holy man) symbolises my desires that I don’t have many desires for materialistic things however I do understand the value of money.”The use of colours, figures and lines in an abstract form in his painting resembles the painting of American painter Paul Jackson Pollock. Like his abstract expressionism, Pradhan has expressed himself in his painting.Furthermore, this marks Priyam Pradhan’s third solo painting exhibition titled Mani (money), inaugurated on January 17 at Siddhartha Art Gallery, Baber Mahal.In his previous exhibitions, Pradhan’s artworks centred around Hindu philosophy and his spontaneous thought process. However, in this latest exhibition, he explores the theme of money and its impact on an individual’s life, delving into the reverberating effects of financial aspects.Understanding the value of moneyPaintings by artist Priyam Pradhan at Siddhartha Art Gallery, Baber Mahal. Photo: Chandra Bahadur AleAny form of art is known as a reflection of the contemporary time. Likewise, Priyam Pradhan’s paintings reflect the lifestyle, desires, obligations and more of today’s younger generation living in urban areas in Nepal.Pradhan himself is in his 20s and he has justified the want of most of the youngsters in their 20s, who might be declared adults and understand the need for money and materialistic things but are still kids at their heart who want to explore and experience life as much as possible.The exhibition has 27 paintings which Pradhan took around nine months to complete. According to him, while he was travelling the idea that his life was luxurious and him being capable of exploring anything he wanted to was because of money.And being an artist this concept lingered on him and he was compelled to create on the theme of money.Once you enter the gallery, you can also view an animated video, which introduces artist Pradhan and the importance of money, which is on the ground floor. On the first floor, a huge painting (193×62 in cm) Apatkalin Awastha using mixed media on canvas welcomes you and other paintings are small in size (18×30 in cm).“It is a team work and it is my introduction as an artist for the exhibition,” he says. “Also, being a recent multimedia graduate from Islington College, I wanted to explore my skills and I got my team. Then, like money, multimedia is relevant to current society.”Experiencing life through artPainting by artist Priyam Pradhan at Siddhartha Art Gallery, Baber Mahal. Photo: Chandra Bahadur Ale Priyam Pradhan says enjoyment is the meaning of life and he enjoys creating artwork. Moreover, Pradhan who came into the art world first being a tattoo artist feels blessed that he has the privilege to explore whatever he likes in his life.He also believes that the philosophy that says one should not be materialistic is wrong. “If material things are not important, why would one build a house? And after building a house why do they want to decorate their house?” he questions.Alongside, money and materialistic things, his paintings also explore love, romance, life and childhood experiences. Motifs like Pokemon, ramen noodles, animals, dancers, etc have been used in his paintings. In most of his paintings, he has used numerous white lines in wavy form and these lines for Pradhan indicate the sound or the energy that exists in the surroundings all the time.About using a pitta artist pen, he says, “I have enjoyed drawing and painting since my childhood and using a pitta artist pen helps me revisit that feeling of happiness and sense of freedom.”So many things happening on the canvas with the use of vibrant colours gives a sense of excitement to the viewers. Though referencing artists like Pollock, MF Husain, Picasso and more, his pen strokes give a sense of newness through his expression and thoughts about his life experiences.In his paintings, these bright colours and motifs are in harmony and are visual treats that can surely cheer up the mood of any visitor. Moreover, you can also get free stickers from the artist.If you too are in a gloomy mood and want to uplift a little, visit the exhibition that continues till February 6.",['acc men ’ u19 premier cup : nepal cruis semi-fin win saudi arabia'],"['paint ‘ privat life ’ artist priyam pradhan exhibit mani siddhartha art galleri , baber mahal .', 'photo : chandra bahadur aleus pitt ’ artist pen paper , artist priyam pradhan present privat life , showcas current signific life depict abstract form.at centr paint 1000-rupe note , within pradhan intric paint lord krishna , man wear hoodi tenderli embrac dog , woman .', 'woman stand tall , elong form .', 'toward bottom canva , holi man reach hand , appear flight.priyam pradhan use vibrant colour palett , incorpor bright hue pink , orang , yellow , well green , black , white , grey .', 'combin add dynam live qualiti artwork . “ man centr girl green girlfriend .', 'face mom dad , ” say pradhan .', '“ sadhu ( holi man ) symbolis desir ’ mani desir materialist thing howev understand valu money . ” use colour , figur line abstract form paint resembl paint american painter paul jackson pollock .', 'like abstract expression , pradhan express painting.furthermor , mark priyam pradhan ’ third solo paint exhibit titl mani ( money ) , inaugur januari 17 siddhartha art galleri , baber mahal.in previou exhibit , pradhan ’ artwork centr around hindu philosophi spontan thought process .', 'howev , latest exhibit , explor theme money impact individu ’ life , delv reverber effect financi aspects.understand valu moneypaint artist priyam pradhan siddhartha art galleri , baber mahal .', 'photo : chandra bahadur aleani form art known reflect contemporari time .', 'likewis , priyam pradhan ’ paint reflect lifestyl , desir , oblig today ’ younger gener live urban area nepal.pradhan 20 justifi want youngster 20 , might declar adult understand need money materialist thing still kid heart want explor experi life much possible.th exhibit 27 paint pradhan took around nine month complet .', 'accord , travel idea life luxuri capabl explor anyth want money.and artist concept linger compel creat theme money.onc enter galleri , also view anim video , introduc artist pradhan import money , ground floor .', 'first floor , huge paint ( 193×62 cm ) apatkalin awastha use mix media canva welcom paint small size ( 18×30 cm ) . “ team work introduct artist exhibit , ” say .', '“ also , recent multimedia graduat islington colleg , want explor skill got team .', ', like money , multimedia relev current societi . ” experienc life artpaint artist priyam pradhan siddhartha art galleri , baber mahal .', 'photo : chandra bahadur ale priyam pradhan say enjoy mean life enjoy creat artwork .', 'moreov , pradhan came art world first tattoo artist feel bless privileg explor whatev like life.h also believ philosophi say one materialist wrong .', '“ materi thing import , would one build hous ?', 'build hous want decor hous ? ” questions.alongsid , money materialist thing , paint also explor love , romanc , life childhood experi .', 'motif like pokemon , ramen noodl , anim , dancer , etc use paint .', 'paint , use numer white line wavi form line pradhan indic sound energi exist surround time.about use pitta artist pen , say , “ enjoy draw paint sinc childhood use pitta artist pen help revisit feel happi sens freedom . ” mani thing happen canva use vibrant colour give sens excit viewer .', 'though referenc artist like pollock , mf husain , picasso , pen stroke give sens new express thought life experiences.in paint , bright colour motif harmoni visual treat sure cheer mood visitor .', 'moreov , also get free sticker artist.if gloomi mood want uplift littl , visit exhibit continu till februari 6 .']"
T20I Triangular Series: Nepal register comfortable victory over UAE,"Entrepreneurship education is not just an investment in the education system; it is an investment in the nation’s future prosperity. Photo: Pexels/ Rodnae ProductionsIn the shadow of the towering Himalayas, Nepal faces a challenge that rivals the steepness of its mountainous terrain- the challenge of economic development. As the nation earnestly pursues its Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), it becomes increasingly evident that a transformation in the education system is not only necessary but also urgent. Rooted in common living strategies, the prevailing education model, especially in higher education, may not adequately prepare the youth for the demands of the modern world. In this critical juncture, the incorporation of entrepreneurship education emerges as a beacon of hope, offering a pathway towards a self-reliant and prosperous Nepal.Time to reevaluate the education systemNepal’s journey towards economic prosperity has been marked by challenges that demand innovative solutions. The commitment of the SDGs reflects not only a global responsibility but also a domestic imperative for sustainable development. For this, it is high time to reevaluate the education system in the country.The current education system in Nepal, deeply entrenched in common living strategies, has been the foundation of learning for generations. However, in the face of a rapidly evolving world, today’s generation aspires for more than the status quo. The call for independence reverberates through the aspirations of youth who seek a curriculum fostering critical thinking, innovation and entrepreneurial skills.Entrepreneurship education is a dynamic force capable of reshaping Nepal’s educational landscape. This innovative approach moves beyond traditional learning methods, providing students with the tools to navigate the complexities of the modern world. At its core, entrepreneurship education is about empowering students to implement learned information in practical and tangible ways.Consider a student engrossed in the intricacies of sensor systems during a science class, entrepreneurship education transforms this theoretical knowledge into practical applications, inspiring the creation of a sensor-operated door. Such innovation born from a fusion of science and entrepreneurship becomes a valuable mindset in solving practical problems.  Expanding the horizons of entrepreneurship education, let us delve into chemistry. Imagine students studying chemistry not just as a theoretical subject, but also as entrepreneurs in the making. Armed with entrepreneurial principles, these students can tap into Nepal’s rich biodiversity, exploring market demands for products derived from local plants.In the scenario, chemistry students could embark on a journey to develop performance-enhancing products based on market demand, harnessing the potential of indigenous flora. What makes this approach remarkable is that it does not necessarily require sophisticated machines or extensive human resources. Instead, it leverages the inherent skills and awareness of individuals within the community, paving the way for a grassroots economic revolution.Entrepreneurship in education Representational graphic. Image: FreepikThe beauty of entrepreneurship education lies in its universal applicability. It is not confined to science or chemistry alone. Consider an art student, for example. Through entrepreneurship education, they can understand what art to develop (product), how much to set the price (price), where to sell (place) and how to sell (promote) their artworks. Every subject becomes a canvas for innovation and enterprise.Moreover, entrepreneurship education is a powerful equaliser, recognising the unique skills and talents of individuals across various disciplines. It is not about fitting into a predefined mould but rather about unleashing the potential within each student. When every single person is aware of their skills and potential, they can rise to different levels, contributing to the overall progress of the nation.Entrepreneurship education goes beyond skill recognition; it is about nurturing the ability to produce goods and mastering the art of marketing. Returning to the example of the student developing a sensor-operated door, entrepreneurship education not only equips them to produce the product but also teaches them how to navigate the complexities of marketing it to potential users and clients.The impact of entrepreneurship education extends beyond individual success stories; it reverberates through the entire nation. A generation equipped with entrepreneurial skills becomes a driving force for economic growth and independence. They will be able to recognise the resources and ideas to utilise them to reach the global market. They will be able to be the pioneers in products and contribute to the economy. By fostering a culture of innovation, creativity and self-reliance, Nepal can reduce its dependence on external sources and strengthen its economy from within.In essence, entrepreneurship education is not just an investment in the education system; it is an investment in the nation’s future prosperity. It is a transformative force that has the potential to shape a generation of independent thinkers, innovators and entrepreneurs- the architects of a self-reliant and economically vibrant Nepal. Entrepreneurship education, by teaching students to utilise available resources (physical and financial) and make them commercial, becomes a cornerstone in the nation’s journey towards economic empowerment and independence.",['t20i triangular seri : nepal regist comfort victori uae'],"['entrepreneurship educ invest educ system ; invest nation ’ futur prosper .', 'photo : pexels/ rodna productionsin shadow tower himalaya , nepal face challeng rival steep mountain terrain- challeng econom develop .', 'nation earnestli pursu sustain develop goal ( sdg ) , becom increasingli evid transform educ system necessari also urgent .', 'root common live strategi , prevail educ model , especi higher educ , may adequ prepar youth demand modern world .', 'critic junctur , incorpor entrepreneurship educ emerg beacon hope , offer pathway toward self-reli prosper nepal.tim reevalu educ systemnep ’ journey toward econom prosper mark challeng demand innov solut .', 'commit sdg reflect global respons also domest imper sustain develop .', ', high time reevalu educ system country.th current educ system nepal , deepli entrench common live strategi , foundat learn gener .', 'howev , face rapidli evolv world , today ’ gener aspir statu quo .', 'call independ reverber aspir youth seek curriculum foster critic think , innov entrepreneuri skills.entrepreneurship educ dynam forc capabl reshap nepal ’ educ landscap .', 'innov approach move beyond tradit learn method , provid student tool navig complex modern world .', 'core , entrepreneurship educ empow student implement learn inform practic tangibl ways.consid student engross intricaci sensor system scienc class , entrepreneurship educ transform theoret knowledg practic applic , inspir creation sensor-oper door .', 'innov born fusion scienc entrepreneurship becom valuabl mindset solv practic problem .', 'expand horizon entrepreneurship educ , let us delv chemistri .', 'imagin student studi chemistri theoret subject , also entrepreneur make .', 'arm entrepreneuri principl , student tap nepal ’ rich biodivers , explor market demand product deriv local plants.in scenario , chemistri student could embark journey develop performance-enhanc product base market demand , har potenti indigen flora .', 'make approach remark necessarili requir sophist machin extens human resourc .', 'instead , leverag inher skill awar individu within commun , pave way grassroot econom revolution.entrepreneurship educ represent graphic .', 'imag : freepikth beauti entrepreneurship educ lie univers applic .', 'confin scienc chemistri alon .', 'consid art student , exampl .', 'entrepreneurship educ , understand art develop ( product ) , much set price ( price ) , sell ( place ) sell ( promot ) artwork .', 'everi subject becom canva innov enterprise.moreov , entrepreneurship educ power equalis , recognis uniqu skill talent individu across variou disciplin .', 'fit predefin mould rather unleash potenti within student .', 'everi singl person awar skill potenti , rise differ level , contribut overal progress nation.entrepreneurship educ goe beyond skill recognit ; nurtur abil produc good master art market .', 'return exampl student develop sensor-oper door , entrepreneurship educ equip produc product also teach navig complex market potenti user clients.th impact entrepreneurship educ extend beyond individu success stori ; reverber entir nation .', 'gener equip entrepreneuri skill becom drive forc econom growth independ .', 'abl recognis resourc idea utilis reach global market .', 'abl pioneer product contribut economi .', 'foster cultur innov , creativ self-reli , nepal reduc depend extern sourc strengthen economi within.in essenc , entrepreneurship educ invest educ system ; invest nation ’ futur prosper .', 'transform forc potenti shape gener independ thinker , innov entrepreneurs- architect self-reli econom vibrant nepal .', 'entrepreneurship educ , teach student utilis avail resourc ( physic financi ) make commerci , becom cornerston nation ’ journey toward econom empower independ .']"

Women in sports management can make a difference ,"Ram Bujhaun Yadav with his land ownership certificate stands near a border pillar which he says was erroneously placed on his land. In October 2023, when 51-year-old Ram Bujhaun Yadav of Musaharnia Rural Municipality-5, Mukhiyapatti, Dhanusha, was at a relative’s house, someone told him that two Indian Sashastra Seema Bal (SSB) personnel were looking for him.Anxious, he rushed home wondering why they were looking for him.“They asked me if the paddy field in the no man’s land was mine. I told them yes and they asked me to cut down the paddy immediately,” he said.The paddy was not ripe and Yadav asked them for some time. However, the SSB personnel told him he had to cut down his paddy immediately.Ram Bujhaun and his wife Tetari Devi each own a 677-square-metre plot of land. As Nepal and India reevaluated the border, Ram Bujhan’s land was been deemed to be near the no man’s land as it now has two demarcation pillars.Frustrated, Ram Bujhaun cut the paddy before it was due to be harvested. Now, he has been asked to not plant anything on the land as it falls in the no man’s land.“Our border police don’t say a word. I can’t fight the SSB on my own,” says Ram Bujhaun adding he had decided not to plan anything on the land anymore.Woes of the farmersMany farmers in southern Nepal say their land has now been placed in India after the recent demarcation. When the Jamuna River, which flows through the no man’s land between Nepal and India, changed its course some two decades ago, some border pillars went missing. Locals say these pillars have now been placed encroaching on Nepali land.In 2018, with the then Chief District Officer of Dhanusha, Pradeep Raj Kandel, and an official from Madhubani district, Bihar, India, a team that included border security forces from both countries, the Armed Police Force of Nepal, and SSB of India began placing border pillars after land measurement by technicians.Locals have raised concerns, stating that border pillars have been positioned, encroaching approximately 50 to 100 meters of land into Nepal compared to the previous position. Many like Ram Bujhaun are unaware of when these border pillars were placed.“I did not know that pillar was placed here. After I found out when I asked the village leaders, many said they were placing the border pillars as they pleased,” said Ram Bujhaun.He was told to carry on planting paddy and that it would not matter as these issues had happened in the past. “They encroached on my land and have asked me not to plant anything. This is gross injustice,” he says.Ram Bujhaun’s family owns a total of 4,000 square metres of land, with 2,000 square metres belonging to him and the remaining 2,000 square metres to his brother Bechan. However, 1,000 square metres of his land is now located on the Indian side after the demarcation. Despite this, he has been farming on the land and continues to pay taxes to the Department of Land Management and Archive in Nepal.“They have marked my land to be on the Indian side and placed border pillars on it. I’ve been farming till now but I don’t know when they will ask me to stop,” he says.Ignorance of the governmentThe Madhesh province in southern NepalThe former ward chair of Mukhiyapatti Musharniya Rural Municipality-5, Ram Naresh Yadav, said that over time, India has encroached on numerous Nepali lands in various locations in the Madhesh Province. This, he says, happened due to the Nepali administration’s ignorance and weak stature.“They (Nepali administration) were careless and that meant the Indian side placed these border pillars by encroaching on Nepali land,” says Ram Naresh.He said that over 40 farmers from wards 1, 5, and 6 have land ranging from 300 to 1,600 square metres on the Indian side. “These farmers have land ownership certificates, but they cannot farm as the SSB says the land is in India and not Nepal,” said Ram Naresh.In 1996, land ownership certificates were distributed after surveying the land in the border area. Local Dharmendra Kumar Yadav said that since then, the locals have been paying their land tax regularly. In 2018, when the pillar was being placed, the locals protested when they saw their land was being encroached on. However, since the demarcation had been agreed upon by high-ranking government officials of Nepal and India, the farmer’s voices went unheard.“We tried to stop when the border pillars were being placed on our land. But the administrators from both sides forcibly put it there without even trying to hold a discussion,” said Harish Chandra Yadav. The Chief District Officer of Dhanusha, Chakrapani Pandey, says that the border pillars were placed by the technical team after the measurements and with the agreement of the high-ranking officials of the two countries.“The fields and houses that are built in no man’s land have recently been cleared. No one can do anything in this particular area,” said Pandey. “We understand the people’s concern but we cannot do anything about it now.”",['women sport manag make differ'],"['ram bujhaun yadav land ownership certif stand near border pillar say erron place land .', 'octob 2023 , 51-year-old ram bujhaun yadav musaharnia rural municipality-5 , mukhiyapatti , dhanusha , rel ’ hous , someon told two indian sashastra seema bal ( ssb ) personnel look him.anxi , rush home wonder look him . “ ask paddi field man ’ land mine .', 'told ye ask cut paddi immedi , ” said.th paddi ripe yadav ask time .', 'howev , ssb personnel told cut paddi immediately.ram bujhaun wife tetari devi 677-square-metr plot land .', 'nepal india reevalu border , ram bujhan ’ land deem near man ’ land two demarc pillars.frustr , ram bujhaun cut paddi due harvest .', ', ask plant anyth land fall man ’ land . “ border polic ’ say word .', '’ fight ssb , ” say ram bujhaun ad decid plan anyth land anymore.wo farmersmani farmer southern nepal say land place india recent demarc .', 'jamuna river , flow man ’ land nepal india , chang cours two decad ago , border pillar went miss .', 'local say pillar place encroach nepali land.in 2018 , chief district offic dhanusha , pradeep raj kandel , offici madhubani district , bihar , india , team includ border secur forc countri , arm polic forc nepal , ssb india began place border pillar land measur technicians.loc rais concern , state border pillar posit , encroach approxim 50 100 meter land nepal compar previou posit .', 'mani like ram bujhaun unawar border pillar place . “ know pillar place .', 'found ask villag leader , mani said place border pillar pleas , ” said ram bujhaun.h told carri plant paddi would matter issu happen past .', '“ encroach land ask plant anyth .', 'gross injustic , ” says.ram bujhaun ’ famili own total 4,000 squar metr land , 2,000 squar metr belong remain 2,000 squar metr brother bechan .', 'howev , 1,000 squar metr land locat indian side demarc .', 'despit , farm land continu pay tax depart land manag archiv nepal . “ mark land indian side place border pillar .', '’ farm till ’ know ask stop , ” says.ignor governmentth madhesh provinc southern nepalth former ward chair mukhiyapatti musharniya rural municipality-5 , ram naresh yadav , said time , india encroach numer nepali land variou locat madhesh provinc .', ', say , happen due nepali administr ’ ignor weak statur . “ ( nepali administr ) careless meant indian side place border pillar encroach nepali land , ” say ram naresh.h said 40 farmer ward 1 , 5 , 6 land rang 300 1,600 squar metr indian side .', '“ farmer land ownership certif , farm ssb say land india nepal , ” said ram naresh.in 1996 , land ownership certif distribut survey land border area .', 'local dharmendra kumar yadav said sinc , local pay land tax regularli .', '2018 , pillar place , local protest saw land encroach .', 'howev , sinc demarc agre upon high-rank govern offici nepal india , farmer ’ voic went unheard . “ tri stop border pillar place land .', 'administr side forcibl put without even tri hold discuss , ” said harish chandra yadav .', 'chief district offic dhanusha , chakrapani pandey , say border pillar place technic team measur agreement high-rank offici two countri . “ field hous built man ’ land recent clear .', 'one anyth particular area , ” said pandey .', '“ understand peopl ’ concern anyth . ”']"
Priyam Pradhan explores the essence of money and life in ‘Mani’ ,"Regenerative braking representational image. Photo: FreepikThe electric vehicle market in Nepal has grown significantly over the past year. Electric four-wheelers and two-wheelers are being launched almost every month, spanning from passenger to commercial vehicles. Electric transportation appears to be an emerging trend in the automotive industry.New EVs are regularly introduced with advanced features as car companies develop unique electric platforms. One standout feature is regenerative braking.Regenerative braking was first introduced in 1967 by the American Motor Car Company (AMC) in their prototype electric vehicle, the AMC Amitron. However, Toyota became the automobile manufacturer to implement regenerative braking system (RBS) technology in their Prius series hybrid vehicles in 1997. Toyota brought up the new hybrid technology in the Prius when fuel prices were going up at a massive rate. 1997 Toyota Prius Hybrid. Photo: ToyotaBut what is regenerative braking? There are still many people confused about what it is, whether it is safe or helpful in fuel economy in hybrid cars and the regeneration of electricity in electric cars.In simple terms, regen braking is when a car saves energy by recharging its battery when you brake, helping it use less fuel or electricity and go further. Easy but scientifically, regen braking is a process used in vehicles where the kinetic energy produced during braking is converted into electrical energy through an electric motor acting as a generator. This electrical energy is then stored in the vehicle’s battery for later use, reducing energy wastage and increasing overall efficiency.Photo: FreepikRegen braking can be seen in all kinds of EVs, including cars, scooters, commercial vans, buses, bicycles, three-wheelers, and rickshaws. It now can be electrically managed to what extent the power and braking can be generated. Regenerative Braking work process in EVPrinciple of Operation: Regene braking works by turning the energy from slowing down into electricity.Electric Motor as a Generator: In EV or hybrid cars with regen braking, the motor changes roles from moving the car to making electricity when you brake.Switching Polarity: When you brake, the motor switches directions, turning energy from the wheels into electricity instead of using it to move the car.Generation of Electricity: The turning wheels make the motor produce electricity, which goes to the car’s battery.Power Electronics: Special electronics change the electricity from the motor into the right kind for charging the battery.Battery Charging: The electricity made during braking charges up the car’s battery, storing the energy for later.Integration with Hydraulic Braking System: Regenerative braking works with the regular brakes, blending them for smooth stopping.Photo: automotive-iqAdvantages and Disadvantages of Regenerative Braking The advantages are listed below:Energy Efficiency: Regenerative braking efficiently captures the kinetic energy generated during braking, effectively reducing energy wastage and contributing to a more sustainable driving experience.Extended Range: By using the energy that would otherwise be lost during braking as heat and sound, regenerative braking helps to extend the driving range of electric vehicles in instances such as travelling downhill. Reduced Brake Wear: Regenerative braking minimizes the strain on traditional braking components, mitigating wear and tear, and potentially extending the lifespan of the braking components such as brake pads, rotors and brake lines, thus reducing maintenance costs over time.Enhanced Driving Experience: Regenerative braking provides a smoother braking experience and a more responsive feel to drivers, enhancing overall driving comfort and control on the road.The disadvantages are listed below:Limited Effectiveness at Low Speeds: While regenerative braking efficiently recaptures energy during braking, its effectiveness diminishes at lower speeds which leads to decreased energy recovery compared to higher speeds.Complexity and Cost: Implementing regenerative braking adds complexity and cost to vehicle systems, potentially raising manufacturing and maintenance expenses, and impacting consumer affordability.Maintenance Requirements: Regenerative braking systems require periodic maintenance and calibration to ensure they operate optimally.Efficiency Variability: Regenerative braking may exhibit variability in efficiency under extreme weather conditions or on certain road surfaces, leading to fluctuations in overall energy recapture and impacting the vehicle’s efficiency.MisconceptionsFully Recharges Battery: Some mistakenly believe that regenerative braking fully replenishes the battery, but in reality, it only adds a modest amount of charge.Increases Braking Distances: There is a misconception that regenerative braking extends braking distances, but it enhances braking performance by complementing traditional brakes.High-Speed Only: While more effective at higher speeds, regenerative braking still functions at lower speeds, such as during city driving or stop-and-go traffic.Maintenance-Free: Despite requiring less maintenance than traditional brakes, regen braking systems still need periodic checks and maintenance to ensure proper operation.Significantly Boosts Range: While regen braking contributes to extending the driving range of electric vehicles, its impact is influenced by various factors beyond just braking efficiency.Only for Electric Cars: Although commonly associated with electric vehicles, regen braking systems are also found in some conventional vehicles, particularly those aiming to improve fuel efficiency with advanced technology.Photo: FreepikRegenerative braking might sound complicated, but it is pretty cool. Think of it as a way for EVs and hybrids to recycle energy when they slow down. Instead of just wasting that energy, regenerative braking turns it into electricity, which can then be used to power the battery.",['priyam pradhan explor essenc money life ‘ mani ’'],"['regen brake represent imag .', 'photo : freepikth electr vehicl market nepal grown significantli past year .', 'electr four-wheel two-wheel launch almost everi month , span passeng commerci vehicl .', 'electr transport appear emerg trend automot industry.new ev regularli introduc advanc featur car compani develop uniqu electr platform .', 'one standout featur regen braking.regen brake first introduc 1967 american motor car compani ( amc ) prototyp electr vehicl , amc amitron .', 'howev , toyota becam automobil manufactur implement regen brake system ( rb ) technolog priu seri hybrid vehicl 1997 .', 'toyota brought new hybrid technolog priu fuel price go massiv rate .', '1997 toyota priu hybrid .', 'photo : toyotabut regen brake ?', 'still mani peopl confus , whether safe help fuel economi hybrid car regener electr electr cars.in simpl term , regen brake car save energi recharg batteri brake , help use less fuel electr go .', 'easi scientif , regen brake process use vehicl kinet energi produc brake convert electr energi electr motor act gener .', 'electr energi store vehicl ’ batteri later use , reduc energi wastag increas overal efficiency.photo : freepikregen brake seen kind ev , includ car , scooter , commerci van , buse , bicycl , three-wheel , rickshaw .', 'electr manag extent power brake gener .', 'regen brake work process evprincipl oper : regen brake work turn energi slow electricity.electr motor gener : ev hybrid car regen brake , motor chang role move car make electr brake.switch polar : brake , motor switch direct , turn energi wheel electr instead use move car.gener electr : turn wheel make motor produc electr , goe car ’ battery.pow electron : special electron chang electr motor right kind charg battery.batteri charg : electr made brake charg car ’ batteri , store energi later.integr hydraul brake system : regen brake work regular brake , blend smooth stopping.photo : automotive-iqadvantag disadvantag regen brake advantag list : energi effici : regen brake effici captur kinet energi gener brake , effect reduc energi wastag contribut sustain drive experience.extend rang : use energi would otherwis lost brake heat sound , regen brake help extend drive rang electr vehicl instanc travel downhil .', 'reduc brake wear : regen brake minim strain tradit brake compon , mitig wear tear , potenti extend lifespan brake compon brake pad , rotor brake line , thu reduc mainten cost time.enhanc drive experi : regen brake provid smoother brake experi respons feel driver , enhanc overal drive comfort control road.th disadvantag list : limit effect low speed : regen brake effici recaptur energi brake , effect diminish lower speed lead decreas energi recoveri compar higher speeds.complex cost : implement regen brake add complex cost vehicl system , potenti rais manufactur mainten expens , impact consum affordability.mainten requir : regen brake system requir period mainten calibr ensur oper optimally.effici variabl : regen brake may exhibit variabl effici extrem weather condit certain road surfac , lead fluctuat overal energi recaptur impact vehicl ’ efficiency.misconceptions recharg batteri : mistakenli believ regen brake fulli replenish batteri , realiti , add modest amount charge.increas brake distanc : misconcept regen brake extend brake distanc , enhanc brake perform complement tradit brakes.high-spe : effect higher speed , regen brake still function lower speed , citi drive stop-and-go traffic.maintenance-fre : despit requir less mainten tradit brake , regen brake system still need period check mainten ensur proper operation.significantli boost rang : regen brake contribut extend drive rang electr vehicl , impact influenc variou factor beyond brake efficiency.onli electr car : although commonli associ electr vehicl , regen brake system also found convent vehicl , particularli aim improv fuel effici advanc technology.photo : freepikregen brake might sound complic , pretti cool .', 'think way ev hybrid recycl energi slow .', 'instead wast energi , regen brake turn electr , use power batteri .']"
Role of entrepreneurship education in Nepal’s quest for economic empowerment ,"The snow leopard rescued from Urlabari is currently being kept at the Central Zoo in Lalitpur. Photo: Aryan DhimalAs the gates to the vet clinic at the Central Zoo in Lalitpur opened, more than two dozen photojournalists thronged the facility and surrounded a metal cage aiming their DSLR cameras at a snow leopard inside.“Please don’t come close to the animal,” the zoo’s vet, Radha Krishna Gharti, told approaching photojournalists. But in the gush of excitement to take exclusive photographs of the elusive cat, difficult to spot even in its prime habitats, there were few takers for the word of caution.Nepal’s Department of National Parks and Wildlife Conservation (DNPWC) organised the photo-op two days after the male subadult cat, which was until recently found in the country only at altitudes higher than 2,000-6,000 metres above sea level, was brought to the zoo from Urlabari town(146 m above sea level). According to the department, the animal has sustained injuries to its right foreleg and cannot stand upright.Although officials involved said they are looking at releasing the animal into the wild after it recuperates, doing so will be a daunting task, adding that the zoo may be the only place where it can now survive.Not a wild catReporters and photojournalists take photos of a snow leopard being held at the Central Zoo in Lalitpur, Nepal. Image by Abhaya Raj Joshi/ Mongabay“Nepali snow leopard experts have come up with two hypotheses to explain how the animal from the mountains landed up in the plains,” said Sharad Chandra Adhikari, member-secretary at the National Trust for Nature Conservation (NTNC), a semi-government body that manages the zoo in Lalitpur, a town in the Kathmandu Valley. The first of the two hypotheses made public during the photo-op-cum-press conference, is that it was raised in captivity and somehow managed to escape into the wild. The second is that it lost its orientation while trying to establish its territory after separating from its mother.Kulbhushansingh Suryawanshi, director of the India program, Snow Leopard Trust, said that both hypotheses are plausible explanations as to how the snow leopard got to the plains in Nepal.A DNPWC official, who wished to remain anonymous as he is not authorised to talk to the press, said that it was more likely that the animal had been raised in captivity. “The way it sipped the water and ate the food zoo staff offered indicates that it may have been raised in captivity,” the official said.Snow leopards are shy cats living at extreme altitudes in the steep mountainous areas of 12 countries in Central and South Asia. Their global population spread over altitudes of 500-5,800 m, is estimated to be between around 3,900 and 6,000 as detailed coordinated surveys of the population in the range countries are yet to be carried out. In Nepal, their population divided into three blocks (eastern, central and western) is estimated to be between 301 and 400.Adhikari from NTNC said that researchers will now examine the animal’s scat to analyse its diet and try to find out whether it was roaming in the wild or had been in some sort of captivity. Researchers are also preparing to analyse its genes to try to find out to which of the three metapopulations in Nepal it belongs. They will also observe the animal’s canine teeth and fur to look for clues.Relocation challenge A snow leopard found in Urlabari town in Nepal’s plains in a cage at the Central Zoo in Kathmandu. Photo: Aryan DhimalThe whole process could take a few months to complete, and summer could set in in Kathmandu by then, officials concede. “The current temperature in Kathmandu is suitable for snow leopards, as we are in the peak of winter,” said Madhu Chetri, a snow leopard researcher from NTNC. But that could change as spring season begins in the Northern Hemisphere.The DNPWC official said that regardless of the findings related to how the animal got to Urlabarli, the animal would have spent a significant amount of time with humans during its recovery phase. “That would mean that it would have gotten habituated with having humans around,” the official said.Sending such animals back into the wild is a challenge, as they may have lost their hunting and other adaptation skills, he added. In May last year, officials at the Chitwan National Park released two rescued rhino calves into the wild, with limited success. The safety of the animals, which had gotten used to having humans around, was compromised as poachers could easily approach and kill them. Eventually, they were transferred to an enclosure in eastern Nepal away from human intervention.Veteran conservationist Professor Karan Bahadur Shah said that rewilding the snow leopard would be a daunting task, as the animals are territorial. “If we just leave the animal in its natural habitat, it will get killed by other snow leopards defending their territory,” he said. “The best option would be to keep the animal in the zoo for the public to see.”But Nepal’s Central Zoo has its own set of problems. The facility, established in 1932 as a private collection, has limited space and has frequently run into financial trouble. Conservationists say the snow leopard would need special facilities to cater to its needs.“If the government decides that the snow leopard needs to remain at the zoo, we are ready to shoulder the responsibility,” said Adhikari. “We have set up special facilities for animals such as the red panda and chimpanzees,” he said. “We can do that for the snow leopard as well.”Those advocating for keeping the animal in the zoo also said that Nepal is a snow leopard range country and the public, especially the young generation, also needs to see the different animals found in the country. “It has great educational value,” said Shah.Snow leopard expert Suryawanshi from neighbouring India also said that it would be challenging to release the animal into the wild. “If the team at the zoo can establish the exact cause of this behaviour [why it ventured into the plains] and can keep the animal away from human contact, then it might be okay to release it back,” he said. “But otherwise, there is little hope for it in the wild. Better to let it live in the zoo.”Back at the zoo, after the photojournalists are done taking photos, it is the turn of the reporters to point their smartphones at the animal. Then there is a contingent of senior wildlife department officials waiting in line to catch a glimpse of the animal. “So much for keeping it away from human contact,” a conservationist observing the hullabaloo from a distance said.This story first appeared on Mongabay and Onlinekhabar is republishing it under a Creative Commons licence.",['role entrepreneurship educ nepal ’ quest econom empower'],"['snow leopard rescu urlabari current kept central zoo lalitpur .', 'photo : aryan dhimala gate vet clinic central zoo lalitpur open , two dozen photojournalist throng facil surround metal cage aim dslr camera snow leopard insid . “ pleas ’ come close anim , ” zoo ’ vet , radha krishna gharti , told approach photojournalist .', 'gush excit take exclus photograph elus cat , difficult spot even prime habitat , taker word caution.nep ’ depart nation park wildlif conserv ( dnpwc ) organis photo-op two day male subadult cat , recent found countri altitud higher 2,000-6,000 metr sea level , brought zoo urlabari town ( 146 sea level ) .', 'accord depart , anim sustain injuri right foreleg stand upright.although offici involv said look releas anim wild recuper , daunt task , ad zoo may place survive.not wild catreport photojournalist take photo snow leopard held central zoo lalitpur , nepal .', 'imag abhaya raj joshi/ mongabay “ nepali snow leopard expert come two hypothes explain anim mountain land plain , ” said sharad chandra adhikari , member-secretari nation trust natur conserv ( ntnc ) , semi-govern bodi manag zoo lalitpur , town kathmandu valley .', 'first two hypothes made public photo-op-cum-press confer , rais captiv somehow manag escap wild .', 'second lost orient tri establish territori separ mother.kulbhushansingh suryawanshi , director india program , snow leopard trust , said hypothes plausibl explan snow leopard got plain nepal.a dnpwc offici , wish remain anonym authoris talk press , said like anim rais captiv .', '“ way sip water ate food zoo staff offer indic may rais captiv , ” offici said.snow leopard shi cat live extrem altitud steep mountain area 12 countri central south asia .', 'global popul spread altitud 500-5,800 , estim around 3,900 6,000 detail coordin survey popul rang countri yet carri .', 'nepal , popul divid three block ( eastern , central western ) estim 301 400.adhikari ntnc said research examin anim ’ scat analys diet tri find whether roam wild sort captiv .', 'research also prepar analys gene tri find three metapopul nepal belong .', 'also observ anim ’ canin teeth fur look clues.reloc challeng snow leopard found urlabari town nepal ’ plain cage central zoo kathmandu .', 'photo : aryan dhimalth whole process could take month complet , summer could set kathmandu , offici conced .', '“ current temperatur kathmandu suitabl snow leopard , peak winter , ” said madhu chetri , snow leopard research ntnc .', 'could chang spring season begin northern hemisphere.th dnpwc offici said regardless find relat anim got urlabarli , anim would spent signific amount time human recoveri phase .', '“ would mean would gotten habitu human around , ” offici said.send anim back wild challeng , may lost hunt adapt skill , ad .', 'may last year , offici chitwan nation park releas two rescu rhino calv wild , limit success .', 'safeti anim , gotten use human around , compromis poacher could easili approach kill .', 'eventu , transfer enclosur eastern nepal away human intervention.veteran conservationist professor karan bahadur shah said rewild snow leopard would daunt task , anim territori .', '“ leav anim natur habitat , get kill snow leopard defend territori , ” said .', '“ best option would keep anim zoo public see . ” nepal ’ central zoo set problem .', 'facil , establish 1932 privat collect , limit space frequent run financi troubl .', 'conservationist say snow leopard would need special facil cater need . “ govern decid snow leopard need remain zoo , readi shoulder respons , ” said adhikari .', '“ set special facil anim red panda chimpanze , ” said .', '“ snow leopard well . ” advoc keep anim zoo also said nepal snow leopard rang countri public , especi young gener , also need see differ anim found countri .', '“ great educ valu , ” said shah.snow leopard expert suryawanshi neighbour india also said would challeng releas anim wild .', '“ team zoo establish exact caus behaviour [ ventur plain ] keep anim away human contact , might okay releas back , ” said .', '“ otherwis , littl hope wild .', 'better let live zoo . ” back zoo , photojournalist done take photo , turn report point smartphon anim .', 'conting senior wildlif depart offici wait line catch glimps anim .', '“ much keep away human contact , ” conservationist observ hullabaloo distanc said.thi stori first appear mongabay onlinekhabar republish creativ common licenc .']"
National Assembly election taking place today ,"The National Assembly was formed to give experienced people a chance to be part of the parliament and help during the formation of important bills. In countries that follow the Westminster model of government, the upper house plays an important role. That, however, is not the case in Nepal as the country’s upper house has become a platform where individuals secure positions in the National Assembly based on their connections. As the election nears, many once again question the relevance and existence of the upper house.Things were different in the past as the initial years of the National Assembly saw experienced politicians and experts others in their field be nominated for the post. That slowly changed as the first batch completed its two-year term.“I understand why people are frustrated with the upper house. People expected experts but all we got was party cadres who lacked knowledge or experience,” says Bimala Rai Paudyal a National Assembly member. “Considering such behaviour and practices, what distinguishes the House of Representatives from the National Assembly?”A loser’s second chance Narayan Kaji Shrestha, who faced defeat in the 2017 general election from Gorkha-2, was elected as a member of the National Assembly on January 23, 2020. Elected from Gandaki Province, Shrestha currently is the Deputy Prime Minister and Home Minister of the country.Bhagwati Neupane who lost the election from Gandaki province and Bimala Ghimire who lost the election for mayorship in Bhanu Municipality also shared the same trajectory.Similarly, Mrigendra Kumar Singh Yadav and Jag Prasad Sharma were defeated in the House of Representatives elections, from Saptari-4 and Dang-3 respectively are now members of the National Assembly. Bam Dev Gautam, who lost the elections from Bardiya, secured a place in the upper house through nomination by President Bidya Devi Bhandari.Even those who did not win as ward member(s) got the opportunity to become members of the National Assembly including Sindh Bahadur Bishwakarma who was appointed on February 7, 2018. He is soon leaving his post on March 3.Despite the repeated criticisms, the political parties have not paid attention to this concern posed by political leaders and the general public. The latest proof of this is the list of candidates for the National Assembly elections scheduled on January 25. The list contains names like Krishna Prasad Sitaula, defeated in the House of Representatives elections in 2022 from Koshi Province, and Pooja Chaudhary, who lost in the provincial assembly elections 2022 from Rautahat-3 (a).Speaker Ganesh Prasad Timilsina, who led the National Assembly for the entire six years under the federal system, is also dissatisfied with the individuals who have made it to the upper house. “The allegations are something for the parties to ponder upon. The leaders should have prioritised involving intellectuals/neutrals rather than managing its members,” he says.The 59-member National Assembly elects eight representatives, equally from all seven provinces, with an additional three individuals nominated by the President. The Constitution ensures representation of women, Dalits, minorities or disabled communities, envisioning that experts, experienced individuals, and the most qualified people from various fields will become members of the National Assembly.Easy way inFile: A National Assembly meetingThere are some reasons why leaders aspire to join the upper house, and even the leadership create opportunities for them. In National Assembly elections, voters consist of local-level heads/deputy heads and provincial assembly members. Typically, individuals seeking these positions undergo a vetting process by their respective parties. As a result, aspiring members of parliament can focus less on persuading individual voters and more on gaining party support to secure their candidacy. Moreover, being a member of the National Assembly opens avenues to ministerial roles. The constitution prohibits a National Assembly member from becoming the Prime Minister, but not Deputy Prime Minister. Due to such opportunities, leaders are enticed to seek a position in the assembly.The National Assembly is currently in its fourth election cycle since the promulgation of the Consitution in 2015. Scheduled for January 25, this election aims to fill 19 seats vacated by individuals completing their six-year terms. The previous election cycles took place in 2017, involving 56 members, followed by 2019 with 18 positions, and 2020 with 19 positions.The cascading impactsFile: A National Assembly meetingAnother reason why the National Assembly is finding it difficult to justify itself is that it has become a shadow of the House of Representatives. The meeting of the National Assembly did not have one session when the House of Representatives was dissolved by then Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli twice. The demands and issues raised by the opposition parties in the House of Representatives automatically went to the National Assembly, where the parliamentarians of the ruling party put forward any proposal, they endorse it the same as in the House of Representatives.The latest example – is the main opposition UML did not allow the meeting of the House of Representatives to continue for five days from July 5, 2023, due to a statement made by Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal during his visit to India. Consequently, the meeting of the National Assembly was also paused during that period.The UML obstructed the House of Representatives for almost a month starting mid-July last year demanding a high-level inquiry committee to probe the 60-kilogram gold smuggling case and the resignation of the Home Minister. The National Assembly followed suit with leaders pushing their agendas forward.Speaker Ganesh Timilsina himself is dissatisfied that every behaviour and activity of the House of Representatives influence the National Assembly. He says despite his attempts to prevent the overshadowing, it has been unfortunate that he did not garner the goodwill of the top leaders during political disputes.Reinstating powerThe National Assembly is a permanent institution. Therefore, it can remain operational even in the absence of the House of Representatives. Under normal circumstances, Speaker Timilsina initiated a positive practice by personally participating in different committees. Nevertheless, in the absence of the House of Representatives, the National Assembly often experienced inactivity.In December 2020, the Prime Minister at that time, KP Sharma Oli, dissolved the House of Representatives. Subsequently, a session of the National Assembly was convened on January 1, 2021. Despite lasting only seven hours over four days, this session, which took place after the dissolution, failed to address crucial public issues. Even after six months, important matters remained unaddressed within the House.On May 22, 2021, the UML-led government once again dissolved the House of Representatives. The meeting of the National Assembly and committees was affected once more. However, the dissolutions were declared unconstitutional by the Supreme Court, reinstating the parliament.The Constitution says that despite the closing of the National Assembly session, thematic committee meetings can still take place. However, both the National Assembly and its committees remained inactive until the restoration of the House of Representatives.According to Khimlal Devkota, a member of the National Assembly, when the House of Representatives was dissolved twice, it seemed that the National Assembly was also in a state of dissolution.Bimala Rai Paudyal also believes that the inability to resume the upper house is a mark of weakness. “Since the government was not in a position to call, the President needed to be consulted by the chair together with the consultation committee. That was not done either,” she says.Constitutional and legal distinctionsExcept for the Constitution of Nepal (1962) and the Interim Constitution of Nepal (2007), all other constitutions in Nepal provided for a bicameral parliament with the National Assembly or the Upper House and the House of Representatives or the Lower House. The practices before 2015 were under the unitary governance system, but after the adoption of the federal democratic republican governance system, the role of the National Assembly has changed somewhat.In the preamble of the constitution prepared by the ‘Constituent Assembly, and Administrative Organ Designation Committee’ during the drafting of the constitution, it is mentioned that some different qualifications have been prescribed for being a member of the House of Representatives and the National Assembly, with the intention that qualified people can be represented in the National Assembly.Chair of the National Assembly Ganesh Prasad Timilsina restates that the members of the upper house should be assessed based on the country’s expectations with clear criteria. There is no definite definition of an expert in the constitution. It has been stated symbolically, “…It is expected that the members should have some basic skills to face the challenges and fulfil their responsibilities.”According to the constitution, the responsibility of the National Assembly is to correctly establish the rights of the local level, state, and union, and to prevent the House of Representatives from trying to enact laws contrary to the spirit of federalism. There is an explanatory comment in the constitution about the propriety of the National Assembly – “This House is expected to fulfil its role to maintain creative and mutual relations between the national government and the provinces.”In addition, there are some constitutional and legal differences regarding the National Assembly. But the MPs are demanding that it should cease. When a bill originating in the House of Representatives is passed and sent to the National Assembly, and if the latter does not decide within 60 days, it proceeds de facto.This has placed the National Assembly in a dilemma. The Chairman of the National Assembly, Timilsina, says, “Such an arrangement should also apply to the House of Representatives, or both should be equal.”Need for course correction PM Pushpa Kamal Dahal speaking in the National Assembly meeting.Some instances have turned these so-called experts into a laughing stock due to their actions. On July 5, 2023,  a discussion on the Electronic Commerce (E-Commerce) Bill 2023 was tabled in the National Assembly. However, the parliamentarians misunderstood the main point and instead discussed the matter of electricity. The MPs, who had not read the proposal, suggested that electricity consumption within Nepal should also be increased besides exporting electricity to India and Bangladesh.During the meeting, Ramesh Rijal, the Minister of Industry, Commerce and Supplies, also mentioned that India would purchase electricity during the Prime Minister’s visit. Unfortunately, the bill was unanimously approved.Timilsina considers the incident an example, that in his six-year tenure, he does not want to remember. Som Bahadur Thapa, a former secretary at the Parliament Secretariat, termed the incident ‘a joke’ in the Parliament of Nepal. “This is strong proof of the kind of MPs we have, who speak without knowing what they are talking about.” Timilsina assumed the role of the speaker/chair of the National Assembly after the establishment of the Federal Democratic Republic. He had the opportunity to establish the system and the dignity of the National Assembly. However, instead of setting a positive example, he will soon be retiring after being accused of playing tricks with the Speaker and showing interest in the work of the House of Representatives.Timilsina has repeatedly commented on the affairs of the House of Representatives. The latest instance was during a seminar on ‘Japan: Past, Present, and Future’ held in the capital on December 2, 2023, he publicly stated that the election results of the House of Representatives did not bode well.Pointing to the emergence of a new party and the victory of some independent candidates, he said, “In a democracy, you get to choose candidates, irrespective of their party affiliation. However, is the signal positive?”In August/ September 2022, Timilsina wrote a letter to the Election Commission, urging them to extend the tenure of Speaker and Deputy Speaker. Upon receiving a response stating that the Commission would not determine the tenure of the elected Parliament, Timilsina directed the Parliament Secretariat not to execute decisions made by the Management Committee after September 17, 2022.This created conflict between the Speaker of the House of Representatives and the Speaker of the National Assembly and in the crux of this dispute between the parties, the country had to bear the consequences of this conflict. Laws could not be enacted promptly, and the place once considered the domain of experts was overshadowed by the party’s interest. A study conducted by the Democracy Resource Center Nepal (DRCN) on the legislative functioning of the National Assembly has revealed that the Upper House has passed some bills that go against the spirit of federalism.The report’s concluding remarks say, “…the bills passed by the House of Representatives have not undergone significant changes or discussions in the National Assembly. The conclusion section of the study states that – “Furthermore, some bills, contradicting the spirit of federalism and addressing the interests of interest groups, have been approved by the National Assembly.”Overall, in the last six years, parties have introduced individuals who, given their presentation level, have raised questions about the National Assembly’s justification. If there are no changes in the constitution, laws, and policies concerning the upper assembly, these concerns will persist.”",['nation assembl elect take place today'],"['nation assembl form give

Santoshi Shrestha wins gold on marathon debut ,"Representational image Photo by Tanushree Rao on UnsplashWhile most of the nation was preparing for the festival of lights, Tihar in early November 2023, something no less exciting was fuelling our sparks from oceans away. A queer art festival was happening for the seventeenth year and we had a chance to attend it as delegates. Our delegation was made possible through the collaboration between the Outburst Arts, an art organisation based in Northern Ireland, UK and the British Council, Nepal.There is a clear distinction between cities in terms of their flourishing arts scenes, and this became apparent during a visit to Belfast, Northern Ireland, specifically for the Outburst Queer Arts Festival held in the charming city centre. The organisation of such a festival requires months of careful preparation and planning.The queer art festival started as short events lasting a few days. Now, after 17 years, it has grown into a ten-day festival with panel discussions, theatre performances, and exhibitions. Program guides were available at venues, partner hotels, local libraries, and shops. Many delegates, including us, came from outside Northern Ireland to attend.During the queer art festival, we had the opportunity to connect with art curators, publishers, artists, and representatives from other British Council departments around the world (Lithuania, France, South Africa, Turkey, Greece, Jordan, England, and Argentina to name a few.) Each event that we attended gave us a different insight into what the arts can do and how it can facilitate connections. We gained insights from queer publishers and art curators on the challenges they face in their own countries due to resources and sometimes from bureaucracy in systems. We also got to see the way people can thrive when given a platform to showcase their works, such as an art exhibition in which the artist reimagined intimacy for queer people.On the other hand, Nepal struggles by and large at times for queer visibility. There are no explicit spaces for SOGIESC (Sexual Orientation, Gender Identity and Expressions and Sex Characteristics) artists to showcase their works nor openly come together as a community, it all exists in pocket spaces. In the same way, something that struck us was the presence of older queer artists at the festival. It was not just for one particular event during the queer art festival. We noticed an active participation and involvement of older queer people throughout the festival there. It was fascinating to see queer artists in their 40s and 50s share their transformative and inspiring work. Whereas, back home, the queer folks at the forefront of queer art, advocacy and activism are mostly Gen-Zs and millennials. We have very few queer elders that we can count on our fingers who are diligently working for Nepali queer folks. Even among them, some still hold onto archaic notions and refuse to evolve and embrace changes. So, there’s that.From dream to realityDuring the queer art festival, we had the opportunity to connect with art curators, publishers and artists. Photo by Raphael Renter | @raphi_rawr on UnsplashBefore being selected as delegates, both of us joined online meetings with British Council Nepal and the Outburst representatives facilitated through Kaalo 101 (an art space in Patan), along with interested queer artists from Nepal. We had a total of three meetings where we discussed the possibilities and challenges of doing a queer art festival in Nepal. The discourse also entailed us sharing a presentation about the updates of the queer art scene in Nepal in the last five years. The updates included memorable leaps taken in queer arts from music to literature and fashion and more by artists from diverse walks of life. Days after the third meeting, the British Council extended invitations to us to attend the Outburst Queer Arts Festival.Our delegation is just one example of the transcontinental collaboration because it was something that happened for the first time and involved us. But, Outburst Arts and the British Council have been practising cross-continental collaboration for years. Even in this year’s festival, we witnessed a lot of artists from different continents work together in exhibitions, lectures, panel discussions, magazines and so on. The amalgamation introduced us to brilliant thought-provoking work that defies gender and sociopolitical norms. The power of transcontinental collaboration was beyond beautiful.Imagining queer arts in NepalPhoto by Nikolas Gannon on UnsplashThe queer art scene in Nepal is an emerging one. While a full-fledged festival may not be possible now, something small yet significant is achievable. Time and again, different organisations have been running large art exhibitions/tours for weeks and months. However, in the microcosm that is Nepal, especially Kathmandu, the capital is no stranger to art-oriented programs. What it has been unfamiliar with precisely is queer art. And the unfamiliarity is not something induced by the lack of queer artists and their art. Sadly, it is because of inadequate platforms, space and resources to pursue queer arts.Despite this, through the years there have been events and literature that have emerged centring on queer identity, but it has not come without its challenges. On collections of stories, “Pride Climbing Higher” and “Songs of Revolution” showcase stories from Nepalis across Nepal. There are not many stories reflecting the Nepali queer experiences otherwise. June Pride Parade by Queer Youth Group has gained momentum as well in the past few years since its conception, from a small gathering to now a large parade with performances from community members. The same can be said about Blue Diamond Society’s (BDS) Rainbow Visibility Pride events in August during the festival of Saa-Paru (Gai Jatra) which has been running for well over a decade; in recent years they have included flash mobs and interaction programmes as well in lead up to their parade. Individuals within the community have also organised their queer gatherings with friends, thus coming back to the cosmos of pocket spaces in celebrating queerness.While artists like us are creative with what we want to put out, we still need organisations like the British Council to foster spaces and connections to enable us to do that. Then and again, artists have come together and collaborated on queer-centric projects. But, we need funding and resources to achieve bigger-scale projects that unite more artists and transcend borders.Both of us advocate for queer rights and are involved in programs and activities that push the narrative further, extend the visibility of the community and normalise conversations surrounding queerness. Among other things, we are also the founders of Queering The Bond, a networking collective for Nepali queer folks and Shuby is also the founder of Queer Honky-Tonk, a platform to promote queer performances and networking with events such as a drag show or open mic every few months. However, both of us, individually or collaboratively can only do so much. The challenges of living in a capitalistic world oftentimes outweigh the passion we have for the queer art scene in Nepal. And this is where we expect the government and organisations to step up with policies, platforms and programs to provide spaces, opportunities and resources for queer artists. Here, the British Council joined hands with Outburst Arts, which paved the way for our delegation. We would not have known about the marvellous queer art festival at the other end of the world otherwise.Besides the limitations brought by insufficient spaces and social unawareness, the centralised capital does hinder queer artists from outside the city to connect, create and collaborate. Art already is centralised and elitist. On top of that, the concentrated Kathmandu Valley is of no help when it comes to making art accessible beyond its borders.Furthermore, there is also the expectation from basically everyone to have the perfect festival that caters to all people’s needs and wants. While the festival, if it should happen, is bound to be done with the right intentions, there is a lot of pressure for the first-time event itself. The festival will be inclusive and diverse. But, realistically speaking, it would be a struggle to make it relevant to each queer person from east to west.Speaking of struggles, a visceral feeling of uneasiness swarmed over me with each step I took while exiting the airport after the flight back home. I, Birat, personally felt that I could not be as free or unrestrained in Nepal as I was during my time in Belfast. No wonder a lot of the queer people we know opt for abroad.Seventeen years ago, when the Outburst Queer Arts Festival first began, it certainly was not as celebrated or large as it is now. What we are trying to convey here is that we do not have to start big. We can aim for something small yet promising. While there might be expectations to check all the boxes, it is crucial to be mindful of our capacity as well. But, we can be capacitated and this is where you – people in power, art enthusiasts, grant and resource allocators and media come in. It is time we all believe in Nepali queer art and create space for it to not only survive but thrive. It is imperative to understand that formulating our imagination into reality can only be possible through unwavering collaboration.",['santoshi shrestha win gold marathon debut'],"['represent imag photo tanushre rao unsplashwhil nation prepar festiv light , tihar earli novemb 2023 , someth less excit fuell spark ocean away .', 'queer art festiv happen seventeenth year chanc attend deleg .', 'deleg made possibl collabor outburst art , art organis base northern ireland , uk british council , nepal.ther clear distinct citi term flourish art scene , becam appar visit belfast , northern ireland , specif outburst queer art festiv held charm citi centr .', 'organis festiv requir month care prepar planning.th queer art festiv start short event last day .', ', 17 year , grown ten-day festiv panel discuss , theatr perform , exhibit .', 'program guid avail venu , partner hotel , local librari , shop .', 'mani deleg , includ us , came outsid northern ireland attend.dur queer art festiv , opportun connect art curat , publish , artist , repres british council depart around world ( lithuania , franc , south africa , turkey , greec , jordan , england , argentina name . )', 'event attend gave us differ insight art facilit connect .', 'gain insight queer publish art curat challeng face countri due resourc sometim bureaucraci system .', 'also got see way peopl thrive given platform showcas work , art exhibit artist reimagin intimaci queer people.on hand , nepal struggl larg time queer visibl .', 'explicit space sogiesc ( sexual orient , gender ident express sex characterist ) artist showcas work openli come togeth commun , exist pocket space .', 'way , someth struck us presenc older queer artist festiv .', 'one particular event queer art festiv .', 'notic activ particip involv older queer peopl throughout festiv .', 'fascin see queer artist 40 50 share transform inspir work .', 'wherea , back home , queer folk forefront queer art , advocaci activ mostli gen-z millenni .', 'queer elder count finger dilig work nepali queer folk .', 'even among , still hold onto archaic notion refus evolv embrac chang .', ', ’ that.from dream realitydur queer art festiv , opportun connect art curat , publish artist .', 'photo raphael renter | @ raphi_rawr unsplashbefor select deleg , us join onlin meet british council nepal outburst repres facilit kaalo 101 ( art space patan ) , along interest queer artist nepal .', 'total three meet discuss possibl challeng queer art festiv nepal .', 'discours also entail us share present updat queer art scene nepal last five year .', 'updat includ memor leap taken queer art music literatur fashion artist divers walk life .', 'day third meet , british council extend invit us attend outburst queer art festival.our deleg one exampl transcontinent collabor someth happen first time involv us .', ', outburst art british council practis cross-continent collabor year .', 'even year ’ festiv , wit lot artist differ contin work togeth exhibit , lectur , panel discuss , magazin .', 'amalgam introduc us brilliant thought-provok work defi gender sociopolit norm .', 'power transcontinent collabor beyond beautiful.imagin queer art nepalphoto nikola gannon unsplashth queer art scene nepal emerg one .', 'full-fledg festiv may possibl , someth small yet signific achiev .', 'time , differ organis run larg art exhibitions/tour week month .', 'howev , microcosm nepal , especi kathmandu , capit stranger art-ori program .', 'unfamiliar precis queer art .', 'unfamiliar someth induc lack queer artist art .', 'sadli , inadequ platform , space resourc pursu queer arts.despit , year event literatur emerg centr queer ident , come without challeng .', 'collect stori , “ pride climb higher ” “ song revolut ” showcas stori nepali across nepal .', 'mani stori reflect nepali queer experi otherwis .', 'june pride parad queer youth group gain momentum well past year sinc concept , small gather larg parad perform commun member .', 'said blue diamond societi ’ ( bd ) rainbow visibl pride event august festiv saa-paru ( gai jatra ) run well decad ;

Erroneous border pillar placement plagues Nepali farmers in Madhesh ,"The month of January saw major road accidents in different parts of the country, including Lamhi in Dang, Dhorpatan in Baglung, and Chandragiri in Kathmandu. Road accidents have been common throughout the country with Nepal Police data suggesting over 2,500 people dying in them annually. Despite this, the Ministry of Finance has shown reluctance to introduce the proposed Road Safety Bill to reduce traffic accidents, fatalities, and serious injuries, and enhance road safety. Instead, the Finance Ministry has asked the Ministry of Physical Infrastructure and Transport to include the proposed bill in the Public Roads Act. Along with that, the government’s initiative to pass dedicated laws on road safety and set up a mechanism, including the empowered National Road Safety Council (NRSC), to decrease accidents, has come to a halt.Keshav Kumar Sharma, secretary of the Ministry of Physical Infrastructure and Transport, says they asked for a dedicated road safety law that comprehensively addresses institutional arrangements was the need of the hour. This includes ensuring safety in road construction, promoting public awareness, providing training and communication facilities, implementing rescue mechanisms, and arranging rehabilitation for families affected by road accidents. However, the Ministry of Finance believes a separate law is unnecessary due to concerns about potential increased financial burden.Hourly needOfficials from the Ministry of Physical Infrastructure allege that the Ministry of Finance is approaching sensitive matters, such as passenger safety, solely from an economic standpoint. They say that concerns related to road, vehicle, and passenger safety are being overshadowed, and there are indications that this approach will continue. “The government is avoiding addressing the sensitive issue of road accidents and the associated human and material costs, fearing an increase in expenses. This contradicts the government’s commitment and policy to reduce traffic accidents in the future,” says an official from the Ministry of Physical Infrastructure on the condition of anonymity.According to the Ministry of Physical Infrastructure, the existing laws lack the vision and purpose necessary for developing a sustainable, safe, risk-free, and reliable transportation operation and security system. Therefore, the Ministry of Physical Infrastructure officials argue that a distinct law is essential to decrease road accidents and ensure the safety of pedestrians, including passenger transport workers and roadside residents, as well as pets, wild animals, and birds. “The Road Safety Act is the need of the hour as it will help us during post-accident rescue, treatment management, rehabilitation, and legal representation,” says the official.Currently, there are gaps in enforcing road rules, monitoring vehicle capacities, ensuring road structure safety, managing traffic signs, and organizing road safety facilities. The implementation of the Road Safety Act is seen as crucial to address these issues.However, there has not been a facilitative environment for providing education and raising awareness about road traffic safety, safety mechanisms, and coordinating among organisations related to road transport. The aspect of training drivers with skills and knowledge, as well as monitoring road safety on the roads, is also lacking. This is why experts have been suggesting introducing a separate road safety law to address these aspects.The Finance Ministry, however, says that road safety should not be downplayed by ignoring human sensibilities related to road safety and citing economic reasons. Officials from the Ministry of Physical Infrastructure argue that incorporating safety considerations in the Road Act does not automatically result in a decrease in accidents or the integration of post-accident rescue, relief, and rehabilitation efforts.“The existing laws do not address road safety anywhere. Due to its lack of clarity and inadequacy, it has not been implemented with due diligence. For instance, provisions such as those for vehicle inspectors outlined in the Transport Act have not been acted upon by the government,” says an official from the Transport Ministry.Policies and commitments, but no lawsThe Motor Vehicles and Transport Management Act (1993) includes several provisions related to vehicle registration, road permits, driver’s licenses, traffic management, insurance, and penalties. The Public Roads Act (1974) primarily focuses on road management. However, there is no provision in the Act regarding the National Road Safety Council.In this situation, Nepal has developed a 10-year road safety action plan but is yet to enact corresponding legislation. Unfortunately, government agencies and mechanisms are not obligated to follow the action plan, as it lacks legal guidance.Now, the Transport Ministry holds the view that if safety considerations are explicitly addressed in the Public Roads Act, the outcome will not differ from what the Finance Ministry has said. Given the Public Roads Act’s close association with the Department of Road, the ministry thinks greater emphasis will be placed on road construction. However, they argue that incorporating the road safety aspect into the Act would not be effective.Secretary Sharma of the Transport Ministry is tasked with ensuring road safety, overseeing physical infrastructure and transport, and coordinating efforts across education, health, home, law, federal affairs, and general administration ministries. This responsibility extends to provincial ministries, local levels, as well as various agencies, organisations, security agencies, non-governmental organisations, and related entities, each with their specific roles.“As all the agencies need to be allocated responsibilities for various aspects of road safety, we have requested them to collaborate in formulating a distinct law. This should encompass the reduction of all types of accidents,” said Sharma.The ministry believes that a dedicated law addressing road safety is crucial to mitigate severe road accidents in Nepal and to uphold the commitments made by the country on the international stage.Nepal has committed to implementing the Stockholm Declaration through the Global Road Traffic Safety Conference in 2020, as per the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. Nepal, which has incorporated sustainable development goals into its national development plan, has not yet commenced work aligned with these objectives.Nevertheless, Nepal’s neighbouring countries are already addressing road safety through legal frameworks. Various states in India have enacted road safety laws, and the effectiveness of these laws is contributing to a 50 per cent reduction in road accidents.In 1999, Bhutan also introduced a unified road safety and transport act. Pakistan, on the other hand, issued the National Highway Safety Ordinance-2000 to ensure road safety, distinct from its National Highway Authority Act (1991). Britain, Australia, America, New Zealand, and other countries have established separate road safety laws as well.Road safety neglectedIn Nepal, road safety has been consistently neglected due to the absence of dedicated legislation. Road safety expert Keshav Adhikari says that the government primarily focused on road construction, overlooks crucial aspects such as road safety and reinforcement. Consequently, roads are transforming into perilous pathways for both vehicles and passengers.“There is a lack of interest in formulating policies and laws aimed at mitigating financial losses resulting from accidents,” says Adhikari.He further points out that safety is not a governmental priority, as expanding the road network is perceived to yield more political benefits than implementing additional structures to enhance road safety.“When I worked as an expert in the Transport Ministry for over a year, I realised that promoting road safety is not a government priority,” he says. “Annually, more people die due to road accidents than those who die in natural disasters, but the government has not given it much attention.”Even though the prime minister, ministers, and MPs keep asserting that roads have been constructed, no one seems to be addressing the critical issues of road safety and quality.Saroj Sitaula, General Secretary of the Federation of Nepalese National Transport Entrepreneurs (FNNTE), says that the government must be attentive as accidents are on the rise due to various technical and human factors, including road infrastructure. “Many accidents can be mitigated by improving road conditions, installing barriers on the sides, putting up informational boards, and ensuring scientific and practical road markings,” he says. “We need to formulate a plan and progress accordingly.”Sitaula argues that the government should establish policies to create mechanisms for emergency rescue, treatment, and rehabilitation after an accident occurs. He emphasises the importance of enhancing road infrastructure, conducting a scientific examination of the technical condition of vehicles, and ensuring compliance with the law by drivers, passengers, and regulators. He says that blaming drivers and transport entrepreneurs for accidents is inadequate, and the government must fulfil its responsibilities.Roads are unsafeNepal currently boasts a road network spanning approximately 100,000 km, with the majority consisting of dirt and gravel roads. Among the more than 22,000 kilometres of national and subsidiary highways, numerous sections remain unpaved.Despite the government’s substantial investment in road construction and expansion, minimal efforts are allocated to ensuring road safety. Recently, all three levels of government have accelerated the widening of roads, incorporating asphalt and slopes. However, it appears that issues concerning road quality and safety are escalating at a faster pace. Roads that have been neglected in the guise of maintenance have become a nightmare for the public.Infrastructure expert Suryaraj Acharya notes that these problems arise due to the tendency to construct roads only after they have sustained damage, without considering potential issues during the initial construction phase.",['erron border pillar placement plagu nepali farmer

Nepal’s ‘low-altitude’ snow leopard would face big hurdles in return to wild ,"Realme 12 Pro+ 5G. Photo: Realme IndiaRealme has launched its popular mid-range number series smartphone, the Realme 12 Pro series. The series includes the Realme 12 Pro 5G and the Realme 12 Pro+ 5G which are the successors of the Realme 11 Pro+ 5G and Realme 11 Pro 5G respectively. The Realme 11 series was widely appreciated for its design and performance at the price range. The 12 series has stepped up the game with an even better design. Realme has not only changed the design but has also upgraded the performance and the camera to compete in the mid-range price market. Realme recently has been focusing a lot on the design aspect and the price range performance. The 12 Pro+ has some major differences from last year’s 11 Pro+ which include design, IP rating, chipset, camera and charging. Let us see what the luxuriously designed smartphone delivers in terms of specs.Specifications of Realme 12 Pro+ 5GDimensionsLength: 161.47mmWidth: 74.02mmDepth: 8.75mmWeight196 gramsDisplay typeAMOLEDDisplay size6.7-inchResolution2,412 x 1,080 (FHD+)Refresh rateUp to 120HzIP ratingIP65 dust and water resistance Glass Protection0.55mm Double-Reinforced GlassChipsetSnapdragon 7s Gen 2 (4nm)CPUOcta-core (4×2.40 GHz Cortex-A78 & 4×1.95 GHz Cortex-A55)GPUAdreno 710OSRealme UI 5.0 based on Android 14RAM8GB | 12GBStorage128GB | 256GBRear camera 50MP Sony IMX890 main camera8MP ultra-wide camera64MP periscope portrait cameraSelfie camera32MP Wi-Fi802.11 a/b/g/n/ac/ax（Wi-Fi 6）Bluetooth5.2NetworkLTE | 5GSIMDual Nano SIMAudioDual SpeakersSupports Dolby AtmosDual-mic Noise CancellationHi-Res Audio CertificationSensorsGeomagnetic sensor, Proximity sensor, Light sensor, Acceleration sensor, Gyroscope, In-display fingerprint sensorBattery5,000mAh (typ)Charging67W SUPERVOOC wired fast chargingPorts and Buttons2 Nano SIM Card SlotsType-C PortPower ButtonVolume ButtonsColoursSubmarine BlueNavigator BeigeExplorer RedPrice (expected)Rs 50,000 (8/128GB)Rs 54,000 (8/256GB)Rs 60,000 (12/256GB)Design and DisplayThe Realme 12 Pro+ and the Realme 12 Pro share the same design and dimensions. The design is fascinating. Realme patterned up with Luxury Swiss Watch designer Ollivier Savéo to craftfully design the smartphone. All the colour options have a vegan leather back. Since the phone is designed by a luxury watch designer, it comes with a big round camera module housing the triple camera setup.

"6 years on, the National Assembly has struggled to show its worth ","Ram Bujhaun Yadav with his land ownership certificate stands near a border pillar which he says was erroneously placed on his land. In October 2023, when 51-year-old Ram Bujhaun Yadav of Musaharnia Rural Municipality-5, Mukhiyapatti, Dhanusha, was at a relative’s house, someone told him that two Indian Sashastra Seema Bal (SSB) personnel were looking for him.Anxious, he rushed home wondering why they were looking for him.“They asked me if the paddy field in the no man’s land was mine. I told them yes and they asked me to cut down the paddy immediately,” he said.The paddy was not ripe and Yadav asked them for some time. However, the SSB personnel told him he had to cut down his paddy immediately.Ram Bujhaun and his wife Tetari Devi each own a 677-square-metre plot of land. As Nepal and India reevaluated the border, Ram Bujhan’s land was been deemed to be near the no man’s land as it now has two demarcation pillars.Frustrated, Ram Bujhaun cut the paddy before it was due to be harvested. Now, he has been asked to not plant anything on the land as it falls in the no man’s land.“Our border police don’t say a word. I can’t fight the SSB on my own,” says Ram Bujhaun adding he had decided not to plan anything on the land anymore.Woes of the farmersMany farmers in southern Nepal say their land has now been placed in India after the recent demarcation. When the Jamuna River, which flows through the no man’s land between Nepal and India, changed its course some two decades ago, some border pillars went missing. Locals say these pillars have now been placed encroaching on Nepali land.In 2018, with the then Chief District Officer of Dhanusha, Pradeep Raj Kandel, and an official from Madhubani district, Bihar, India, a team that included border security forces from both countries, the Armed Police Force of Nepal, and SSB of India began placing border pillars after land measurement by technicians.Locals have raised concerns, stating that border pillars have been positioned, encroaching approximately 50 to 100 meters of land into Nepal compared to the previous position. Many like Ram Bujhaun are unaware of when these border pillars were placed.“I did not know that pillar was placed here. After I found out when I asked the village leaders, many said they were placing the border pillars as they pleased,” said Ram Bujhaun.He was told to carry on planting paddy and that it would not matter as these issues had happened in the past. “They encroached on my land and have asked me not to plant anything. This is gross injustice,” he says.Ram Bujhaun’s family owns a total of 4,000 square metres of land, with 2,000 square metres belonging to him and the remaining 2,000 square metres to his brother Bechan. However, 1,000 square metres of his land is now located on the Indian side after the demarcation. Despite this, he has been farming on the land and continues to pay taxes to the Department of Land Management and Archive in Nepal.“They have marked my land to be on the Indian side and placed border pillars on it. I’ve been farming till now but I don’t know when they will ask me to stop,” he says.Ignorance of the governmentThe Madhesh province in southern NepalThe former ward chair of Mukhiyapatti Musharniya Rural Municipality-5, Ram Naresh Yadav, said that over time, India has encroached on numerous Nepali lands in various locations in the Madhesh Province. This, he says, happened due to the Nepali administration’s ignorance and weak stature.“They (Nepali administration) were careless and that meant the Indian side placed these border pillars by encroaching on Nepali land,” says Ram Naresh.He said that over 40 farmers from wards 1, 5, and 6 have land ranging from 300 to 1,600 square metres on the Indian side. “These farmers have land ownership certificates, but they cannot farm as the SSB says the land is in India and not Nepal,” said Ram Naresh.In 1996, land ownership certificates were distributed after surveying the land in the border area. Local Dharmendra Kumar Yadav said that since then, the locals have been paying their land tax regularly. In 2018, when the pillar was being placed, the locals protested when they saw their land was being encroached on. However, since the demarcation had been agreed upon by high-ranking government officials of Nepal and India, the farmer’s voices went unheard.“We tried to stop when the border pillars were being placed on our land. But the administrators from both sides forcibly put it there without even trying to hold a discussion,” said Harish Chandra Yadav. The Chief District Officer of Dhanusha, Chakrapani Pandey, says that the border pillars were placed by the technical team after the measurements and with the agreement of the high-ranking officials of the two countries.“The fields and houses that are built in no man’s land have recently been cleared. No one can do anything in this particular area,” said Pandey. “We understand the people’s concern but we cannot do anything about it now.”","['6 year , nation assembl struggl show worth']","['ram bujhaun yadav land ownership certif stand near border pillar say erron place land .', 'octob 2023 , 51-year-old ram bujhaun yadav musaharnia rural municipality-5 , mukhiyapatti , dhanusha , rel ’ hous , someon told two indian sashastra seema bal ( ssb ) personnel look him.anxi , rush home wonder look him . “ ask paddi field man ’ land mine .', 'told ye ask cut paddi immedi , ” said.th paddi ripe yadav ask time .', 'howev , ssb personnel told cut paddi immediately.ram bujhaun wife tetari devi 677-square-metr plot land .', 'nepal india reevalu border , ram bujhan ’ land deem near man ’ land two demarc pillars.frustr , ram bujhaun cut paddi due harvest .', ', ask plant anyth land fall man ’ land . “ border polic ’ say word .', '’ fight ssb , ” say ram bujhaun ad decid plan anyth land anymore.wo farmersmani farmer southern nepal say land place india recent demarc .', 'jamuna river , flow man ’ land nepal india , chang cours two decad ago , border pillar went miss .', 'local say pillar place encroach nepali land.in 2018 , chief district offic dhanusha , pradeep raj kandel , offici madhubani district , bihar , india , team includ border secur forc countri , arm polic forc nepal , ssb india began place border pillar land measur technicians.loc rais concern , state border pillar posit , encroach approxim 50 100 meter land nepal compar previou posit .', 'mani like ram bujhaun unawar border pillar place . “ know pillar place .', 'found ask villag leader , mani said place border pillar pleas , ” said ram bujhaun.h told carri plant paddi would matter issu happen past .', '“ encroach land ask plant anyth .', 'gross injustic , ” says.ram bujhaun ’ famili own total 4,000 squar metr land , 2,000 squar metr belong remain 2,000 squar metr brother bechan .', 'howev , 1,000 squar metr land locat indian side demarc .', 'despit , farm land continu pay tax depart land manag archiv nepal . “ mark land indian side place border pillar .', '’ farm till ’ know ask stop , ” says.ignor governmentth madhesh provinc southern nepalth former ward chair mukhiyapatti musharniya rural municipality-5 , ram naresh yadav , said time , india encroach numer nepali land variou locat madhesh provinc .', ', say , happen due nepali administr ’ ignor weak statur . “ ( nepali administr ) careless meant indian side place border pillar encroach nepali land , ” say ram naresh.h said 40 farmer ward 1 , 5 , 6 land rang 300 1,600 squar metr indian side .', '“ farmer land ownership certif , farm ssb say land india nepal , ” said ram naresh.in 1996 , land ownership certif distribut survey land border area .', 'local dharmendra kumar yadav said sinc , local pay land tax regularli .', '2018 , pillar place , local protest saw land encroach .', 'howev , sinc demarc agre upon high-rank govern offici nepal india , farmer ’ voic went unheard . “ tri stop border pillar place land .', 'administr side forcibl put without even tri hold discuss , ” said harish chandra yadav .', 'chief district offic dhanusha , chakrapani pandey , say border pillar place technic team measur agreement high-rank offici two countri . “ field hous built man ’ land recent clear .', 'one anyth particular area , ” said pandey .', '“ understand peopl ’ concern anyth . ”']"
Queer art festival: Reflecting and imagining the power of collaboration in Nepal ,"Photo by pippen on UnsplashLife is filled with surprises and unexpected events and it can change at any moment. The only thing certain in life is the uncertainty. Change is a natural and inevitable part of our lives, and it may be positive as well as negative.Even though it is not guaranteed that we will wake up in the morning, we set the alarm every night with the hope that we will wake up in the morning. We do not know what each day is going to bring us, but we may have varieties, adventures, and endless opportunities.The push to exploreThe uncertainty sometimes forces us to explore those aspects of life, we never knew existed or needed. It also tests the mental strength of people and how they deal with it. The uncertainty has taught me to be grateful, as we never know what life throws at us.In life, everything does not go according to our plans, and if we do not embrace the change we will face huge trouble. The Covid-19 pandemic is the best example of uncertainty, we were constantly fearing death and it was uncertain that we would see the sunrise the next day.It is not certain that every decision in life will be correct, but if you fear not trying at all, you miss endless opportunities for learning and growing. When our decisions or outcomes are on the negative side, we get depressed and we might tend to think about committing suicide, but we forget that if we have life we have endless opportunities. Most of us plan for our careers, our love life, etc. and when those plans do not work out we start getting uncomfortable. But if we can deal with today, we can surely deal with tomorrow. We need to cherish little moments in our lives and know that nothing is permanent not even the failures and setbacks.We come here with nothing and leave with nothing. So why should we hold the egos and grudges against each other? Instead of making our life meaningful and enjoying the journey of life, we get into puzzles of accumulating wealth and we go against our own loved ones for it. Change is certainPhoto by Kathyryn Tripp on UnsplashNothing is permanent in life, everything can change in fractions of seconds. In today’s society, everyone is so busy, that we people have so less time for our loved ones. What I have learned over the years, is to find time in our busy schedule for our family because we never know when it will be our last day together with them. Yes! Death is a natural process, so if you have to die someday, why should you die with grudges in your heart? But instead of worrying about the inevitable, focusing on the things you can control will bring a lot of happiness in life.Uncertainty is not only a negative thing; it also brings a lot of opportunity because you dare to change. The life-changing experience will not come knocking down your door, you need to expose yourself. We learn by doing and experimenting, even though we might fail. But that is not the end of the world. I still remember hesitating while applying for the role of leadership, at my school level as it was not certain that I would be chosen.Even after being selected, I was uncertain about whether I could fulfil my responsibilities or not. But that uncertainty helped me grow out of my comfort zone and give my best input. If I had not applied for that role just because I was uncertain of the outcome, I would miss the biggest learning opportunity in my school life. So, do not let the uncertainty or the unknown ever stop you from trying and no matter how much we try, to plan life always finds a way to surprise us. It is important to stay grounded when we have everything we wish for because life can take such a turn that we had never expected in our wildest dreams. Similarly, nothing is permanent in life, the financial hardships, the grades, the breakups, etc. But the most important thing is not to lose hope during those difficult times.According to the data provided by Nepal police, around 6,830 people took their lives in the fiscal year 2022/23. There is nothing in life that cannot be resolved although it may take time, committing suicide should not be an option. It’s important to share feelings among family members or loved ones because together as a family any problem can be overcome.Embrace the unknown and focus on enhancing your life, instead of worrying about what will happen next. Always find time for your loved ones, as life is uncertain. We should be grateful that we are alive and accept that change is the only constant thing in life. Do not let the unknown, stop you from trying or achieving your goals and always remember that even if you fail, you still have endless opportunities.",['queer art festiv : reflect imagin power collabor nepal'],"['photo pippen unsplashlif fill surpris unexpect event chang moment .', 'thing certain life uncertainti .', 'chang natur inevit part live , may posit well negative.even though guarante wake morn , set alarm everi night hope wake morn .', 'know day go bring us , may varieti , adventur , endless opportunities.th push exploreth uncertainti sometim forc us explor aspect life , never knew exist need .', 'also test mental strength peopl deal .', 'uncertainti taught grate , never know life throw us.in life , everyth go accord plan , embrac chang face huge troubl .', 'covid-19 pandem best exampl uncertainti , constantli fear death uncertain would see sunris next day.it certain everi decis life correct , fear tri , miss endless opportun learn grow .', 'decis outcom neg side , get depress might tend think commit suicid , forget life endless opportun .', 'us plan career , love life , etc .', 'plan work start get uncomfort .', 'deal today , sure deal tomorrow .', 'need cherish littl moment live know noth perman even failur setbacks.w come noth leav noth .', 'hold ego grudg ?', 'instead make life meaning enjoy journey life , get puzzl accumul wealth go love one .', 'chang certainphoto kathyryn tripp unsplashnoth perman life , everyth chang fraction second .', 'today ’ societi , everyon busi , peopl less time love one .', 'learn year , find time busi schedul famili never know last day togeth .', 'ye !', 'death natur process , die someday , die grudg heart ?', 'instead worri inevit , focus thing control bring lot happi life.uncertainti neg thing ; also bring lot opportun dare chang .', 'life-chang experi come knock door , need expos .', 'learn experi , even though might fail .', 'end world .', 'still rememb hesit appli role leadership , school level certain would chosen.even select , uncertain whether could fulfil respons .', 'uncertainti help grow comfort zone give best input .', 'appli role uncertain outcom , would miss biggest learn opportun school life .', ', let uncertainti unknown ever stop tri matter much tri , plan life alway find way surpris us .', 'import stay ground everyth wish life take turn never expect wildest dream .', 'similarli , noth perman life , financi hardship , grade , breakup , etc .', 'import thing lose hope difficult times.accord data provid nepal polic , around 6,830 peopl took live fiscal year 2022/23 .', 'noth life resolv although may take time , commit suicid option .', '’ import share feel among famili member love one togeth famili problem overcome.embrac unknown focu enhanc life , instead worri happen next .', 'alway find time love one , life uncertain .', 'grate aliv accept chang constant thing life .', 'let unknown , stop tri achiev goal alway rememb even fail , still endless opportun .']"

Don't Miss,"Arika Gurung in KathmanduFor 19 years, Arika Gurung’s story had not been told. No one knew who she was or what she looked like. However, over the last week or so, her name has echoed throughout the nation. On October 7, all her hard work paid off as she became the only Nepali athlete to win a silver medal in karate at the Asian Games this year. Arika Gurung is no stranger to the world of sports. The recently held 19th Asian Games marked her second international competition, with several domestic competitions also in her portfolio. What is interesting is that Gurung only made her international debut one-and-a-half weeks before the Asian Games in China.Her debut was quite memorable as she won a gold and a bronze medal at the 10th Shitoryu Karatedo International Championships after which she flew to China to compete in the Asian Games.She believes that her success and experience there also helped her to bag medals in China. “We identified our mistake during the competition in Indonesia,” she says, “By rectifying that error, we performed admirably in the Asian Games.”Win or learnArika Gurung after winning her bout in the Asian Games held in China.In the 68-kg weight category, there were a total of eight players including Gurung. Gurung started her bouts directly from the quarter-finals. Winning one fight ensured she would win a bronze medal, winning two fights secured a silver medal, and three victories would have resulted in a gold medal. Understanding this, she defeated Japanese player Yuzuki Sawae in her first fight and Hong Kong’s Yan Kai Ho in the semi-finals.Her final bout was against Sofya Berultseva from Kazakhstan, someone she had followed religiously. She was up against someone she had thoroughly studied in preparation for the match. However, she soon received a reality check when all the videos she had watched prior to the fight proved to be ineffective. She lost to the world champion and had to settle for a silver medal.“It was a great experience. I learnt a lot and will use that knowledge in future matches,” says Gurung.Arika Gurung in Kathmandu.Although her aim was to secure the gold, Gurung said she was disappointed in not being able to achieve this goal. “It is a bittersweet feeling,” says Gurung who is only the third athlete to win a silver medal for Nepal in the history of the Asian Games.Winning medals and hopesThis made her the talk of the town. While she anticipated celebrations in her village in Nilakantha municipality-13 in Dhading for her success, she was taken aback by the nationwide reaction to the news of her winning a silver medal.“I thought I had won one mere fight. But I didn’t know that there would be so much love and support from Nepal. Looking at it now, I am very lucky and happy. It is a proud moment for me.”But she feels that now the country as well as Nepali society, government and supporters’ hopes and expectations for her have increased. Therefore, she assures that she will improve her game and focus on bettering her game in the coming days.Her victory in the qualifiers earned her a spot in the Asian Games and introduced her to international competitions. This also led to her first participation in the national team’s closed training sessions.Under the guidance of coach Kushal Shrestha, she, along with other players, had been diligently preparing for the past nine months. “She is amazing. In the past nine months, she has not taken one day off. This medal is the reward for the hard work she has put in,” says Shrestha.Arika Gurung was the tallest athlete in the 68 kg weight category, and her height gave her an undoubted advantage. “Her arms and legs display remarkable agility, effortlessly moving without hesitation during the game,” says Shrestha.He also expressed his confidence in her abilities, expecting her to achieve a medal due to her diligence.“She is an exceptionally high-achieving individual. She has the potential to reach even greater heights, unfortunately, karate was removed from the Olympics,” he says.Although karate will not be part of the 2024 Olympics in Paris, Shrestha remains optimistic about its inclusion in the Olympics 2028. “If it is reintroduced later, we want to start preparing her for the Olympics 2028.”Proud motherAfter landing in Kathmandu, when Arika Gurung was busy giving interviews, her mother, Ratna, could be seen enthusiastically peeking from the background.Arika Gurung’s mother, Ratna.Holding a bouquet of flowers in hand that Arika Gurung received and witnessing the love her daughter was getting, Ratna was gleaming with happiness. Her father, who is a trekking guide, was not there to welcome her as he was in Phapla and there were no flights to bring him to Kathmandu.Her parents were often told to try for a son. But Ranta never game attention to that and believed that her two daughters were more than enough.“I always told Arika that she is as valuable as any son would be,” Ratna says.That has always given Arika Gurung the belief that she can do anything. Her mother says once Arika sets her mind on something, she has a tendency to see it through and achieve it no matter what. She even picked up hockey at an early age. It is a sport that she has deep affection for even to this day.The right timingArika Gurung’s coach Kushal ShresthaIn the past, Nepal had two separate federations for karate, causing uncertainty among players regarding their participation in international tournaments despite their year-round efforts and dedication.However, in January, the National Sports Council successfully mediated the conflict and amalgamated the two federations into a single entity. Following the election of the new leadership in March, the disputes within the karate community were effectively resolved.Former player and coach Shrestha highlighted it was a positive outcome, “Previously, players were often unsure about their participation. But with the new trajectory, players will no longer face such confusion and can solely concentrate on their games. This shift, undoubtedly, contributed to our confidence to win medals.”In the past, Nepal had secured three bronze medals in karate – Sita Rai in 1994, Samar Bahadur Gole in 1998, and Bimala Tamang in 2014.Although they had set their sights on securing three or four medals at the Asian Games, they are a bit disappointed about not achieving their target. Shrestha says insufficient exposure affected their performance against top-ranked opponents.  “The tie sheet also posed some challenge for us, as the players’ first match was scheduled against a top player,” Shrestha says.Regardless, coach Shrestha says that he views Arika Gurung’s recent success as a promising beginning for the Nepali karate sector. With enhanced exposure and opportunities, Nepali players will yield better results in upcoming tournaments.","[""n't miss""]","['arika gurung kathmandufor 19 year , arika gurung ’ stori told .', 'one knew look like .', 'howev , last week , name echo throughout nation .', 'octob 7 , hard work paid becam nepali athlet win silver medal karat asian game year .', 'arika gurung stranger world sport .', 'recent held 19th asian game mark second intern competit , sever domest competit also portfolio .', 'interest gurung made intern debut one-and-a-half week asian game china.h debut quit memor gold bronz medal 10th shitoryu karatedo intern championship flew china compet asian games.sh believ success experi also help bag medal china .', '“ identifi mistak competit indonesia , ” say , “ rectifi error , perform admir asian game . ” win learnarika gurung win bout asian game held china.in 68-kg weight categori , total eight player includ gurung .', 'gurung start bout directli quarter-fin .', 'win one fight ensur would win bronz medal , win two fight secur silver medal , three victori would result gold medal .', 'understand , defeat japanes player yuzuki sawa first fight hong kong ’ yan kai ho semi-finals.h final bout sofya berultseva kazakhstan , someon follow religi .', 'someon thoroughli studi prepar match .', 'howev , soon receiv realiti check video watch prior fight prove ineffect .', 'lost world champion settl silver medal . “ great experi .', 'learnt lot use knowledg futur match , ” say gurung.arika gurung kathmandu.although aim secur gold , gurung said disappoint abl achiev goal .', '“ bittersweet feel , ” say gurung third athlet win silver medal nepal histori asian games.win medal hopesthi made talk town .', 'anticip celebr villag nilakantha municipality-13 dhade success , taken aback nationwid reaction news win silver medal . “ thought one mere fight .', '’ know would much love support nepal .', 'look , lucki happi .', 'proud moment me . ” feel countri well nepali societi , govern support ’ hope expect increas .', 'therefor , assur improv game focu better game come days.her victori qualifi earn spot asian game introduc intern competit .', 'also led first particip nation team ’ close train sessions.und guidanc coach kushal shrestha , , along player , dilig prepar past nine month .', '“ amaz .', 'past nine month , taken one day .', 'medal reward hard work put , ” say shrestha.arika gurung tallest athlet 68 kg weight categori , height gave undoubt advantag .', '“ arm leg display remark agil , effortlessli move without hesit game , ” say shrestha.h also express confid abil , expect achiev medal due dilig . “ except high-achiev individu .', 'potenti reach even greater height , unfortun , karat remov olymp , ” says.although karat part 2024 olymp pari , shrestha remain optimist inclus olymp 2028 .', '“ reintroduc later , want start prepar olymp 2028 . ” proud motheraft land kathmandu , arika gurung busi give interview , mother , ratna , could seen enthusiast peek background.arika gurung ’ mother , ratna.hold bouquet flower hand arika gurung receiv wit love daughter get , ratna gleam happi .', 'father , trek guid , welcom phapla flight bring kathmandu.h parent often told tri son .', 'ranta never game attent believ two daughter enough . “ alway told arika valuabl son would , ” ratna says.that alway given arika gurung belief anyth .', 'mother say arika set mind someth , tendenc see achiev matter .', 'even pick hockey earli age .', 'sport deep affect even day.th right timingarika gurung ’ coach kushal shresthain past , nepal two separ feder karat , caus uncertainti among player regard particip intern tournament despit year-round effort dedication.howev , januari , nation sport council success mediat conflict amalgam two feder singl entiti .', 'follow elect new leadership march , disput within karat commun effect resolved.form player coach shrestha highlight posit outcom , “ previous , player often unsur particip .', 'new trajectori , player longer face confus sole concentr game .', 'shift , undoubtedli , contribut confid win medal . ” past , nepal secur three bronz medal karat – sita rai 1994 , samar bahadur gole 1998 , bimala tamang 2014.although set sight secur three four medal asian game , bit disappoint achiev target .', 'shrestha say insuffici exposur affect perform top-rank oppon .', '“ tie sheet also pose challeng us , player ’ first match schedul top player , ” shrestha says.regardless , coach shrestha say view arika gurung ’ recent success promis begin nepali karat sector .', 'enhanc exposur opportun , nepali player yield better result upcom tournament .']"

2023 Asian Games: Arika Gurung secures silver in karate,"The auction of the Nepal Super League (NSL) was full of new faces.Due to the ongoing player crisis in Nepali football, NSL, Nepal’s only franchise football league has seen a major facelift since its first edition back in 2021.Nine teams are taking part in this year’s edition after Biratnagar City FC pulled out of the tournament. Out of the nine marquee players for the 2023 edition, only three were marquee players in the first edition, highlighting the significant changes that have taken place since then.Bishal Shrestha, Bikesh Kuthu, and Anjan Bista are the sole marquee players from the inaugural edition. However, they have all switched teams from their 2021 affiliations, with Shrestha now representing FC Chitwan, Kuthu playing for Sporting Ilam FC de Mechi, and Bista joining Jhapa FC.The newly appointed marquee players include Ananta Tamang, Hishub Thapaliya, Aashish Chaudhary, Arik Bista, Ayush Ghalan, and Deep Karki. They will be representing Lalitpur City FC, Kathmandu Rayzrs, Dhangadhi FC, Butwal Lumbini FC, Pokhara Thunders, and Birgunj United FC, respectively.Ghalan made a significant impact in the 2021 edition after being discovered through a talent hunt organized by Pokhara Thunders. Thapaliya and Chaudhary, who showcased their skills in the recently concluded A Division League, are set to make their debut in the NSL.This year’s auction featured a total of 179 Nepali players, with 28 falling into Category A, 81 in Category B, and 70 in Category C. Out of this pool, 120 players were selected to join various teams, leaving 59 players unsold for the tournament.The second edition of the NSL will take place from November 25 onwards.Nepal Super League marquee players.Ilam going with experienceUnder the guidance of coach Meghraj KC, the newly formed team Sporting Ilam de Mechi, featuring a roster of seasoned players, is set to make their debut in the NSL. Former champion with Kathmandu Rayzrs, goalkeeper Bikesh Khutu will captain the team.Ilam will be bolstered by the presence of experienced players like former national team captain Biraj Maharjan, Bharat Khawas, Bimal Pandey, and Navin Lama.In their pursuit of strengthening the team, Ilam acquired Biraj Maharjan, Ashish Gurung and Navin Lama from the A category. Notably, Lama’s inclusion in the team was confirmed during the second round of selections. Among these three players, Gurung is a new addition, while the other two bring with them a wealth of experience.Jhapa on the attackJhapa will likely rely on its attack to try to win the NSL in its debut season. Anjan Bista serves as the marquee player for Jhapa. The team also boasts one of the most formidable lineups in this year’s NSL. This team appears to have achieved a balanced composition across midfield, forward, and defence.Laken Limbu was eagerly sought after by nine teams from the A category before ultimately being acquired by Jhapa. Prashant Laksam Limbu, who earned acclaim as a midfielder during the U19 SAFF Championship category, also found his way to Jhapa via a lucky draw. Defender Tsiring Lama made his way to Jhapa.Adding to their roster, Jhapa secured goalkeeper Anish Deula from Jawalakhel Youth Club. The team invested Rs 2.05 million to acquire 13 players from the auction. Among them, Jhapa selected 3 from Category A, 6 from Category B, and 4 from Category C.Youthful PokharaWith youngster Ayush Ghalan as their marquee player, Pokhara has decided to go with young players to take part in this year’s NSL. Coached by Nabin Neupane, Pokhara will be looking to run their opponents out of the park. They made significant strides in the auctions by securing 10 players even before the auction of the remaining 100 players concluded.Among their acquisitions, Pokhara has added defender Anjal Maharjan, midfielder Suraju Thakuri, and forward Sanjeev Bista.Lalitpur believes defence wins you titles‘Attack wins you games, defence wins you titles’. Believing in these famous words by Sir Alex Ferguson, Lalitpur City FC have built a team around the best defenders in the country.The marquee player Ananta Tamang will be alongside defenders Sanish Shrestha and Sesehang Angdembe. Dinesh Henjan will lead the line for Lalitpur who will rely on their defence to take them to the championship.Birgunj’s mixed bagBirgunj United is also debuting in the NSL this season and chose goalkeeper Deep Karki as their marquee player. The team has a young and talented midfield which will have Subas Gurung and Sudip Gurung. Forward Sunil Khadka will be tasked with scoring goals for the team along with a bunch of foreign players who will have to step up for them.Unlucky Butwal Lumbini FCButwal Lumbini FC was the unluckiest team in this year’s auction after losing out on players through the lucky draw. They were also forced to acquire two players from Category A in the second round. Nevertheless, the team maintains a balanced composition.Chitwan balanced approachChitwan FC had an indifferent auction. The team will rely on the leadership of Bishal Shreshta who is their marquee player. The team also has a balanced squad with a blend of both young and old players. Tsering Gurung, Simanta Thapa and Ekraj Budhathoki will strengthen the defence, while Utsav Rai will be their workhorse in midfield and Navayug Shrestha will lead the line.Strong DhangadhiIn the second edition of the NSL, Dhangadhi FC, led by their young player Ashish Chaudhary as the marquee, presents itself as a well-balanced team. Devendra Tamang, a dependable player for the national team, strengthens their defence.

An explosive hitting from Kushal Malla took Nepal to an impressive 212 in the allotted 20 overs.In reply, the Maldives did not look comfortable losing their first wicket in the second ball of the innings. Wickets continued to fall with Abinash Bohara taking three in a single over reducing Maldives to 16 for four. Bohara was the pick of the bowlers picking up six wickets. He was on a hat trick twice.

2023 Asian Games: Understrength India beat Nepal,"Kushal MallaKathmandu, September 27Nepal broke seven world records during their demolishing victory over Mongolia in the 19th Asian Games being held in Hangzhou.Here are the records Nepal broke during the victory:1. Highest scoreNepal scored 314 runs in the allotted 20 overs. This is the highest T20I score recorded so far. It is also the only 300-plus score recorded in T20 internationals.Afghanistan’s 278 against Ireland was the highest score prior to Nepal’s demolition of Mongolia on Wednesday in the Asian Games.2. Highest run rateWith Nepal scoring 314, the team also has the record for the highest run rate. Nepal scored the runs at 15.7 which again broke Afghanistan’s record against Ireland when they scored at 13.9.3. Sixes galoreScoring all those runs needed a lot of sixes and it was raining sixes in Hangzhou. Nepali batters, on course to score 314, hit 26 sixes. Kushal Malla hit 12 sixes, Dipendra Singh Airee hit eight and Rohit Paudel hit six. Compared to 26 sixes, Nepal only hit 14 fours.4. Fastest 100Kushal Malla was on a mission on Wednesday as he launched the ball all over the park. Malla’s 34-ball century surpassed David Miller’s 35-ball record against Bangladesh, showcasing exceptional power-hitting.Malla finished the game with an impressive score of 137 runs, marking it as the fifth-highest score ever recorded in a T20 international match.5. Fastest 50Dipendre Singh Airee made the most of some bellow-par bowling, sending almost all 10 balls he faced over the boundary. He hammered eight sixes, with six of them coming in his first six balls, scoring 50 in just nine balls. This stands as the fastest-recorded 50 in world cricket, a remarkable feat unlikely to be surpassed anytime soon.6. Highest strike rateAiree’s power hitting also gave him another record – the highest strike rate. Scoring 52 runs in 10 legal deliveries, Airee scored at a strike rate of 520.Previously, this record was held by Dwayne Smith of West Indies. On September 13, 2007, in a match against Bangladesh, he scored 29 runs off only 7 balls, boasting an extraordinary strike rate of 414.28.7. Margin of victoryBy defeating Mongolia by a margin of 273 runs, Nepal is now the record holder for the largest margin of victory in T20 International matches.

Asian Games 2023: Nepal reach the quarter-final after an easy victory over the Maldives,"As untouched and less discussed as the sports management industry is in Nepal, it has ample room to showcase creativity. Photo by Miguel Bruna on UnsplashIn 2023, Barbie named Women in Sports as their career of the year.Whenever I am out and about socially, there is always someone who seems pretty certain about not considering my profession as mainstream. Hold up! Sports as a career? In Nepal? You bet! This article aims to explain why women in this male-dominant sports industry in Nepal should not be viewed as a surprise.I have been part of the Nepali cricket industry in a private capacity for quite a while now. Armed with a Master’s Degree in IT from an American University, my choice to stick with sports management tends to raise eyebrows. While I am not an on-field player, I am definitely behind the scenes, playing strong games of serious deliverance with my team. We are all about creating what is not there.As untouched and less discussed as the sports management industry is in Nepal, it has ample room to showcase creativity. Being a commanding woman in a position can be challenging, but on the brighter side, the gender advantage has yet to fail me. As alien as I might be in sports management in Nepal, I have been accepted with open arms. The nature of the job is highly competitive, no doubt.Embraced by the sports fraternityPhoto: PixabayWomen in sports are safe, heard, and welcomed. I absolutely relish the addition of spirited women to the team. The nuances of sports are something women complement greatly. Sports management inherently rejects narrow minds. There is a lot of travelling, meeting people, experimenting, and remembering limitations. The adjustments are both trivial and clever. Often, in our part of the world, societal norms limit women from making career decisions, hindering them from living life on their terms. This restriction potentially keeps many capable women from pursuing the sports industry, where they could truly wield their power to make an impact. Change is gradual, and I hope to see numerous female faces in charge of stadiums someday in Nepal.Yes, there are challenges. It ranges from personal sacrifices to job security and opportunities. However, these are workable factors for any freelancer in sports management. The key is excelling at our jobs to thrive anywhere. Taking a page from the medical field, the seriousness we apply there should not differ in sports management. Sports is a powerful industry. Children grow up idolising what we showcase on TV. As glorious as the game is, it is every child’s dream to represent their country someday. Carrying that responsibility is our role in sports—an often thankless yet deeply satisfying job.Nepali sports industryThe fans went wild at TU Cricket Ground after Nepal beat UAE.Sports may be a smaller industry in Nepal, but globally, it is a behemoth. The world economy has shifted, and it is time we alter our perspective to recognise the potential of sports as an industry in Nepal. The idea of open commercialisation of sports remains somewhat unexplored, as it continues to be a more exclusive affair in Nepal. By sourcing innovative ideas, there’s a wealth of public attention and investment waiting to be tapped into, along with numerous practices to establish and discard. As the Nepali team achieves international records, the packaging of the sport becomes everything. There is plenty to learn from international sports management to make our industry highly marketable and poised for global entry.Sports such as cricket, football, volleyball, or even golf serve as key intersections for reshaping Nepal’s global narrative. Over the years, Kabaddi has witnessed a substantial surge in India, both in terms of viewership and commercial success. The primary challenge we grapple with is Nepal’s comparatively small market size, posing constraints on our ability to generate substantial economic gains. Therefore, there is unanimous agreement on the imperative for Nepal’s sports to venture onto the international stage.Nepal boasts many hardworking individuals, yet achieving this goal demands specialised talents in sports management with the requisite experience and the capacity to enhance existing values. In the long run, outsourcing such talents may foster dependence. Hence, a concerted effort is needed to inspire Nepali youth to engage in sports management, contributing to our sports ecosystem. There are various ways in which we can harness the potential of sports for our benefit. Encouraging youth involvement can be instrumental in capitalising on the multifaceted opportunities presented by the sports industry. There is a lot to explore if you think about it.",['asian game 2023 : nepal reach quarter-fin easi victori maldiv'],"['untouch less discuss sport manag industri nepal , ampl room showcas creativ .', 'photo miguel bruna unsplashin 2023 , barbi name women sport career year.whenev social , alway someon seem pretti certain consid profess mainstream .', 'hold !', 'sport career ?', 'nepal ?', 'bet !', 'articl aim explain women male-domin sport industri nepal view surprise.i part nepali cricket industri privat capac quit .', 'arm master ’ degre american univers , choic stick sport manag tend rais eyebrow .', 'on-field player , definit behind scene , play strong game seriou deliver team .', 'creat there.a untouch less discuss sport manag industri nepal , ampl room showcas creativ .', 'command woman posit challeng , brighter side , gender advantag yet fail .', 'alien might sport manag nepal , accept open arm .', 'natur job highli competit , doubt.embrac sport fraternityphoto : pixabaywomen sport safe , heard , welcom .', 'absolut relish addit spirit women team .', 'nuanc sport someth women complement greatli .', 'sport manag inher reject narrow mind .', 'lot travel , meet peopl , experi , rememb limit .', 'adjust trivial clever .', 'often , part world , societ norm limit women make career decis , hinder live life term .', 'restrict potenti keep mani capabl women pursu sport industri , could truli wield power make impact .', 'chang gradual , hope see numer femal face charg stadium someday nepal.y , challeng .', 'rang person sacrific job secur opportun .', 'howev , workabl factor freelanc sport manag .', 'key excel job thrive anywher .', 'take page medic field , serious appli differ sport manag .', 'sport power industri .', 'children grow idolis showcas tv .', 'gloriou game , everi child ’ dream repres countri someday .', 'carri respons role sports—an often thankless yet deepli satisfi job.nepali sport industryth fan went wild tu cricket ground nepal beat uae.sport may smaller industri nepal , global , behemoth .', 'world economi shift , time alter perspect recognis potenti sport industri nepal .', 'idea open commercialis sport remain somewhat unexplor , continu exclus affair nepal .', 'sourc innov idea , ’ wealth public attent invest wait tap , along numer practic establish discard .', 'nepali team achiev intern record , packag sport becom everyth .', 'plenti learn intern sport manag make industri highli market pois global entry.sport cricket , footbal , volleybal , even golf serv key intersect reshap nepal ’ global narr .', 'year , kabaddi wit substanti surg india , term viewership commerci success .', 'primari challeng grappl nepal ’ compar small market size , pose constraint abil gener substanti econom gain .', 'therefor , unanim agreement imper nepal ’ sport ventur onto intern stage.nep boast mani hardwork individu , yet achiev goal demand specialis talent sport manag requisit experi capac enhanc exist valu .', 'long run , outsourc talent may foster depend .', 'henc , concert effort need inspir nepali youth engag sport manag , contribut sport ecosystem .', 'variou way har potenti sport benefit .', 'encourag youth involv instrument capitalis multifacet opportun present sport industri .', 'lot explor think .']"
Asian Games 2023: PUB-G team reaches the semi-final,"Painting ‘My Private Life’ by artist Priyam Pradhan at the exhibition Mani at Siddhartha Art Gallery, Baber Mahal. Photo: Chandra Bahadur AleUsing Pitt’s artist pen on paper, artist Priyam Pradhan presents My Private Life, a showcase of the current significance of his life depicted in abstract form.At the centre of the painting is a 1000-rupee note, within which Pradhan has intricately painted Lord Krishna, a man wearing a hoodie tenderly embracing his dog, and a woman. The woman stands tall, elongated in form. Towards the bottom of the canvas, a holy man reaches out his hands, appearing to be in flight.Priyam Pradhan has used a vibrant colour palette, incorporating bright hues such as pink, orange, and yellow, as well as green, black, white, and grey. This combination adds a dynamic and lively quality to the artwork.“The man in the centre is me and the girl in green is my girlfriend. And the faces are my mom and dad,” says Pradhan. “The sadhu (holy man) symbolises my desires that I don’t have many desires for materialistic things however I do understand the value of money.”The use of colours, figures and lines in an abstract form in his painting resembles the painting of American painter Paul Jackson Pollock. Like his abstract expressionism, Pradhan has expressed himself in his painting.Furthermore, this marks Priyam Pradhan’s third solo painting exhibition titled Mani (money), inaugurated on January 17 at Siddhartha Art Gallery, Baber Mahal.In his previous exhibitions, Pradhan’s artworks centred around Hindu philosophy and his spontaneous thought process. However, in this latest exhibition, he explores the theme of money and its impact on an individual’s life, delving into the reverberating effects of financial aspects.Understanding the value of moneyPaintings by artist Priyam Pradhan at Siddhartha Art Gallery, Baber Mahal. Photo: Chandra Bahadur AleAny form of art is known as a reflection of the contemporary time. Likewise, Priyam Pradhan’s paintings reflect the lifestyle, desires, obligations and more of today’s younger generation living in urban areas in Nepal.Pradhan himself is in his 20s and he has justified the want of most of the youngsters in their 20s, who might be declared adults and understand the need for money and materialistic things but are still kids at their heart who want to explore and experience life as much as possible.The exhibition has 27 paintings which Pradhan took around nine months to complete. According to him, while he was travelling the idea that his life was luxurious and him being capable of exploring anything he wanted to was because of money.And being an artist this concept lingered on him and he was compelled to create on the theme of money.Once you enter the gallery, you can also view an animated video, which introduces artist Pradhan and the importance of money, which is on the ground floor. On the first floor, a huge painting (193×62 in cm) Apatkalin Awastha using mixed media on canvas welcomes you and other paintings are small in size (18×30 in cm).“It is a team work and it is my introduction as an artist for the exhibition,” he says. “Also, being a recent multimedia graduate from Islington College, I wanted to explore my skills and I got my team. Then, like money, multimedia is relevant to current society.”Experiencing life through artPainting by artist Priyam Pradhan at Siddhartha Art Gallery, Baber Mahal. Photo: Chandra Bahadur Ale Priyam Pradhan says enjoyment is the meaning of life and he enjoys creating artwork. Moreover, Pradhan who came into the art world first being a tattoo artist feels blessed that he has the privilege to explore whatever he likes in his life.He also believes that the philosophy that says one should not be materialistic is wrong. “If material things are not important, why would one build a house? And after building a house why do they want to decorate their house?” he questions.Alongside, money and materialistic things, his paintings also explore love, romance, life and childhood experiences. Motifs like Pokemon, ramen noodles, animals, dancers, etc have been used in his paintings. In most of his paintings, he has used numerous white lines in wavy form and these lines for Pradhan indicate the sound or the energy that exists in the surroundings all the time.About using a pitta artist pen, he says, “I have enjoyed drawing and painting since my childhood and using a pitta artist pen helps me revisit that feeling of happiness and sense of freedom.”So many things happening on the canvas with the use of vibrant colours gives a sense of excitement to the viewers. Though referencing artists like Pollock, MF Husain, Picasso and more, his pen strokes give a sense of newness through his expression and thoughts about his life experiences.In his paintings, these bright colours and motifs are in harmony and are visual treats that can surely cheer up the mood of any visitor.

U19 SAFF Championship: Heartbreak for Nepal after losing to India on penalties,"Entrepreneurship education is not just an investment in the education system; it is an investment in the nation’s future prosperity. Photo: Pexels/ Rodnae ProductionsIn the shadow of the towering Himalayas, Nepal faces a challenge that rivals the steepness of its mountainous terrain- the challenge of economic development. As the nation earnestly pursues its Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), it becomes increasingly evident that a transformation in the education system is not only necessary but also urgent. Rooted in common living strategies, the prevailing education model, especially in higher education, may not adequately prepare the youth for the demands of the modern world. In this critical juncture, the incorporation of entrepreneurship education emerges as a beacon of hope, offering a pathway towards a self-reliant and prosperous Nepal.Time to reevaluate the education systemNepal’s journey towards economic prosperity has been marked by challenges that demand innovative solutions. The commitment of the SDGs reflects not only a global responsibility but also a domestic imperative for sustainable development. For this, it is high time to reevaluate the education system in the country.The current education system in Nepal, deeply entrenched in common living strategies, has been the foundation of learning for generations. However, in the face of a rapidly evolving world, today’s generation aspires for more than the status quo. The call for independence reverberates through the aspirations of youth who seek a curriculum fostering critical thinking, innovation and entrepreneurial skills.Entrepreneurship education is a dynamic force capable of reshaping Nepal’s educational landscape. This innovative approach moves beyond traditional learning methods, providing students with the tools to navigate the complexities of the modern world. At its core, entrepreneurship education is about empowering students to implement learned information in practical and tangible ways.Consider a student engrossed in the intricacies of sensor systems during a science class, entrepreneurship education transforms this theoretical knowledge into practical applications, inspiring the creation of a sensor-operated door. Such innovation born from a fusion of science and entrepreneurship becomes a valuable mindset in solving practical problems.  Expanding the horizons of entrepreneurship education, let us delve into chemistry. Imagine students studying chemistry not just as a theoretical subject, but also as entrepreneurs in the making. Armed with entrepreneurial principles, these students can tap into Nepal’s rich biodiversity, exploring market demands for products derived from local plants.In the scenario, chemistry students could embark on a journey to develop performance-enhancing products based on market demand, harnessing the potential of indigenous flora. What makes this approach remarkable is that it does not necessarily require sophisticated machines or extensive human resources. Instead, it leverages the inherent skills and awareness of individuals within the community, paving the way for a grassroots economic revolution.Entrepreneurship in education Representational graphic. Image: FreepikThe beauty of entrepreneurship education lies in its universal applicability. It is not confined to science or chemistry alone. Consider an art student, for example. Through entrepreneurship education, they can understand what art to develop (product), how much to set the price (price), where to sell (place) and how to sell (promote) their artworks. Every subject becomes a canvas for innovation and enterprise.Moreover, entrepreneurship education is a powerful equaliser, recognising the unique skills and talents of individuals across various disciplines. It is not about fitting into a predefined mould but rather about unleashing the potential within each student. When every single person is aware of their skills and potential, they can rise to different levels, contributing to the overall progress of the nation.Entrepreneurship education goes beyond skill recognition; it is about nurturing the ability to produce goods and mastering the art of marketing. Returning to the example of the student developing a sensor-operated door, entrepreneurship education not only equips them to produce the product but also teaches them how to navigate the complexities of marketing it to potential users and clients.The impact of entrepreneurship education extends beyond individual success stories; it reverberates through the entire nation. A generation equipped with entrepreneurial skills becomes a driving force for economic growth and independence. They will be able to recognise the resources and ideas to utilise them to reach the global market. They will be able to be the pioneers in products and contribute to the economy. By fostering a culture of innovation, creativity and self-reliance, Nepal can reduce its dependence on external sources and strengthen its economy from within.In essence, entrepreneurship education is not just an investment in the education system; it is an investment in the nation’s future prosperity. It is a transformative force that has the potential to shape a generation of independent thinkers, innovators and entrepreneurs- the architects of a self-reliant and economically vibrant Nepal. Entrepreneurship education, by teaching students to utilise available resources (physical and financial) and make them commercial, becomes a cornerstone in the nation’s journey towards economic empowerment and independence.",['u19 saff championship : heartbreak nepal lose india penalti'],"['entrepreneurship educ invest educ system ; invest nation ’ futur prosper .', 'photo : pexels/ rodna productionsin shadow tower himalaya , nepal face challeng rival steep mountain terrain- challeng econom develop .', 'nation earnestli pursu sustain develop goal ( sdg ) , becom increasingli evid transform educ system necessari also urgent .', 'root common live strategi , prevail educ model , especi higher educ , may adequ prepar youth demand modern world .', 'critic junctur , incorpor entrepreneurship educ emerg beacon hope , offer pathway toward self-reli prosper nepal.tim reevalu educ systemnep ’ journey toward econom prosper mark challeng demand innov solut .', 'commit sdg reflect global respons also domest imper sustain develop .', ', high time reevalu educ system country.th current educ system nepal , deepli entrench common live strategi , foundat learn gener .', 'howev , face rapidli evolv world , today ’ gener aspir statu quo .', 'call independ reverber aspir youth seek curriculum foster critic think , innov entrepreneuri skills.entrepreneurship educ dynam forc capabl reshap nepal ’ educ landscap .', 'innov approach move beyond tradit learn method , provid student tool navig complex modern world .', 'core , entrepreneurship educ empow student implement learn inform practic tangibl ways.consid student engross intricaci sensor system scienc class , entrepreneurship educ transform theoret knowledg practic applic , inspir creation sensor-oper door .', 'innov born fusion scienc entrepreneurship becom valuabl mindset solv practic problem .', 'expand horizon entrepreneurship educ , let us delv chemistri .', 'imagin student studi chemistri theoret subject , also entrepreneur make .', 'arm entrepreneuri principl , student tap nepal ’ rich biodivers , explor market demand product deriv local plants.in scenario , chemistri student could embark journey develop performance-enhanc product base market demand , har potenti indigen flora .', 'make approach remark necessarili requir sophist machin extens human resourc .', 'instead , leverag inher skill awar individu within commun , pave way grassroot econom revolution.entrepreneurship educ represent graphic .', 'imag : freepikth beauti entrepreneurship educ lie univers applic .', 'confin scienc chemistri alon .', 'consid art student , exampl .', 'entrepreneurship educ , understand art develop ( product ) , much set price ( price ) , sell ( place ) sell ( promot ) artwork .', 'everi subject becom canva innov enterprise.moreov , entrepreneurship educ power equalis , recognis uniqu skill talent individu across variou disciplin .', 'fit predefin mould rather unleash potenti within student .', 'everi singl person awar skill potenti , rise differ level , contribut overal progress nation.entrepreneurship educ goe beyond skill recognit ; nurtur abil produc good master art market .', 'return exampl student develop sensor-oper door , entrepreneurship educ equip produc product also teach navig complex market potenti user clients.th impact entrepreneurship educ extend beyond individu success stori ; reverber entir nation .', 'gener equip entrepreneuri skill becom drive forc econom growth independ .', 'abl recognis resourc idea utilis reach global market .', 'abl pioneer product contribut economi .', 'foster cultur innov , creativ self-reli , nepal reduc depend extern sourc strengthen economi within.in essenc , entrepreneurship educ invest educ system ; invest nation ’ futur prosper .', 'transform forc potenti shape gener independ thinker , innov entrepreneurs- architect self-reli econom vibrant nepal .', 'entrepreneurship educ , teach student utilis avail resourc ( physic financi ) make commerci , becom cornerston nation ’ journey toward econom empower independ .']"

Sandeep Lamichhane off to China to take part in the Asian Games,"Ram Bujhaun Yadav with his land ownership certificate stands near a border pillar which he says was erroneously placed on his land. In October 2023, when 51-year-old Ram Bujhaun Yadav of Musaharnia Rural Municipality-5, Mukhiyapatti, Dhanusha, was at a relative’s house, someone told him that two Indian Sashastra Seema Bal (SSB) personnel were looking for him.Anxious, he rushed home wondering why they were looking for him.“They asked me if the paddy field in the no man’s land was mine. I told them yes and they asked me to cut down the paddy immediately,” he said.The paddy was not ripe and Yadav asked them for some time. However, the SSB personnel told him he had to cut down his paddy immediately.Ram Bujhaun and his wife Tetari Devi each own a 677-square-metre plot of land. As Nepal and India reevaluated the border, Ram Bujhan’s land was been deemed to be near the no man’s land as it now has two demarcation pillars.Frustrated, Ram Bujhaun cut the paddy before it was due to be harvested. Now, he has been asked to not plant anything on the land as it falls in the no man’s land.“Our border police don’t say a word. I can’t fight the SSB on my own,” says Ram Bujhaun adding he had decided not to plan anything on the land anymore.Woes of the farmersMany farmers in southern Nepal say their land has now been placed in India after the recent demarcation. When the Jamuna River, which flows through the no man’s land between Nepal and India, changed its course some two decades ago, some border pillars went missing. Locals say these pillars have now been placed encroaching on Nepali land.In 2018, with the then Chief District Officer of Dhanusha, Pradeep Raj Kandel, and an official from Madhubani district, Bihar, India, a team that included border security forces from both countries, the Armed Police Force of Nepal, and SSB of India began placing border pillars after land measurement by technicians.Locals have raised concerns, stating that border pillars have been positioned, encroaching approximately 50 to 100 meters of land into Nepal compared to the previous position. Many like Ram Bujhaun are unaware of when these border pillars were placed.“I did not know that pillar was placed here. After I found out when I asked the village leaders, many said they were placing the border pillars as they pleased,” said Ram Bujhaun.He was told to carry on planting paddy and that it would not matter as these issues had happened in the past. “They encroached on my land and have asked me not to plant anything. This is gross injustice,” he says.Ram Bujhaun’s family owns a total of 4,000 square metres of land, with 2,000 square metres belonging to him and the remaining 2,000 square metres to his brother Bechan. However, 1,000 square metres of his land is now located on the Indian side after the demarcation. Despite this, he has been farming on the land and continues to pay taxes to the Department of Land Management and Archive in Nepal.“They have marked my land to be on the Indian side and placed border pillars on it. I’ve been farming till now but I don’t know when they will ask me to stop,” he says.Ignorance of the governmentThe Madhesh province in southern NepalThe former ward chair of Mukhiyapatti Musharniya Rural Municipality-5, Ram Naresh Yadav, said that over time, India has encroached on numerous Nepali lands in various locations in the Madhesh Province. This, he says, happened due to the Nepali administration’s ignorance and weak stature.“They (Nepali administration) were careless and that meant the Indian side placed these border pillars by encroaching on Nepali land,” says Ram Naresh.He said that over 40 farmers from wards 1, 5, and 6 have land ranging from 300 to 1,600 square metres on the Indian side. “These farmers have land ownership certificates, but they cannot farm as the SSB says the land is in India and not Nepal,” said Ram Naresh.In 1996, land ownership certificates were distributed after surveying the land in the border area. Local Dharmendra Kumar Yadav said that since then, the locals have been paying their land tax regularly. In 2018, when the pillar was being placed, the locals protested when they saw their land was being encroached on. However, since the demarcation had been agreed upon by high-ranking government officials of Nepal and India, the farmer’s voices went unheard.“We tried to stop when the border pillars were being placed on our land. But the administrators from both sides forcibly put it there without even trying to hold a discussion,” said Harish Chandra Yadav. The Chief District Officer of Dhanusha, Chakrapani Pandey, says that the border pillars were placed by the technical team after the measurements and with the agreement of the high-ranking officials of the two countries.“The fields and houses that are built in no man’s land have recently been cleared. No one can do anything in this particular area,” said Pandey. “We understand the people’s concern but we cannot do anything about it now.”",['sandeep lamichhan china take part asian game'],"['ram bujhaun yadav land ownership certif stand near border pillar say erron place land .', 'octob 2023 , 51-year-old ram bujhaun yadav musaharnia rural municipality-5 , mukhiyapatti , dhanusha , rel ’ hous , someon told two indian sashastra seema bal ( ssb ) personnel look him.anxi , rush home wonder look him . “ ask paddi field man ’ land mine .', 'told ye ask cut paddi immedi , ” said.th paddi ripe yadav ask time .', 'howev , ssb personnel told cut paddi immediately.ram bujhaun wife tetari devi 677-square-metr plot land .', 'nepal india reevalu border , ram bujhan ’ land deem near man ’ land two demarc pillars.frustr , ram bujhaun cut paddi due harvest .', ', ask plant anyth land fall man ’ land . “ border polic ’ say word .', '’ fight ssb , ” say ram bujhaun ad decid plan anyth land anymore.wo farmersmani farmer southern nepal say land place india recent demarc .', 'jamuna river , flow man ’ land nepal india , chang cours two decad ago , border pillar went miss .', 'local say pillar place encroach nepali land.in 2018 , chief district offic dhanusha , pradeep raj kandel , offici madhubani district , bihar , india , team includ border secur forc countri , arm polic forc nepal , ssb india began place border pillar land measur technicians.loc rais concern , state border pillar posit , encroach approxim 50 100 meter land nepal compar previou posit .', 'mani like ram bujhaun unawar border pillar place . “ know pillar place .', 'found ask villag leader , mani said place border pillar pleas , ” said ram bujhaun.h told carri plant paddi would matter issu happen past .', '“ encroach land ask plant anyth .', 'gross injustic , ” says.ram bujhaun ’ famili own total 4,000 squar metr land , 2,000 squar metr belong remain 2,000 squar metr brother bechan .', 'howev , 1,000 squar metr land locat indian side demarc .', 'despit , farm land continu pay tax depart land manag archiv nepal . “ mark land indian side place border pillar .', '’ farm till ’ know ask stop , ” says.ignor governmentth madhesh provinc southern nepalth former ward chair mukhiyapatti musharniya rural municipality-5 , ram naresh yadav , said time , india encroach numer nepali land variou locat madhesh provinc .', ', say , happen due nepali administr ’ ignor weak statur . “ ( nepali administr ) careless meant indian side place border pillar encroach nepali land , ” say ram naresh.h said 40 farmer ward 1 , 5 , 6 land rang 300 1,600 squar metr indian side .', '“ farmer land ownership certif , farm ssb say land india nepal , ” said ram naresh.in 1996 , land ownership certif distribut survey land border area .', 'local dharmendra kumar yadav said sinc , local pay land tax regularli .', '2018 , pillar place , local protest saw land encroach .', 'howev , sinc demarc agre upon high-rank govern offici nepal india , farmer ’ voic went unheard . “ tri stop border pillar place land .', 'administr side forcibl put without even tri hold discuss , ” said harish chandra yadav .', 'chief district offic dhanusha , chakrapani pandey , say border pillar place technic team measur agreement high-rank offici two countri . “ field hous built man ’ land recent clear .', 'one anyth particular area , ” said pandey .', '“ understand peopl ’ concern anyth . ”']"
Posts navigation,"Regenerative braking representational image. Photo: FreepikThe electric vehicle market in Nepal has grown significantly over the past year. Electric four-wheelers and two-wheelers are being launched almost every month, spanning from passenger to commercial vehicles. Electric transportation appears to be an emerging trend in the automotive industry.New EVs are regularly introduced with advanced features as car companies develop unique electric platforms. One standout feature is regenerative braking.Regenerative braking was first introduced in 1967 by the American Motor Car Company (AMC) in their prototype electric vehicle, the AMC Amitron. However, Toyota became the automobile manufacturer to implement regenerative braking system (RBS) technology in their Prius series hybrid vehicles in 1997. Toyota brought up the new hybrid technology in the Prius when fuel prices were going up at a massive rate. 1997 Toyota Prius Hybrid. Photo: ToyotaBut what is regenerative braking? There are still many people confused about what it is, whether it is safe or helpful in fuel economy in hybrid cars and the regeneration of electricity in electric cars.In simple terms, regen braking is when a car saves energy by recharging its battery when you brake, helping it use less fuel or electricity and go further. Easy but scientifically, regen braking is a process used in vehicles where the kinetic energy produced during braking is converted into electrical energy through an electric motor acting as a generator. This electrical energy is then stored in the vehicle’s battery for later use, reducing energy wastage and increasing overall efficiency.Photo: FreepikRegen braking can be seen in all kinds of EVs, including cars, scooters, commercial vans, buses, bicycles, three-wheelers, and rickshaws. It now can be electrically managed to what extent the power and braking can be generated. Regenerative Braking work process in EVPrinciple of Operation: Regene braking works by turning the energy from slowing down into electricity.Electric Motor as a Generator: In EV or hybrid cars with regen braking, the motor changes roles from moving the car to making electricity when you brake.Switching Polarity: When you brake, the motor switches directions, turning energy from the wheels into electricity instead of using it to move the car.Generation of Electricity: The turning wheels make the motor produce electricity, which goes to the car’s battery.Power Electronics: Special electronics change the electricity from the motor into the right kind for charging the battery.Battery Charging: The electricity made during braking charges up the car’s battery, storing the energy for later.Integration with Hydraulic Braking System: Regenerative braking works with the regular brakes, blending them for smooth stopping.Photo: automotive-iqAdvantages and Disadvantages of Regenerative Braking The advantages are listed below:Energy Efficiency: Regenerative braking efficiently captures the kinetic energy generated during braking, effectively reducing energy wastage and contributing to a more sustainable driving experience.Extended Range: By using the energy that would otherwise be lost during braking as heat and sound, regenerative braking helps to extend the driving range of electric vehicles in instances such as travelling downhill. Reduced Brake Wear: Regenerative braking minimizes the strain on traditional braking components, mitigating wear and tear, and potentially extending the lifespan of the braking components such as brake pads, rotors and brake lines, thus reducing maintenance costs over time.Enhanced Driving Experience: Regenerative braking provides a smoother braking experience and a more responsive feel to drivers, enhancing overall driving comfort and control on the road.The disadvantages are listed below:Limited Effectiveness at Low Speeds: While regenerative braking efficiently recaptures energy during braking, its effectiveness diminishes at lower speeds which leads to decreased energy recovery compared to higher speeds.Complexity and Cost: Implementing regenerative braking adds complexity and cost to vehicle systems, potentially raising manufacturing and maintenance expenses, and impacting consumer affordability.Maintenance Requirements: Regenerative braking systems require periodic maintenance and calibration to ensure they operate optimally.Efficiency Variability: Regenerative braking may exhibit variability in efficiency under extreme weather conditions or on certain road surfaces, leading to fluctuations in overall energy recapture and impacting the vehicle’s efficiency.MisconceptionsFully Recharges Battery: Some mistakenly believe that regenerative braking fully replenishes the battery, but in reality, it only adds a modest amount of charge.Increases Braking Distances: There is a misconception that regenerative braking extends braking distances, but it enhances braking performance by complementing traditional brakes.High-Speed Only: While more effective at higher speeds, regenerative braking still functions at lower speeds, such as during city driving or stop-and-go traffic.Maintenance-Free: Despite requiring less maintenance than traditional brakes, regen braking systems still need periodic checks and maintenance to ensure proper operation.Significantly Boosts Range: While regen braking contributes to extending the driving range of electric vehicles, its impact is influenced by various factors beyond just braking efficiency.Only for Electric Cars: Although commonly associated with electric vehicles, regen braking systems are also found in some conventional vehicles, particularly those aiming to improve fuel efficiency with advanced technology.Photo: FreepikRegenerative braking might sound complicated, but it is pretty cool. Think of it as a way for EVs and hybrids to recycle energy when they slow down. Instead of just wasting that energy, regenerative braking turns it into electricity, which can then be used to power the battery.",['post navig'],"['regen brake represent imag .', 'photo : freepikth electr vehicl market nepal grown significantli past year .', 'electr four-wheel two-wheel launch almost everi month , span passeng commerci vehicl .', 'electr transport appear emerg trend automot industry.new ev regularli introduc advanc featur car compani develop uniqu electr platform .', 'one standout featur regen braking.regen brake first introduc 1967 american motor car compani ( amc ) prototyp electr vehicl , amc amitron .', 'howev , toyota becam automobil manufactur implement regen brake system ( rb ) technolog priu seri hybrid vehicl 1997 .', 'toyota brought new hybrid technolog priu fuel price go massiv rate .', '1997 toyota priu hybrid .', 'photo : toyotabut regen brake ?', 'still mani peopl confus , whether safe help fuel economi hybrid car regener electr electr cars.in simpl term , regen brake car save energi recharg batteri brake , help use less fuel electr go .', 'easi scientif , regen brake process use vehicl kinet energi produc brake convert electr energi electr motor act gener .', 'electr energi store vehicl ’ batteri later use , reduc energi wastag increas overal efficiency.photo : freepikregen brake seen kind ev , includ car , scooter , commerci van , buse , bicycl , three-wheel , rickshaw .', 'electr manag extent power brake gener .', 'regen brake work process evprincipl oper : regen brake work turn energi slow electricity.electr motor gener : ev hybrid car regen brake , motor chang role move car make electr brake.switch polar : brake , motor switch direct , turn energi wheel electr instead use move car.gener electr : turn wheel make motor produc electr , goe car ’ battery.pow electron : special electron chang electr motor right kind charg battery.batteri charg : electr made brake charg car ’ batteri , store energi later.integr hydraul brake system : regen brake work regular brake , blend smooth stopping.photo : automotive-iqadvantag disadvantag regen brake advantag list : energi effici : regen brake effici captur kinet energi gener brake , effect reduc energi wastag contribut sustain drive experience.extend rang : use energi would otherwis lost brake heat sound , regen brake help extend drive rang electr vehicl instanc travel downhil .', 'reduc brake wear : regen brake minim strain tradit brake compon , mitig wear tear , potenti extend lifespan brake compon brake pad , rotor brake line , thu reduc mainten cost time.enhanc drive experi : regen brake provid smoother brake experi respons feel driver , enhanc overal drive comfort control road.th disadvantag list : limit effect low speed : regen brake effici recaptur energi brake , effect diminish lower speed lead decreas energi recoveri compar higher speeds.complex cost : implement regen brake add complex cost vehicl system , potenti rais manufactur mainten expens , impact consum affordability.mainten requir : regen brake system requir period mainten calibr ensur oper optimally.effici variabl : regen brake may exhibit variabl effici extrem weather condit certain road surfac , lead fluctuat overal energi recaptur impact vehicl ’ efficiency.misconceptions recharg batteri : mistakenli believ regen brake fulli replenish batteri , realiti , add modest amount charge.increas brake distanc : misconcept regen brake extend brake distanc , enhanc brake perform complement tradit brakes.high-spe : effect higher speed , regen brake still function lower speed , citi drive stop-and-go traffic.maintenance-fre : despit requir less mainten tradit brake , regen brake system still need period check mainten ensur proper operation.significantli boost rang : regen brake contribut extend drive rang electr vehicl , impact influenc variou factor beyond brake efficiency.onli electr car : although commonli associ electr vehicl , regen brake system also found convent vehicl , particularli aim improv fuel effici advanc technology.photo : freepikregen brake might sound complic , pretti cool .', 'think way ev hybrid recycl energi slow .', 'instead wast energi , regen brake turn electr , use power batteri .']"

But in the gush of excitement to take exclusive photographs of the elusive cat, difficult to spot even in its prime habitats, there were few takers for the word of caution.Nepal’s Department of National Parks and Wildlife Conservation (DNPWC) organised the photo-op two days after the male subadult cat, which was until recently found in the country only at altitudes higher than 2,000-6,000 metres above sea level, was brought to the zoo from Urlabari town(146 m above sea level). According to the department, the animal has sustained injuries to its right foreleg and cannot stand upright.Although officials involved said they are looking at releasing the animal into the wild after it recuperates, doing so will be a daunting task, adding that the zoo may be the only place where it can now survive.Not a wild catReporters and photojournalists take photos of a snow leopard being held at the Central Zoo in Lalitpur, Nepal. Image by Abhaya Raj Joshi/ Mongabay“Nepali snow leopard experts have come up with two hypotheses to explain how the animal from the mountains landed up in the plains,” said Sharad Chandra Adhikari, member-secretary at the National Trust for Nature Conservation (NTNC), a semi-government body that manages the zoo in Lalitpur, a town in the Kathmandu Valley. The first of the two hypotheses made public during the photo-op-cum-press conference, is that it was raised in captivity and somehow managed to escape into the wild. The second is that it lost its orientation while trying to establish its territory after separating from its mother.Kulbhushansingh Suryawanshi, director of the India program, Snow Leopard Trust, said that both hypotheses are plausible explanations as to how the snow leopard got to the plains in Nepal.A DNPWC official, who wished to remain anonymous as he is not authorised to talk to the press, said that it was more likely that the animal had been raised in captivity. “The way it sipped the water and ate the food zoo staff offered indicates that it may have been raised in captivity,” the official said.Snow leopards are shy cats living at extreme altitudes in the steep mountainous areas of 12 countries in Central and South Asia. Their global population spread over altitudes of 500-5,800 m, is estimated to be between around 3,900 and 6,000 as detailed coordinated surveys of the population in the range countries are yet to be carried out. In Nepal, their population divided into three blocks (eastern, central and western) is estimated to be between 301 and 400.Adhikari from NTNC said that researchers will now examine the animal’s scat to analyse its diet and try to find out whether it was roaming in the wild or had been in some sort of captivity. Researchers are also preparing to analyse its genes to try to find out to which of the three metapopulations in Nepal it belongs. They will also observe the animal’s canine teeth and fur to look for clues.Relocation challenge A snow leopard found in Urlabari town in Nepal’s plains in a cage at the Central Zoo in Kathmandu. Photo: Aryan DhimalThe whole process could take a few months to complete, and summer could set in in Kathmandu by then, officials concede. “The current temperature in Kathmandu is suitable for snow leopards, as we are in the peak of winter,” said Madhu Chetri, a snow leopard researcher from NTNC. But that could change as spring season begins in the Northern Hemisphere.The DNPWC official said that regardless of the findings related to how the animal got to Urlabarli, the animal would have spent a significant amount of time with humans during its recovery phase. “That would mean that it would have gotten habituated with having humans around,” the official said.Sending such animals back into the wild is a challenge, as they may have lost their hunting and other adaptation skills, he added. In May last year, officials at the Chitwan National Park released two rescued rhino calves into the wild, with limited success. The safety of the animals, which had gotten used to having humans around, was compromised as poachers could easily approach and kill them. Eventually, they were transferred to an enclosure in eastern Nepal away from human intervention.Veteran conservationist Professor Karan Bahadur Shah said that rewilding the snow leopard would be a daunting task, as the animals are territorial. “If we just leave the animal in its natural habitat, it will get killed by other snow leopards defending their territory,” he said. “The best option would be to keep the animal in the zoo for the public to see.”But Nepal’s Central Zoo has its own set of problems. The facility, established in 1932 as a private collection, has limited space and has frequently run into financial trouble. Conservationists say the snow leopard would need special facilities to cater to its needs.“If the government decides that the snow leopard needs to remain at the zoo, we are ready to shoulder the responsibility,” said Adhikari. “We have set up special facilities for animals such as the red panda and chimpanzees,” he said. “We can do that for the snow leopard as well.”Those advocating for keeping the animal in the zoo also said that Nepal is a snow leopard range country and the public, especially the young generation, also needs to see the different animals found in the country. “It has great educational value,” said Shah.Snow leopard expert Suryawanshi from neighbouring India also said that it would be challenging to release the animal into the wild. “If the team at the zoo can establish the exact cause of this behaviour [why it ventured into the plains] and can keep the animal away from human contact, then it might be okay to release it back,” he said. “But otherwise, there is little hope for it in the wild. Better to let it live in the zoo.”Back at the zoo, after the photojournalists are done taking photos, it is the turn of the reporters to point their smartphones at the animal. Then there is a contingent of senior wildlife department officials waiting in line to catch a glimpse of the animal. “So much for keeping it away from human contact,” a conservationist observing the hullabaloo from a distance said.This story first appeared on Mongabay and Onlinekhabar is republishing it under a Creative Commons licence.",['women sport manag make differ'],"['snow leopard rescu urlabari current kept central zoo lalitpur .', 'photo : aryan dhimala gate vet clinic central zoo lalitpur open , two dozen photojournalist throng facil surround metal cage aim dslr camera snow leopard insid . “ pleas ’ come close anim , ” zoo ’ vet , radha krishna gharti , told approach photojournalist .', 'gush excit take exclus photograph elus cat , difficult spot even prime habitat , taker word caution.nep ’ depart nation park wildlif conserv ( dnpwc ) organis photo-op two day male subadult cat , recent found countri altitud higher 2,000-6,000 metr sea level , brought zoo urlabari town ( 146 sea level ) .', 'accord depart , anim sustain injuri right foreleg stand upright.although offici involv said look releas anim wild recuper , daunt task , ad zoo may place survive.not wild catreport photojournalist take photo snow leopard held central zoo lalitpur , nepal .', 'imag abhaya raj joshi/ mongabay “ nepali snow leopard expert come two hypothes explain anim mountain land plain , ” said sharad chandra adhikari , member-secretari nation trust natur conserv ( ntnc ) , semi-govern bodi manag zoo lalitpur , town kathmandu valley .', 'first two hypothes made public photo-op-cum-press confer , rais captiv somehow manag escap wild .', 'second lost orient tri establish territori separ mother.kulbhushansingh suryawanshi , director india program , snow leopard trust , said hypothes plausibl explan snow leopard got plain nepal.a dnpwc offici , wish remain anonym authoris talk press , said like anim rais captiv .', '“ way sip water ate food zoo staff offer indic may rais captiv , ” offici said.snow leopard shi cat live extrem altitud steep mountain area 12 countri central south asia .', 'global popul spread altitud 500-5,800 , estim around 3,900 6,000 detail coordin survey popul rang countri yet carri .', 'nepal , popul divid three block ( eastern , central western ) estim 301 400.adhikari ntnc said research examin anim ’ scat analys diet tri find whether roam wild sort captiv .', 'research also prepar analys gene tri find three metapopul nepal belong .', 'also observ anim ’ canin teeth fur look clues.reloc challeng snow leopard found urlabari town nepal ’ plain cage central zoo kathmandu .', 'photo : aryan dhimalth whole process could take month complet , summer could set kathmandu , offici conced .', '“ current temperatur kathmandu suitabl snow leopard , peak winter , ” said madhu chetri , snow leopard research ntnc .', 'could chang spring season begin northern hemisphere.th dnpwc offici said regardless find relat anim got urlabarli , anim would spent signific amount time human recoveri phase .', '“ would mean would gotten habitu human around , ” offici said.send anim back wild challeng , may lost hunt adapt skill , ad .', 'may last year , offici chitwan nation park releas two rescu rhino calv wild , limit success .', 'safeti anim , gotten use human around , compromis poacher could easili approach kill .', 'eventu , transfer enclosur eastern nepal away human intervention.veteran conservationist professor karan bahadur shah said rewild snow leopard would daunt task , anim territori .', '“ leav anim natur habitat , get kill snow leopard defend territori , ” said .', '“ best option would keep anim zoo public see . ” nepal ’ central zoo set problem .', 'facil , establish 1932 privat collect , limit space frequent run financi troubl .', 'conservationist say snow leopard would need special facil cater need . “ govern decid snow leopard need remain zoo , readi shoulder respons , ” said adhikari .', '“ set special facil anim red panda chimpanze , ” said .', '“ snow leopard well . ” advoc keep anim zoo also said nepal snow leopard rang countri public , especi young gener , also need see differ anim found countri .', '“ great educ valu , ” said shah.snow leopard expert suryawanshi neighbour india also said would challeng releas anim wild .', '“ team zoo establish exact caus behaviour [ ventur plain ] keep anim away human contact , might okay releas back , ” said .', '“ otherwis , littl hope wild .', 'better let live zoo . ” back zoo , photojournalist done take photo , turn report point smartphon anim .', 'conting senior wildlif depart offici wait line catch glimps anim .', '“ much keep away human contact , ” conservationist observ hullabaloo distanc said.thi stori first appear mongabay onlinekhabar republish creativ common licenc .']"
Priyam Pradhan explores the essence of money and life in ‘Mani’ ,"The National Assembly was formed to give experienced people a chance to be part of the parliament and help during the formation of important bills. In countries that follow the Westminster model of government, the upper house plays an important role. That, however, is not the case in Nepal as the country’s upper house has become a platform where individuals secure positions in the National Assembly based on their connections. As the election nears, many once again question the relevance and existence of the upper house.Things were different in the past as the initial years of the National Assembly saw experienced politicians and experts others in their field be nominated for the post. That slowly changed as the first batch completed its two-year term.“I understand why people are frustrated with the upper house. People expected experts but all we got was party cadres who lacked knowledge or experience,” says Bimala Rai Paudyal a National Assembly member. “Considering such behaviour and practices, what distinguishes the House of Representatives from the National Assembly?”A loser’s second chance Narayan Kaji Shrestha, who faced defeat in the 2017 general election from Gorkha-2, was elected as a member of the National Assembly on January 23, 2020. Elected from Gandaki Province, Shrestha currently is the Deputy Prime Minister and Home Minister of the country.Bhagwati Neupane who lost the election from Gandaki province and Bimala Ghimire who lost the election for mayorship in Bhanu Municipality also shared the same trajectory.Similarly, Mrigendra Kumar Singh Yadav and Jag Prasad Sharma were defeated in the House of Representatives elections, from Saptari-4 and Dang-3 respectively are now members of the National Assembly. Bam Dev Gautam, who lost the elections from Bardiya, secured a place in the upper house through nomination by President Bidya Devi Bhandari.Even those who did not win as ward member(s) got the opportunity to become members of the National Assembly including Sindh Bahadur Bishwakarma who was appointed on February 7, 2018. He is soon leaving his post on March 3.Despite the repeated criticisms, the political parties have not paid attention to this concern posed by political leaders and the general public. The latest proof of this is the list of candidates for the National Assembly elections scheduled on January 25. The list contains names like Krishna Prasad Sitaula, defeated in the House of Representatives elections in 2022 from Koshi Province, and Pooja Chaudhary, who lost in the provincial assembly elections 2022 from Rautahat-3 (a).Speaker Ganesh Prasad Timilsina, who led the National Assembly for the entire six years under the federal system, is also dissatisfied with the individuals who have made it to the upper house. “The allegations are something for the parties to ponder upon. The leaders should have prioritised involving intellectuals/neutrals rather than managing its members,” he says.The 59-member National Assembly elects eight representatives, equally from all seven provinces, with an additional three individuals nominated by the President. The Constitution ensures representation of women, Dalits, minorities or disabled communities, envisioning that experts, experienced individuals, and the most qualified people from various fields will become members of the National Assembly.Easy way inFile: A National Assembly meetingThere are some reasons why leaders aspire to join the upper house, and even the leadership create opportunities for them. In National Assembly elections, voters consist of local-level heads/deputy heads and provincial assembly members. Typically, individuals seeking these positions undergo a vetting process by their respective parties. As a result, aspiring members of parliament can focus less on persuading individual voters and more on gaining party support to secure their candidacy. Moreover, being a member of the National Assembly opens avenues to ministerial roles. The constitution prohibits a National Assembly member from becoming the Prime Minister, but not Deputy Prime Minister. Due to such opportunities, leaders are enticed to seek a position in the assembly.The National Assembly is currently in its fourth election cycle since the promulgation of the Consitution in 2015. Scheduled for January 25, this election aims to fill 19 seats vacated by individuals completing their six-year terms. The previous election cycles took place in 2017, involving 56 members, followed by 2019 with 18 positions, and 2020 with 19 positions.The cascading impactsFile: A National Assembly meetingAnother reason why the National Assembly is finding it difficult to justify itself is that it has become a shadow of the House of Representatives. The meeting of the National Assembly did not have one session when the House of Representatives was dissolved by then Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli twice. The demands and issues raised by the opposition parties in the House of Representatives automatically went to the National Assembly, where the parliamentarians of the ruling party put forward any proposal, they endorse it the same as in the House of Representatives.The latest example – is the main opposition UML did not allow the meeting of the House of Representatives to continue for five days from July 5, 2023, due to a statement made by Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal during his visit to India. Consequently, the meeting of the National Assembly was also paused during that period.The UML obstructed the House of Representatives for almost a month starting mid-July last year demanding a high-level inquiry committee to probe the 60-kilogram gold smuggling case and the resignation of the Home Minister. The National Assembly followed suit with leaders pushing their agendas forward.Speaker Ganesh Timilsina himself is dissatisfied that every behaviour and activity of the House of Representatives influence the National Assembly. He says despite his attempts to prevent the overshadowing, it has been unfortunate that he did not garner the goodwill of the top leaders during political disputes.Reinstating powerThe National Assembly is a permanent institution. Therefore, it can remain operational even in the absence of the House of Representatives. Under normal circumstances, Speaker Timilsina initiated a positive practice by personally participating in different committees. Nevertheless, in the absence of the House of Representatives, the National Assembly often experienced inactivity.In December 2020, the Prime Minister at that time, KP Sharma Oli, dissolved the House of Representatives. Subsequently, a session of the National Assembly was convened on January 1, 2021. Despite lasting only seven hours over four days, this session, which took place after the dissolution, failed to address crucial public issues. Even after six months, important matters remained unaddressed within the House.On May 22, 2021, the UML-led government once again dissolved the House of Representatives. The meeting of the National Assembly and committees was affected once more. However, the dissolutions were declared unconstitutional by the Supreme Court, reinstating the parliament.The Constitution says that despite the closing of the National Assembly session, thematic committee meetings can still take place. However, both the National Assembly and its committees remained inactive until the restoration of the House of Representatives.According to Khimlal Devkota, a member of the National Assembly, when the House of Representatives was dissolved twice, it seemed that the National Assembly was also in a state of dissolution.Bimala Rai Paudyal also believes that the inability to resume the upper house is a mark of weakness. “Since the government was not in a position to call, the President needed to be consulted by the chair together with the consultation committee. That was not done either,” she says.Constitutional and legal distinctionsExcept for the Constitution of Nepal (1962) and the Interim Constitution of Nepal (2007), all other constitutions in Nepal provided for a bicameral parliament with the National Assembly or the Upper House and the House of Representatives or the Lower House. The practices before 2015 were under the unitary governance system, but after the adoption of the federal democratic republican governance system, the role of the National Assembly has changed somewhat.In the preamble of the constitution prepared by the ‘Constituent Assembly, and Administrative Organ Designation Committee’ during the drafting of the constitution, it is mentioned that some different qualifications have been prescribed for being a member of the House of Representatives and the National Assembly, with the intention that qualified people can be represented in the National Assembly.Chair of the National Assembly Ganesh Prasad Timilsina restates that the members of the upper house should be assessed based on the country’s expectations with clear criteria. There is no definite definition of an expert in the constitution. It has been stated symbolically, “…It is expected that the members should have some basic skills to face the challenges and fulfil their responsibilities.”According to the constitution, the responsibility of the National Assembly is to correctly establish the rights of the local level, state, and union, and to prevent the House of Representatives from trying to enact laws contrary to the spirit of federalism. There is an explanatory comment in the constitution about the propriety of the National Assembly – “This House is expected to fulfil its role to maintain creative and mutual relations between the national government and the provinces.”In addition, there are some constitutional and legal differences regarding the National Assembly. But the MPs are demanding that it should cease. When a bill originating in the House of Representatives is passed and sent to the National Assembly, and if the latter does not decide within 60 days, it proceeds de facto.This has placed the National Assembly in a dilemma. The Chairman of the National Assembly, Timilsina, says, “Such an arrangement should also apply to the House of Representatives, or both should be equal.”Need for course correction PM Pushpa Kamal Dahal speaking in the National Assembly meeting.Some instances have turned these so-called experts into a laughing stock due to their actions. On July 5, 2023,  a discussion on the Electronic Commerce (E-Commerce) Bill 2023 was tabled in the National Assembly. However, the parliamentarians misunderstood the main point and instead discussed the matter of electricity. The MPs, who had not read the proposal, suggested that electricity consumption within Nepal should also be increased besides exporting electricity to India and Bangladesh.During the meeting, Ramesh Rijal, the Minister of Industry, Commerce and Supplies, also mentioned that India would purchase electricity during the Prime Minister’s visit. Unfortunately, the bill was unanimously approved.Timilsina considers the incident an example, that in his six-year tenure, he does not want to remember. Som Bahadur Thapa, a former secretary at the Parliament Secretariat, termed the incident ‘a joke’ in the Parliament of Nepal. “This is strong proof of the kind of MPs we have, who speak without knowing what they are talking about.” Timilsina assumed the role of the speaker/chair of the National Assembly after the establishment of the Federal Democratic Republic. He had the opportunity to establish the system and the dignity of the National Assembly. However, instead of setting a positive example, he will soon be retiring after being accused of playing tricks with the Speaker and showing interest in the work of the House of Representatives.Timilsina has repeatedly commented on the affairs of the House of Representatives. The latest instance was during a seminar on ‘Japan: Past, Present, and Future’ held in the capital on December 2, 2023, he publicly stated that the election results of the House of Representatives did not bode well.Pointing to the emergence of a new party and the victory of some independent candidates, he said, “In a democracy, you get to choose candidates, irrespective of their party affiliation. However, is the signal positive?”In August/ September 2022, Timilsina wrote a letter to the Election Commission, urging them to extend the tenure of Speaker and Deputy Speaker. Upon receiving a response stating that the Commission would not determine the tenure of the elected Parliament, Timilsina directed the Parliament Secretariat not to execute decisions made by the Management Committee after September 17, 2022.This created conflict between the Speaker of the House of Representatives and the Speaker of the National Assembly and in the crux of this dispute between the parties, the country had to bear the consequences of this conflict. Laws could not be enacted promptly, and the place once considered the domain of experts was overshadowed by the party’s interest. A study conducted by the Democracy Resource Center Nepal (DRCN) on the legislative functioning of the National Assembly has revealed that the Upper House has passed some bills that go against the spirit of federalism.The report’s concluding remarks say, “…the bills passed by the House of Representatives have not undergone significant changes or discussions in the National Assembly. The conclusion section of the study states that – “Furthermore, some bills, contradicting the spirit of federalism and addressing the interests of interest groups, have been approved by the National Assembly.”Overall, in the last six years, parties have introduced individuals who, given their presentation level, have raised questions about the National Assembly’s justification. If there are no changes in the constitution, laws, and policies concerning the upper assembly, these concerns will persist.”",['priyam pradhan explor essenc money life ‘ mani ’'],"['nation assembl

Role of entrepreneurship education in Nepal’s quest for economic empowerment ,"Representational image Photo by Tanushree Rao on UnsplashWhile most of the nation was preparing for the festival of lights, Tihar in early November 2023, something no less exciting was fuelling our sparks from oceans away. A queer art festival was happening for the seventeenth year and we had a chance to attend it as delegates. Our delegation was made possible through the collaboration between the Outburst Arts, an art organisation based in Northern Ireland, UK and the British Council, Nepal.There is a clear distinction between cities in terms of their flourishing arts scenes, and this became apparent during a visit to Belfast, Northern Ireland, specifically for the Outburst Queer Arts Festival held in the charming city centre. The organisation of such a festival requires months of careful preparation and planning.The queer art festival started as short events lasting a few days. Now, after 17 years, it has grown into a ten-day festival with panel discussions, theatre performances, and exhibitions. Program guides were available at venues, partner hotels, local libraries, and shops. Many delegates, including us, came from outside Northern Ireland to attend.During the queer art festival, we had the opportunity to connect with art curators, publishers, artists, and representatives from other British Council departments around the world (Lithuania, France, South Africa, Turkey, Greece, Jordan, England, and Argentina to name a few.) Each event that we attended gave us a different insight into what the arts can do and how it can facilitate connections. We gained insights from queer publishers and art curators on the challenges they face in their own countries due to resources and sometimes from bureaucracy in systems. We also got to see the way people can thrive when given a platform to showcase their works, such as an art exhibition in which the artist reimagined intimacy for queer people.On the other hand, Nepal struggles by and large at times for queer visibility. There are no explicit spaces for SOGIESC (Sexual Orientation, Gender Identity and Expressions and Sex Characteristics) artists to showcase their works nor openly come together as a community, it all exists in pocket spaces. In the same way, something that struck us was the presence of older queer artists at the festival. It was not just for one particular event during the queer art festival. We noticed an active participation and involvement of older queer people throughout the festival there. It was fascinating to see queer artists in their 40s and 50s share their transformative and inspiring work. Whereas, back home, the queer folks at the forefront of queer art, advocacy and activism are mostly Gen-Zs and millennials. We have very few queer elders that we can count on our fingers who are diligently working for Nepali queer folks. Even among them, some still hold onto archaic notions and refuse to evolve and embrace changes. So, there’s that.From dream to realityDuring the queer art festival, we had the opportunity to connect with art curators, publishers and artists. Photo by Raphael Renter | @raphi_rawr on UnsplashBefore being selected as delegates, both of us joined online meetings with British Council Nepal and the Outburst representatives facilitated through Kaalo 101 (an art space in Patan), along with interested queer artists from Nepal. We had a total of three meetings where we discussed the possibilities and challenges of doing a queer art festival in Nepal. The discourse also entailed us sharing a presentation about the updates of the queer art scene in Nepal in the last five years. The updates included memorable leaps taken in queer arts from music to literature and fashion and more by artists from diverse walks of life. Days after the third meeting, the British Council extended invitations to us to attend the Outburst Queer Arts Festival.Our delegation is just one example of the transcontinental collaboration because it was something that happened for the first time and involved us. But, Outburst Arts and the British Council have been practising cross-continental collaboration for years. Even in this year’s festival, we witnessed a lot of artists from different continents work together in exhibitions, lectures, panel discussions, magazines and so on. The amalgamation introduced us to brilliant thought-provoking work that defies gender and sociopolitical norms. The power of transcontinental collaboration was beyond beautiful.Imagining queer arts in NepalPhoto by Nikolas Gannon on UnsplashThe queer art scene in Nepal is an emerging one. While a full-fledged festival may not be possible now, something small yet significant is achievable. Time and again, different organisations have been running large art exhibitions/tours for weeks and months. However, in the microcosm that is Nepal, especially Kathmandu, the capital is no stranger to art-oriented programs. What it has been unfamiliar with precisely is queer art. And the unfamiliarity is not something induced by the lack of queer artists and their art. Sadly, it is because of inadequate platforms, space and resources to pursue queer arts.Despite this, through the years there have been events and literature that have emerged centring on queer identity, but it has not come without its challenges. On collections of stories, “Pride Climbing Higher” and “Songs of Revolution” showcase stories from Nepalis across Nepal. There are not many stories reflecting the Nepali queer experiences otherwise. June Pride Parade by Queer Youth Group has gained momentum as well in the past few years since its conception, from a small gathering to now a large parade with performances from community members. The same can be said about Blue Diamond Society’s (BDS) Rainbow Visibility Pride events in August during the festival of Saa-Paru (Gai Jatra) which has been running for well over a decade; in recent years they have included flash mobs and interaction programmes as well in lead up to their parade. Individuals within the community have also organised their queer gatherings with friends, thus coming back to the cosmos of pocket spaces in celebrating queerness.While artists like us are creative with what we want to put out, we still need organisations like the British Council to foster spaces and connections to enable us to do that. Then and again, artists have come together and collaborated on queer-centric projects. But, we need funding and resources to achieve bigger-scale projects that unite more artists and transcend borders.Both of us advocate for queer rights and are involved in programs and activities that push the narrative further, extend the visibility of the community and normalise conversations surrounding queerness. Among other things, we are also the founders of Queering The Bond, a networking collective for Nepali queer folks and Shuby is also the founder of Queer Honky-Tonk, a platform to promote queer performances and networking with events such as a drag show or open mic every few months. However, both of us, individually or collaboratively can only do so much. The challenges of living in a capitalistic world oftentimes outweigh the passion we have for the queer art scene in Nepal. And this is where we expect the government and organisations to step up with policies, platforms and programs to provide spaces, opportunities and resources for queer artists. Here, the British Council joined hands with Outburst Arts, which paved the way for our delegation. We would not have known about the marvellous queer art festival at the other end of the world otherwise.Besides the limitations brought by insufficient spaces and social unawareness, the centralised capital does hinder queer artists from outside the city to connect, create and collaborate. Art already is centralised and elitist. On top of that, the concentrated Kathmandu Valley is of no help when it comes to making art accessible beyond its borders.Furthermore, there is also the expectation from basically everyone to have the perfect festival that caters to all people’s needs and wants. While the festival, if it should happen, is bound to be done with the right intentions, there is a lot of pressure for the first-time event itself. The festival will be inclusive and diverse. But, realistically speaking, it would be a struggle to make it relevant to each queer person from east to west.Speaking of struggles, a visceral feeling of uneasiness swarmed over me with each step I took while exiting the airport after the flight back home. I, Birat, personally felt that I could not be as free or unrestrained in Nepal as I was during my time in Belfast. No wonder a lot of the queer people we know opt for abroad.Seventeen years ago, when the Outburst Queer Arts Festival first began, it certainly was not as celebrated or large as it is now. What we are trying to convey here is that we do not have to start big. We can aim for something small yet promising. While there might be expectations to check all the boxes, it is crucial to be mindful of our capacity as well. But, we can be capacitated and this is where you – people in power, art enthusiasts, grant and resource allocators and media come in. It is time we all believe in Nepali queer art and create space for it to not only survive but thrive. It is imperative to understand that formulating our imagination into reality can only be possible through unwavering collaboration.",['role entrepreneurship educ nepal ’ quest econom empower'],"['represent imag photo tanushre rao unsplashwhil nation prepar festiv light , tihar earli novemb 2023 , someth less excit fuell spark ocean away .', 'queer art festiv happen seventeenth year chanc attend deleg .', 'deleg made possibl collabor outburst art , art organis base northern ireland , uk british council , nepal.ther clear distinct citi term flourish art scene , becam appar visit belfast , northern ireland , specif outburst queer art festiv held charm citi centr .', 'organis festiv requir month care prepar planning.th queer art festiv start short event last day .', ', 17 year , grown ten-day festiv panel discuss , theatr perform , exhibit .', 'program guid avail venu , partner hotel , local librari , shop .', 'mani deleg , includ us , came outsid northern ireland attend.dur queer art festiv , opportun connect art curat , publish , artist , repres british council depart around world ( lithuania , franc , south africa , turkey , greec , jordan , england , argentina name . )', 'event attend gave us differ insight art facilit connect .', 'gain insight queer publish art curat challeng face countri due resourc sometim bureaucraci system .', 'also got see way peopl thrive given platform showcas work , art exhibit artist reimagin intimaci queer people.on hand , nepal struggl larg time queer visibl .', 'explicit space sogiesc ( sexual orient , gender ident express sex characterist ) artist showcas work openli come togeth commun , exist pocket space .', 'way , someth struck us presenc older queer artist festiv .', 'one particular event queer art festiv .', 'notic activ particip involv older queer peopl throughout festiv .', 'fascin see queer artist 40 50 share transform inspir work .', 'wherea , back home , queer folk forefront queer art , advocaci activ mostli gen-z millenni .', 'queer elder count finger dilig work nepali queer folk .', 'even among , still hold onto archaic notion refus evolv embrac chang .', ', ’ that.from dream realitydur queer art festiv , opportun connect art curat , publish artist .', 'photo raphael renter | @ raphi_rawr unsplashbefor select deleg , us join onlin meet british council nepal outburst repres facilit kaalo 101 ( art space patan ) , along interest queer artist nepal .', 'total three meet discuss possibl challeng queer art festiv nepal .', 'discours also entail us share present updat queer art scene nepal last five year .', 'updat includ memor leap taken queer art music literatur fashion artist divers walk life .', 'day third meet , british council extend invit us attend outburst queer art festival.our deleg one exampl transcontinent collabor someth happen first time involv us .', ', outburst art british council practis cross-continent collabor year .', 'even year ’ festiv , wit lot artist differ contin work togeth exhibit , lectur , panel discuss , magazin .', 'amalgam introduc us brilliant thought-provok work defi gender sociopolit norm .', 'power transcontinent collabor beyond beautiful.imagin queer art nepalphoto nikola gannon unsplashth queer art scene nepal emerg one .', 'full-fledg festiv may possibl , someth small yet signific achiev .', 'time , differ organis run larg art exhibitions/tour week month .', 'howev , microcosm nepal , especi kathmandu , capit stranger art-ori program .', 'unfamiliar precis queer art .', 'unfamiliar someth induc lack queer artist art .', 'sadli , inadequ platform , space resourc pursu queer arts.despit , year event literatur emerg centr queer ident , come without challeng .', 'collect stori , “ pride climb higher ” “ song revolut ” showcas stori nepali across nepal .', 'mani stori reflect nepali queer experi otherwis .', 'june pride parad queer youth group gain momentum well past year sinc concept , small gather larg parad perform commun member .', 'said blue diamond societi ’ ( bd ) rainbow visibl pride event august festiv saa-paru ( gai jatra ) run well decad ;

National Assembly election taking place today ,"The month of January saw major road accidents in different parts of the country, including Lamhi in Dang, Dhorpatan in Baglung, and Chandragiri in Kathmandu. Road accidents have been common throughout the country with Nepal Police data suggesting over 2,500 people dying in them annually. Despite this, the Ministry of Finance has shown reluctance to introduce the proposed Road Safety Bill to reduce traffic accidents, fatalities, and serious injuries, and enhance road safety. Instead, the Finance Ministry has asked the Ministry of Physical Infrastructure and Transport to include the proposed bill in the Public Roads Act. Along with that, the government’s initiative to pass dedicated laws on road safety and set up a mechanism, including the empowered National Road Safety Council (NRSC), to decrease accidents, has come to a halt.Keshav Kumar Sharma, secretary of the Ministry of Physical Infrastructure and Transport, says they asked for a dedicated road safety law that comprehensively addresses institutional arrangements was the need of the hour. This includes ensuring safety in road construction, promoting public awareness, providing training and communication facilities, implementing rescue mechanisms, and arranging rehabilitation for families affected by road accidents. However, the Ministry of Finance believes a separate law is unnecessary due to concerns about potential increased financial burden.Hourly needOfficials from the Ministry of Physical Infrastructure allege that the Ministry of Finance is approaching sensitive matters, such as passenger safety, solely from an economic standpoint. They say that concerns related to road, vehicle, and passenger safety are being overshadowed, and there are indications that this approach will continue. “The government is avoiding addressing the sensitive issue of road accidents and the associated human and material costs, fearing an increase in expenses. This contradicts the government’s commitment and policy to reduce traffic accidents in the future,” says an official from the Ministry of Physical Infrastructure on the condition of anonymity.According to the Ministry of Physical Infrastructure, the existing laws lack the vision and purpose necessary for developing a sustainable, safe, risk-free, and reliable transportation operation and security system. Therefore, the Ministry of Physical Infrastructure officials argue that a distinct law is essential to decrease road accidents and ensure the safety of pedestrians, including passenger transport workers and roadside residents, as well as pets, wild animals, and birds. “The Road Safety Act is the need of the hour as it will help us during post-accident rescue, treatment management, rehabilitation, and legal representation,” says the official.Currently, there are gaps in enforcing road rules, monitoring vehicle capacities, ensuring road structure safety, managing traffic signs, and organizing road safety facilities. The implementation of the Road Safety Act is seen as crucial to address these issues.However, there has not been a facilitative environment for providing education and raising awareness about road traffic safety, safety mechanisms, and coordinating among organisations related to road transport. The aspect of training drivers with skills and knowledge, as well as monitoring road safety on the roads, is also lacking. This is why experts have been suggesting introducing a separate road safety law to address these aspects.The Finance Ministry, however, says that road safety should not be downplayed by ignoring human sensibilities related to road safety and citing economic reasons. Officials from the Ministry of Physical Infrastructure argue that incorporating safety considerations in the Road Act does not automatically result in a decrease in accidents or the integration of post-accident rescue, relief, and rehabilitation efforts.“The existing laws do not address road safety anywhere. Due to its lack of clarity and inadequacy, it has not been implemented with due diligence. For instance, provisions such as those for vehicle inspectors outlined in the Transport Act have not been acted upon by the government,” says an official from the Transport Ministry.Policies and commitments, but no lawsThe Motor Vehicles and Transport Management Act (1993) includes several provisions related to vehicle registration, road permits, driver’s licenses, traffic management, insurance, and penalties. The Public Roads Act (1974) primarily focuses on road management. However, there is no provision in the Act regarding the National Road Safety Council.In this situation, Nepal has developed a 10-year road safety action plan but is yet to enact corresponding legislation. Unfortunately, government agencies and mechanisms are not obligated to follow the action plan, as it lacks legal guidance.Now, the Transport Ministry holds the view that if safety considerations are explicitly addressed in the Public Roads Act, the outcome will not differ from what the Finance Ministry has said. Given the Public Roads Act’s close association with the Department of Road, the ministry thinks greater emphasis will be placed on road construction. However, they argue that incorporating the road safety aspect into the Act would not be effective.Secretary Sharma of the Transport Ministry is tasked with ensuring road safety, overseeing physical infrastructure and transport, and coordinating efforts across education, health, home, law, federal affairs, and general administration ministries. This responsibility extends to provincial ministries, local levels, as well as various agencies, organisations, security agencies, non-governmental organisations, and related entities, each with their specific roles.“As all the agencies need to be allocated responsibilities for various aspects of road safety, we have requested them to collaborate in formulating a distinct law. This should encompass the reduction of all types of accidents,” said Sharma.The ministry believes that a dedicated law addressing road safety is crucial to mitigate severe road accidents in Nepal and to uphold the commitments made by the country on the international stage.Nepal has committed to implementing the Stockholm Declaration through the Global Road Traffic Safety Conference in 2020, as per the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. Nepal, which has incorporated sustainable development goals into its national development plan, has not yet commenced work aligned with these objectives.Nevertheless, Nepal’s neighbouring countries are already addressing road safety through legal frameworks. Various states in India have enacted road safety laws, and the effectiveness of these laws is contributing to a 50 per cent reduction in road accidents.In 1999, Bhutan also introduced a unified road safety and transport act. Pakistan, on the other hand, issued the National Highway Safety Ordinance-2000 to ensure road safety, distinct from its National Highway Authority Act (1991). Britain, Australia, America, New Zealand, and other countries have established separate road safety laws as well.Road safety neglectedIn Nepal, road safety has been consistently neglected due to the absence of dedicated legislation. Road safety expert Keshav Adhikari says that the government primarily focused on road construction, overlooks crucial aspects such as road safety and reinforcement. Consequently, roads are transforming into perilous pathways for both vehicles and passengers.“There is a lack of interest in formulating policies and laws aimed at mitigating financial losses resulting from accidents,” says Adhikari.He further points out that safety is not a governmental priority, as expanding the road network is perceived to yield more political benefits than implementing additional structures to enhance road safety.“When I worked as an expert in the Transport Ministry for over a year, I realised that promoting road safety is not a government priority,” he says. “Annually, more people die due to road accidents than those who die in natural disasters, but the government has not given it much attention.”Even though the prime minister, ministers, and MPs keep asserting that roads have been constructed, no one seems to be addressing the critical issues of road safety and quality.Saroj Sitaula, General Secretary of the Federation of Nepalese National Transport Entrepreneurs (FNNTE), says that the government must be attentive as accidents are on the rise due to various technical and human factors, including road infrastructure. “Many accidents can be mitigated by improving road conditions, installing barriers on the sides, putting up informational boards, and ensuring scientific and practical road markings,” he says. “We need to formulate a plan and progress accordingly.”Sitaula argues that the government should establish policies to create mechanisms for emergency rescue, treatment, and rehabilitation after an accident occurs. He emphasises the importance of enhancing road infrastructure, conducting a scientific examination of the technical condition of vehicles, and ensuring compliance with the law by drivers, passengers, and regulators. He says that blaming drivers and transport entrepreneurs for accidents is inadequate, and the government must fulfil its responsibilities.Roads are unsafeNepal currently boasts a road network spanning approximately 100,000 km, with the majority consisting of dirt and gravel roads. Among the more than 22,000 kilometres of national and subsidiary highways, numerous sections remain unpaved.Despite the government’s substantial investment in road construction and expansion, minimal efforts are allocated to ensuring road safety. Recently, all three levels of government have accelerated the widening of roads, incorporating asphalt and slopes. However, it appears that issues concerning road quality and safety are escalating at a faster pace. Roads that have been neglected in the guise of maintenance have become a nightmare for the public.Infrastructure expert Suryaraj Acharya notes that these problems arise due to the tendency to construct roads only after they have sustained damage, without considering potential issues during the initial construction phase.",['nation assembl elect take place today'],"['month januari saw major

Erroneous border pillar placement plagues Nepali farmers in Madhesh ,"Realme 12 Pro+ 5G. Photo: Realme IndiaRealme has launched its popular mid-range number series smartphone, the Realme 12 Pro series. The series includes the Realme 12 Pro 5G and the Realme 12 Pro+ 5G which are the successors of the Realme 11 Pro+ 5G and Realme 11 Pro 5G respectively. The Realme 11 series was widely appreciated for its design and performance at the price range. The 12 series has stepped up the game with an even better design. Realme has not only changed the design but has also upgraded the performance and the camera to compete in the mid-range price market. Realme recently has been focusing a lot on the design aspect and the price range performance. The 12 Pro+ has some major differences from last year’s 11 Pro+ which include design, IP rating, chipset, camera and charging. Let us see what the luxuriously designed smartphone delivers in terms of specs.Specifications of Realme 12 Pro+ 5GDimensionsLength: 161.47mmWidth: 74.02mmDepth: 8.75mmWeight196 gramsDisplay typeAMOLEDDisplay size6.7-inchResolution2,412 x 1,080 (FHD+)Refresh rateUp to 120HzIP ratingIP65 dust and water resistance Glass Protection0.55mm Double-Reinforced GlassChipsetSnapdragon 7s Gen 2 (4nm)CPUOcta-core (4×2.40 GHz Cortex-A78 & 4×1.95 GHz Cortex-A55)GPUAdreno 710OSRealme UI 5.0 based on Android 14RAM8GB | 12GBStorage128GB | 256GBRear camera 50MP Sony IMX890 main camera8MP ultra-wide camera64MP periscope portrait cameraSelfie camera32MP Wi-Fi802.11 a/b/g/n/ac/ax（Wi-Fi 6）Bluetooth5.2NetworkLTE | 5GSIMDual Nano SIMAudioDual SpeakersSupports Dolby AtmosDual-mic Noise CancellationHi-Res Audio CertificationSensorsGeomagnetic sensor, Proximity sensor, Light sensor, Acceleration sensor, Gyroscope, In-display fingerprint sensorBattery5,000mAh (typ)Charging67W SUPERVOOC wired fast chargingPorts and Buttons2 Nano SIM Card SlotsType-C PortPower ButtonVolume ButtonsColoursSubmarine BlueNavigator BeigeExplorer RedPrice (expected)Rs 50,000 (8/128GB)Rs 54,000 (8/256GB)Rs 60,000 (12/256GB)Design and DisplayThe Realme 12 Pro+ and the Realme 12 Pro share the same design and dimensions. The design is fascinating. Realme patterned up with Luxury Swiss Watch designer Ollivier Savéo to craftfully design the smartphone. All the colour options have a vegan leather back. Since the phone is designed by a luxury watch designer, it comes with a big round camera module housing the triple camera setup. There is a golden 3D Jubilee Bracelet which gives the texture of a luxury watch strap. A golden patterned line runs through the middle and around the camera module for an even better look.Realme 12 Pro+ 5G designer Ollivier Savéo.

On the front, the 12 Pro+ 5G has a curved screen with a centred hole-punch cutout which houses the selfie camera. The bezels are minimal with the sides being curved almost zero while the top and the chin have a slight ear-like bezel.

Photo: Realme IndiaPerformance and StorageThe performance has also been stepped up with the change from MediaTek Chipset in the 11 Pro series to Snapdragon chipsets in the 12 Pro series. The Realme 12 Pro+ 5G is powered by the Snapdragon 7s Gen 2 chipset built on a 4nm processor. It has an octa-core CPU, which includes Cortex-A78 and Cortex-A55 cores for seamless multitasking and responsiveness. The Adreno 710 GPU handles the graphics for gaming and multimedia. Photo: Realme IndiaIt runs on the Realme UI 5.0 based on Android 14. The overall software experience is good but Realme gets back to the cost-cutting techniques in the software part with a bunch load of pre-installed hot apps and hot games. It also has a 3D VC liquid cooling system which spans 3394mm² and covers the main heat sources of the motherboard giving a boost in heat dissipation efficiency.Photo: Realme IndiaThe Realme 12 Pro+ 5G is available in two RAM options which include 8GB and 12GB. The 8GB RAM is paired with 128GB and 256GB storage options while the 12GB RAM is paired with 256GB of storage. It also has a Dynamic RAM feature which helps to increase the RAM size up to 24GB using the internal storage.Photo: Realme IndiaCameraThe camera on the Realme 12 Pro+ 5G is also interesting. Here, Realme has partnered up with Chilean cinematographer Claudio Miranda. He has worked in films such as Life of Pi, Top Gun: Maverick, The Curious Case of Benjamin Button and Tron: Legacy. He has also won an Academy Award for Best Cinematography for his role in Life of Pi in 2013. Claudio Miranda has worked with Realme for fine-tuning images. There are also three film filters made in collaboration with Claudio Miranda with unique colour grading matched with a 2.39:1 aspect ratio and cinematic-level bokeh adjustment. The filters are Journey, Maverick and Memory. Photo: Realme IndiaThe Realme 12 Pro+ 5G has a triple camera setup at the rear. The main camera features a 50MP Sony IMX890 sensor with OIS for steady and stable shots. It has a resolution of 4,096 x 3,072 and an aperture of f/1.8, while the 24mm equivalent focal length provides a wide field of view (FOV) of 84°.Photo: Realme IndiaInstead of using a macro camera or a depth sensor, Realme has stepped the game with a 64MP periscope portrait camera with an OmniVision OV64B sensor. It delivers a resolution of 4,624 x 3,472 and supports OIS for steady telephoto shots. With an aperture of f/2.8 and a focal length equivalent to 71mm, it delivers impressive portrait shots with a narrow FOV of 33° and 3x optical zoom. The last camera is an 8MP ultra-wide camera, providing a wide range of view with a focal length equivalent to 16mm and an aperture of f/2.2 and FOV of 112°.Photo: Realme IndiaThe rear camera has a lot of photography features including Auto-zoom, street photography mode, moon mode, starry mode pro, super nightscape, pano, professional mode, portrait mode, HDR, AI scene recognition, AI beauty, filters, text scanner, portrait distortion correction, one take and a super group portrait.Photo: Realme IndiaAs for video shooting, the rear camera of the Realme 12 Pro+ 5G can shoot 4K videos at 30fps, 1080p and 720p videos at both 30fps and 60fps.

"Regenerative Braking in EVs: Advantages, Disadvantages and Common Misconceptions ","Ram Bujhaun Yadav with his land ownership certificate stands near a border pillar which he says was erroneously placed on his land. In October 2023, when 51-year-old Ram Bujhaun Yadav of Musaharnia Rural Municipality-5, Mukhiyapatti, Dhanusha, was at a relative’s house, someone told him that two Indian Sashastra Seema Bal (SSB) personnel were looking for him.Anxious, he rushed home wondering why they were looking for him.“They asked me if the paddy field in the no man’s land was mine. I told them yes and they asked me to cut down the paddy immediately,” he said.The paddy was not ripe and Yadav asked them for some time. However, the SSB personnel told him he had to cut down his paddy immediately.Ram Bujhaun and his wife Tetari Devi each own a 677-square-metre plot of land. As Nepal and India reevaluated the border, Ram Bujhan’s land was been deemed to be near the no man’s land as it now has two demarcation pillars.Frustrated, Ram Bujhaun cut the paddy before it was due to be harvested. Now, he has been asked to not plant anything on the land as it falls in the no man’s land.“Our border police don’t say a word. I can’t fight the SSB on my own,” says Ram Bujhaun adding he had decided not to plan anything on the land anymore.Woes of the farmersMany farmers in southern Nepal say their land has now been placed in India after the recent demarcation. When the Jamuna River, which flows through the no man’s land between Nepal and India, changed its course some two decades ago, some border pillars went missing. Locals say these pillars have now been placed encroaching on Nepali land.In 2018, with the then Chief District Officer of Dhanusha, Pradeep Raj Kandel, and an official from Madhubani district, Bihar, India, a team that included border security forces from both countries, the Armed Police Force of Nepal, and SSB of India began placing border pillars after land measurement by technicians.Locals have raised concerns, stating that border pillars have been positioned, encroaching approximately 50 to 100 meters of land into Nepal compared to the previous position. Many like Ram Bujhaun are unaware of when these border pillars were placed.“I did not know that pillar was placed here. After I found out when I asked the village leaders, many said they were placing the border pillars as they pleased,” said Ram Bujhaun.He was told to carry on planting paddy and that it would not matter as these issues had happened in the past. “They encroached on my land and have asked me not to plant anything. This is gross injustice,” he says.Ram Bujhaun’s family owns a total of 4,000 square metres of land, with 2,000 square metres belonging to him and the remaining 2,000 square metres to his brother Bechan. However, 1,000 square metres of his land is now located on the Indian side after the demarcation. Despite this, he has been farming on the land and continues to pay taxes to the Department of Land Management and Archive in Nepal.“They have marked my land to be on the Indian side and placed border pillars on it. I’ve been farming till now but I don’t know when they will ask me to stop,” he says.Ignorance of the governmentThe Madhesh province in southern NepalThe former ward chair of Mukhiyapatti Musharniya Rural Municipality-5, Ram Naresh Yadav, said that over time, India has encroached on numerous Nepali lands in various locations in the Madhesh Province. This, he says, happened due to the Nepali administration’s ignorance and weak stature.“They (Nepali administration) were careless and that meant the Indian side placed these border pillars by encroaching on Nepali land,” says Ram Naresh.He said that over 40 farmers from wards 1, 5, and 6 have land ranging from 300 to 1,600 square metres on the Indian side. “These farmers have land ownership certificates, but they cannot farm as the SSB says the land is in India and not Nepal,” said Ram Naresh.In 1996, land ownership certificates were distributed after surveying the land in the border area. Local Dharmendra Kumar Yadav said that since then, the locals have been paying their land tax regularly. In 2018, when the pillar was being placed, the locals protested when they saw their land was being encroached on. However, since the demarcation had been agreed upon by high-ranking government officials of Nepal and India, the farmer’s voices went unheard.“We tried to stop when the border pillars were being placed on our land. But the administrators from both sides forcibly put it there without even trying to hold a discussion,” said Harish Chandra Yadav. The Chief District Officer of Dhanusha, Chakrapani Pandey, says that the border pillars were placed by the technical team after the measurements and with the agreement of the high-ranking officials of the two countries.“The fields and houses that are built in no man’s land have recently been cleared. No one can do anything in this particular area,” said Pandey. “We understand the people’s concern but we cannot do anything about it now.”","['regen brake ev : advantag , disadvantag common misconcept']","['ram bujhaun yadav land ownership certif stand near border pillar say erron place land .', 'octob 2023 , 51-year-old ram bujhaun yadav musaharnia rural municipality-5 , mukhiyapatti , dhanusha , rel ’ hous , someon told two indian sashastra seema bal ( ssb ) personnel look him.anxi , rush home wonder look him . “ ask paddi field man ’ land mine .', 'told ye ask cut paddi immedi , ” said.th paddi ripe yadav ask time .', 'howev , ssb personnel told cut paddi immediately.ram bujhaun wife tetari devi 677-square-metr plot land .', 'nepal india reevalu border , ram bujhan ’ land deem near man ’ land two demarc pillars.frustr , ram bujhaun cut paddi due harvest .', ', ask plant anyth land fall man ’ land . “ border polic ’ say word .', '’ fight ssb , ” say ram bujhaun ad decid plan anyth land anymore.wo farmersmani farmer southern nepal say land place india recent demarc .', 'jamuna river , flow man ’ land nepal india , chang cours two decad ago , border pillar went miss .', 'local say pillar place encroach nepali land.in 2018 , chief district offic dhanusha , pradeep raj kandel , offici madhubani district , bihar , india , team includ border secur forc countri , arm polic forc nepal , ssb india began place border pillar land measur technicians.loc rais concern , state border pillar posit , encroach approxim 50 100 meter land nepal compar previou posit .', 'mani like ram bujhaun unawar border pillar place . “ know pillar place .', 'found ask villag leader , mani said place border pillar pleas , ” said ram bujhaun.h told carri plant paddi would matter issu happen past .', '“ encroach land ask plant anyth .', 'gross injustic , ” says.ram bujhaun ’ famili own total 4,000 squar metr land , 2,000 squar metr belong remain 2,000 squar metr brother bechan .', 'howev , 1,000 squar metr land locat indian side demarc .', 'despit , farm land continu pay tax depart land manag archiv nepal . “ mark land indian side place border pillar .', '’ farm till ’ know ask stop , ” says.ignor governmentth madhesh provinc southern nepalth former ward chair mukhiyapatti musharniya rural municipality-5 , ram naresh yadav , said time , india encroach numer nepali land variou locat madhesh provinc .', ', say , happen due nepali administr ’ ignor weak statur . “ ( nepali administr ) careless meant indian side place border pillar encroach nepali land , ” say ram naresh.h said 40 farmer ward 1 , 5 , 6 land rang 300 1,600 squar metr indian side .', '“ farmer land ownership certif , farm ssb say land india nepal , ” said ram naresh.in 1996 , land ownership certif distribut survey land border area .', 'local dharmendra kumar yadav said sinc , local pay land tax regularli .', '2018 , pillar place , local protest saw land encroach .', 'howev , sinc demarc agre upon high-rank govern offici nepal india , farmer ’ voic went unheard . “ tri stop border pillar place land .', 'administr side forcibl put without even tri hold discuss , ” said harish chandra yadav .', 'chief district offic dhanusha , chakrapani pandey , say border pillar place technic team measur agreement high-rank offici two countri . “ field hous built man ’ land recent clear .', 'one anyth particular area , ” said pandey .', '“ understand peopl ’ concern anyth . ”']"
Nepal’s ‘low-altitude’ snow leopard would face big hurdles in return to wild ,"Photo by pippen on UnsplashLife is filled with surprises and unexpected events and it can change at any moment. The only thing certain in life is the uncertainty. Change is a natural and inevitable part of our lives, and it may be positive as well as negative.Even though it is not guaranteed that we will wake up in the morning, we set the alarm every night with the hope that we will wake up in the morning. We do not know what each day is going to bring us, but we may have varieties, adventures, and endless opportunities.The push to exploreThe uncertainty sometimes forces us to explore those aspects of life, we never knew existed or needed. It also tests the mental strength of people and how they deal with it. The uncertainty has taught me to be grateful, as we never know what life throws at us.In life, everything does not go according to our plans, and if we do not embrace the change we will face huge trouble. The Covid-19 pandemic is the best example of uncertainty, we were constantly fearing death and it was uncertain that we would see the sunrise the next day.It is not certain that every decision in life will be correct, but if you fear not trying at all, you miss endless opportunities for learning and growing. When our decisions or outcomes are on the negative side, we get depressed and we might tend to think about committing suicide, but we forget that if we have life we have endless opportunities. Most of us plan for our careers, our love life, etc. and when those plans do not work out we start getting uncomfortable. But if we can deal with today, we can surely deal with tomorrow. We need to cherish little moments in our lives and know that nothing is permanent not even the failures and setbacks.We come here with nothing and leave with nothing. So why should we hold the egos and grudges against each other? Instead of making our life meaningful and enjoying the journey of life, we get into puzzles of accumulating wealth and we go against our own loved ones for it. Change is certainPhoto by Kathyryn Tripp on UnsplashNothing is permanent in life, everything can change in fractions of seconds. In today’s society, everyone is so busy, that we people have so less time for our loved ones. What I have learned over the years, is to find time in our busy schedule for our family because we never know when it will be our last day together with them. Yes! Death is a natural process, so if you have to die someday, why should you die with grudges in your heart? But instead of worrying about the inevitable, focusing on the things you can control will bring a lot of happiness in life.Uncertainty is not only a negative thing; it also brings a lot of opportunity because you dare to change. The life-changing experience will not come knocking down your door, you need to expose yourself. We learn by doing and experimenting, even though we might fail. But that is not the end of the world. I still remember hesitating while applying for the role of leadership, at my school level as it was not certain that I would be chosen.Even after being selected, I was uncertain about whether I could fulfil my responsibilities or not. But that uncertainty helped me grow out of my comfort zone and give my best input. If I had not applied for that role just because I was uncertain of the outcome, I would miss the biggest learning opportunity in my school life. So, do not let the uncertainty or the unknown ever stop you from trying and no matter how much we try, to plan life always finds a way to surprise us. It is important to stay grounded when we have everything we wish for because life can take such a turn that we had never expected in our wildest dreams. Similarly, nothing is permanent in life, the financial hardships, the grades, the breakups, etc. But the most important thing is not to lose hope during those difficult times.According to the data provided by Nepal police, around 6,830 people took their lives in the fiscal year 2022/23. There is nothing in life that cannot be resolved although it may take time, committing suicide should not be an option. It’s important to share feelings among family members or loved ones because together as a family any problem can be overcome.Embrace the unknown and focus on enhancing your life, instead of worrying about what will happen next.

Queer art festival: Reflecting and imagining the power of collaboration in Nepal ,"Growing up in Bajhang, Rabindra Dhant had big dreams. He longed for recognition, a burning desire to etch his name in the history books. Fate, however, had a different path for him.In school, Dhant’s passion lay in volleyball, and he aspired to be the pride of his village on the court. His goal was to rise high and deliver powerful shots that would echo his name far and wide in the village. But that never happened because of his height.At the age of 16, he realised that he needed to leave Bajhang in pursuit of a brighter future, just as his father and brother had done before him. It was there that he ventured into the world of karate, eventually transitioning into mixed martial arts (MMA). This decision, as fate would have it, would transform his life entirely.On September 15, Rabindra Dhant made history as Nepal’s first fighter in the esteemed One Championship. Going head-to-head against the seasoned Russian fighter, Torepchi Dongak, the 24-year-old secured his place in Nepal’s history book by effortlessly besting his opponent in the third round. Just days after, he was welcomed by hundreds of enthusiastic supporters as he touched down in Kathmandu from Thailand, a touching manifestation of a once cherished dream.“I could not believe that was all for me,” Dhant tells Onlinekhabar. “In my childhood, I had yearned for recognition from my village. And now, here I stood at the airport, the entire country embracing me like a hero.”That has filled a fire in his belly. After five gruelling years of blood, sweat and tears, Rabindra Dhant has finally earned his place in an international fight. Yet, he perceives this achievement as merely the beginning. He is firm in his resolve not to let the love and fame he has garnered overshadow his dedication. He recognises the need to persevere, to work even harder, in order to compete on the grandest stage the world has to offer.“I owe that to myself and to the people who have stood by me when I was alone,” he says.Fighting for passionListen to what Rabindra Dhant has to say about his One Championship fight and his MMA journey.Rabindra Dhant grew up in Bitthadchir rural municipality in Bajhang. After completing his grade 10, he left for Pithoragarh in Uttarakhand, India. That was, and still, is what a lot of young boys who grow up in Sudarpaschim Province in Nepal do. During his mid-teens, he took up physical labour. Alongside his friends from the village, he toiled, moving rocks and even an electricity pole, all in pursuit of earning enough for two meals a day. His father, having endured the hardships of such labour, longed for a brighter future for him. He encouraged Dhant to venture to New Delhi in search of better employment opportunities.“He told me to find a technical job,” says Dhant.In Delhi, he secured a job as an office boy, spending his days tidying up the workspace and preparing tea for those who worked there. Witnessing young boys and girls of his age coming in to study, striving to build a future for themselves, served as a stark realisation that being confined to the role of an office boy was not the life he aspired for.Karate became his refuge. He dedicated his mornings to rigorous training, while his afternoons were devoted to office chores. His progress caught the eye of his coaches, who recommended that he explore the realm of MMA.“I had no idea what MMA was. But I was told that I had great stamina and that would help me so I decided to try my hand at it,” he says.Rabindra Dhant trains aspiring MMA fighters at The Pump in Jhamsikhel. Photo: Aryan DhimalHis venture remained a well-guarded secret within his family. Knowing he would not receive their approval, he decided not to tell anyone.However, matters grew more complex when he found himself in need of funds to participate in an amateur fight night. He mustered the courage to tell his uncles about his involvement in MMA classes. He explained his desire to compete in a fight. His uncles were not happy, but they agreed to give him money asking him to give up his MMA pursuit thereafter.Having emerged victorious in the competition, he held onto the hope that it would finally silence his critics. But to his dismay, he continued to face relentless pressure to abandon his pursuit.“No one in my village was into sports. I was the first sportsperson from the village,” he says. “This is why I did not get the support. Every time my parents called, they would ask how much money I would make. That was discouraging.”By this point, he was captivated by the sport. After making a strong impression on his coaches, he was offered the opportunity to become a trainer at the local gym. He shared this news with his parents, but once again, he was met with the discouraging response that he would not be earning any money by becoming a fighter.Money held little sway over Rabindra Dhant at the time. He was passionate about MMA and was doing whatever in his power to ensure he made it. This dedication pushed him to win a national-level amateur competition in India. Winning that made him eligible to take part in the world championship.In order to get here, he would have to relinquish his Nepali citizenship and adopt an Indian one. However, the prospect of hoisting the Indian flag was a step he was not yet ready to take. Instead, he chose to return to Nepal, determined to explore any possible avenues for participation.“Nepal did not have an association which meant my world championship dream was shattered.”Disappointed, he returned to Delhi and took part in various professional fights. While these bouts seldom brought in money, they instilled in him a fighting spirit that would eliminate fear from his system in the long run.Finding mentorRabindra Dhant training at The Pump. Photo: Aryan DhimalThe Covid pandemic compelled him, like many other Nepalis working in India, to return home. After the lockdown lifted, he returned to India, only to find it increasingly challenging to secure fights. Frustration mounting, he eventually made the decision to come back to Nepal, seriously considering leaving Nepal for foreign employment.“I wanted to go to countries where I could fight. But I could not find a place where I could do that. All employment agencies told me the same thing I could not continue MMA if I left for foreign employment.”That is when he met jiu-jitsu coach Diwiz Piya Lama. Around 2021, jiu-jitsu was one of the few forms of MMA that was being taught in Nepal. After engaging in sparring sessions with each other, Lama recognised Dhant’s potential and decided to mentor him.“That was my turning point. Diwiz dai has been an important figure in my life. Without him, I would probably be working abroad,” he says.A strong sense of brotherhood and mutual respect defines the relationship between them. Their connection is tangible; Lama beams with pride at Dhant’s achievements, while Dhant looks up to Lama with sincere fondness and profound respect. In the span of the last two years, their camaraderie has solidified, woven through unwavering day and night training sessions, all in pursuit of their collective dream to take Nepali MMA to new heights.Fighting out of Nepal, Rabindra Dhant ventured to Bangalore, Madhya Pradesh, and Goa for fights. With each victory, his confidence grew, reinforcing his belief that he was on the path to success. However, the persistent pressure from his family back home always loomed in the back of his mind, casting a shadow over his aspirations.“The talk about me not earning money and supporting my family was always something that kept me awake at night. Despite all that, I was winning. Sometimes I wonder what would have happened if I was not winning.”Bajhang to BangkokYouTube sensation Sisan Baniya is making a documentary on Rabindra Dhant.Lama believing in him, however, gave him added confidence. Lama, in various podcasts, has been stating how strong Rabindra Dhant is and how fearless he is. Eager to showcase Dhant’s talent in Nepal, Lama embarked on a project: the Nepal Warrior Championship.Lama wanted Nepali fighters to get more exposure which would then catch the eye of sports promotions abroad. Rabindra Dhant was the main event of the show as he took on India’s Jason Lyngdoh. Dhant won comfortably and that gave Lama the belief he was ready for the big stage and asked him to come to Thailand with him.“I had no money but he insisted I go and there I was training at Fairtex with some great fighters.”As Dhant was training, Lama was working behind the scenes to fix a fight for him. They had been to the Lumpinee Stadium in Bangkok and were manifesting fighting there. Soon their hard work paid off. Dhant got the fight he wanted. He was all set to take on the Russian fighter with around 300 amateur fights to his name, Torepchi Dongak.Over the next month, he dedicated himself to training with an intensity he had never before experienced. Under the guidance of different coaches, he reflects that he gained more in that short span than he had in the five years prior.It was a gruelling journey. He had to shed eight kilograms and forgo the foods he enjoyed. Enduring four to five hours of rigorous training each day in the sweltering, humid air of Thailand, the challenges were undeniable. Yet, he carried the awareness that many had toiled tirelessly to pave the way for him. He, too, had put in relentless effort to reach this point.Fight nightRabindra Dhant secured a comfortable victory against Torepchi Dongak in the One Championship. Photo Courtesy: Diwiz Piya LamaStepping into the ring, Rabindra Dhant exuded a determined focus. The pressure was undeniable, yet he held onto the belief that triumph would unlock a world of possibilities for him.“I keep telling myself if I won, everything I wish for would come true. If I did not win, all my dreams were over,” he says.As Round 1 commenced, he was prepared for what lay ahead, and the unfolding events followed the anticipated course. While he believed he could hold his own against Dongak in striking, he soon recognised the necessity to alter his approach. He realised he could not keep up with the rapid pace of the kickboxer.Adapting his strategy, Dhant opted for takedowns, gradually wearing Dongak down. The Russian fighter appeared fatigued, succumbing to the mounting pressure as Dhant secured rounds 1 and 2.“Coaches told me to finish him.”And finish him he did. In the third round, he executed a decisive takedown, relentlessly striking Dongak until the referee intervened, halting the match. At that moment, Rabindra Dhant stood victorious, leaving him momentarily lost for words in the wake of his monumental victory.“I looked at the camera and said, Nepal had arrived in the international fighting scene.”The day became etched in the memory of every MMA enthusiast in Nepal. The match was screened live in numerous locations across the country. Dhant’s name was being tagged in various social media posts, and as he connected to WiFi, his phone froze under the flood of congratulations pouring in from every corner of the land.“It was so emotional. I had to take a moment to take it all in.”Upon his return home on September 19, Rabindra Dhant was greeted with a grand welcome at the Tribhuvan International Airport.“I always used to wonder what it would feel like to receive a hero’s welcome in my village. Yet, here I stood at the airport, surrounded by people, snapping pictures with me. I could not help but wonder what I had done to deserve all of this.”He believes that his professional MMA career is just taking off. It is a stark change, considering the same parents who used to question him about when he would start earning money are now standing firmly behind him, offering their support.“One Championship was my dream, but I never anticipated receiving so much love in my debut,” says Dhant. “My professional MMA journey has just begun, and I am fully aware that I will need to put in twice the effort to reach the next level.”",['queer art festiv : reflect imagin power collabor nepal'],"['grow bajhang , rabindra dhant big dream .', 'long recognit , burn desir etch name histori book .', 'fate , howev , differ path him.in school , dhant ’ passion lay volleybal , aspir pride villag court .', 'goal rise high deliv power shot would echo name far wide villag .', 'never happen height.at age 16 , realis need leav bajhang pursuit brighter futur , father brother done .', 'ventur world karat , eventu transit mix martial art ( mma ) .', 'decis , fate would , would transform life entirely.on septemb 15 , rabindra dhant made histori nepal ’ first fighter esteem one championship .', 'go head-to-head season russian fighter , torepchi dongak , 24-year-old secur place nepal ’ histori book effortlessli best oppon third round .', 'day , welcom hundr enthusiast support touch kathmandu thailand , touch manifest cherish dream . “ could believ , ” dhant tell onlinekhabar .', '“ childhood , yearn recognit villag .', ', stood airport , entir countri embrac like hero . ” fill fire belli .', 'five gruell year blood , sweat tear , rabindra dhant final earn place intern fight .', 'yet , perceiv achiev mere begin .', 'firm resolv let love fame garner overshadow dedic .', 'recognis need persever , work even harder , order compet grandest stage world offer . “ owe peopl stood alon , ” says.fight passionlisten rabindra dhant say one championship fight mma journey.rabindra dhant grew bitthadchir rural municip bajhang .', 'complet grade 10 , left pithoragarh uttarakhand , india .', ', still , lot young boy grow sudarpaschim provinc nepal .', 'mid-teen , took physic labour .', 'alongsid friend villag , toil , move rock even electr pole , pursuit earn enough two meal day .', 'father , endur hardship labour , long brighter futur .', 'encourag dhant ventur new delhi search better employ opportun . “ told find technic job , ” say dhant.in delhi , secur job offic boy , spend day tidi workspac prepar tea work .', 'wit young boy girl age come studi , strive build futur , serv stark realis confin role offic boy life aspir for.kar becam refug .', 'dedic morn rigor train , afternoon devot offic chore .', 'progress caught eye coach , recommend explor realm mma . “ idea mma .', 'told great stamina would help decid tri hand , ” says.rabindra dhant train aspir mma fighter pump jhamsikhel .', 'photo : aryan dhimalhi ventur remain well-guard secret within famili .', 'know would receiv approv , decid tell anyone.howev , matter grew complex found need fund particip amateur fight night .', 'muster courag tell uncl involv mma class .', 'explain desir compet fight .', 'uncl happi , agre give money ask give mma pursuit thereafter.hav emerg victori competit , held onto hope would final silenc critic .', 'dismay , continu face relentless pressur abandon pursuit . “ one villag sport .', 'first sportsperson villag , ” say .', '“ get support .', 'everi time parent call , would ask much money would make .', 'discourag . ” point , captiv sport .', 'make strong impress coach , offer opportun becom trainer local gym .', 'share news parent , , met discourag respons would earn money becom fighter.money held littl sway rabindra dhant time .', 'passion mma whatev power ensur made .', 'dedic push win national-level amateur competit india .', 'win made elig take part world championship.in order get , would relinquish nepali citizenship adopt indian one .', 'howev , prospect hoist indian flag step yet readi take .', 'instead , chose return nepal , determin explor possibl avenu particip . “ nepal associ meant world championship dream shatter . ” disappoint , return delhi took part variou profession fight .', 'bout seldom brought money , instil fight spirit would elimin fear system long run.find mentorrabindra dhant train pump .', 'photo : aryan dhimalth covid pandem compel , like mani nepali work india , return home .', 'lockdown lift , return india , find increasingli challeng secur fight .', 'frustrat mount , eventu made decis come back nepal , serious consid leav nepal foreign employ . “ want go countri could fight .', 'could find place could .', 'employ agenc told thing could continu mma left foreign employ . ” met jiu-jitsu coach diwiz piya lama .', 'around 2021 , jiu-jitsu one form mma taught nepal .', 'engag spar session , lama recognis dhant ’ potenti decid mentor him . “ turn point .', 'diwiz dai import figur life .', 'without , would probabl work abroad , ” says.a strong sens brotherhood mutual respect defin relationship .', 'connect tangibl ;

U19 SAFF Championship: Nepal reach semi-final in style,"File: Gautam Buddha International Cricket Stadium Chitwan, September 15The construction of Gautam Buddha International Cricket Stadium which was halted due to various reasons will resume soon.The construction of the stadium came to a halt when the Dhurmus-Suntali Foundation, led by actors Sitaram Kattel and Kunjana Ghimire, withdrew their involvement, citing a lack of funds for the project.The project will now be taken forward by Bharatpur metropolitan city as Mayor Renu Dahal has pledged to complete the project.“It will be completed during my term as the mayor of Bhatartpur,” she said at an event held.Dahal explained that a substantial loan is required to complete the stadium’s construction, and since there was no agreement in place for the government to cover the loan, she pointed out that progressing with the construction has become challenging.Dahal said the construction would be carried out in phases.In April, the government discussed taking over the responsibility to build the Bharatpur cricket stadium which has been left in limbo by the Dhurmus Suntali Foundation for the lack of funds.Construction of the proposed Gautam Buddha International Cricket Stadium began on January 30, 2019. Nepalis at home and abroad as well as some expats chipped in their money, supporting the foundation financially. Everyone was hopeful that this would be Nepal’s most well-facilitated cricket stadium in a couple of years.",['u19 saff championship : nepal reach semi-fin style'],"['file : gautam buddha intern cricket stadium chitwan , septemb 15the construct gautam buddha intern cricket stadium halt due variou reason resum soon.th construct stadium came halt dhurmus-suntali foundat , led actor sitaram kattel kunjana ghimir , withdrew involv , cite lack fund project.th project taken forward bharatpur metropolitan citi mayor renu dahal pledg complet project . “ complet term mayor bhatartpur , ” said event held.dah explain substanti loan requir complet stadium ’ construct , sinc agreement place govern cover loan , point progress construct becom challenging.dah said construct would carri phases.in april , govern discuss take respons build bharatpur cricket stadium left limbo dhurmu suntali foundat lack funds.construct propos gautam buddha intern cricket stadium began januari 30 , 2019 .', 'nepali home abroad well expat chip money , support foundat financi .', 'everyon hope would nepal ’ well-facilit cricket stadium coupl year .']"
"Fighting out of Nepal, aiming for global MMA stardom","Kathmandu, September 14The Cricket Association of Nepal has decided to hold the general convention and elections on September 22 and 23 in Kathmandu.According to the notice issued by CAN on Thursday, the convention and election will be held at the Everest Hotel in New Baneshwar.This year’s convention will also elect CAN’s new leadership. Officials and members of the central committee, representatives selected from the provincial cricket association, district cricket association, Nepal Umpires and Scorers Association and Nepal Cricket Coaches Association will be allowed to participate in the convention.According to CAN, the district and state conventions have been held before the central convention.Chatur Bahadur Chand, the current president, is gearing up for another run at leadership in CAN. Treasurer Roshan Kumar Singh has also expressed his intention to contend for the presidency.","['fight nepal , aim global mma stardom']","['kathmandu , septemb 14the cricket associ nepal decid hold gener convent elect septemb 22 23 kathmandu.accord notic issu thursday , convent elect held everest hotel new baneshwar.thi year ’ convent also elect ’ new leadership .', 'offici member central committe , repres select provinci cricket associ , district cricket associ , nepal umpir scorer associ nepal cricket coach associ allow particip convention.accord , district state convent held central convention.chatur bahadur chand , current presid , gear anoth run leadership .', 'treasur roshan kumar singh also express intent contend presid .']"
"Chatur Bahadur Chand re-elected as President, Paras Khadka elected CAN’s secretary","The dispute at the All Nepal Football Association (ANFA) has now reached its peak.Due to an insufficient quorum at the special general convention, 49 members, led by former ANFA president Karma Tsering Sherpa, called for the removal of President Pankaj Bikram Nembang and General Secretary Kiran Rai. They insisted on holding another special general convention within a 30-day period.After Nembang declined to accept the proposal, the team presented it to senior vice president Bir Bahadur Khadka. With the majority of members calling for a special general convention and the removal of Nembang and Rai, the leadership of ANFA is now in a state of crisis.Those requesting a special general convention mentioned that according to the ANFA statute, specifically Article 41(1) and Article 27(7), the ANFA Congress holds the authority to make decisions regarding the removal of the president and general secretary.“The current leadership is incompetent. They have not done anything they promised and are wasting everyone’s time. We want them gone,” said Indraman Tuladhar, president of Sankata Club.Tuladhar said the two being at ANFA would pose more risks to the football industry which has already suffered a lot since they took oath of office in June 2022.Key issues at ANFAAs per Article 36 of ANFA’s statute, there exists a provision for convening a special general convention. If 40 per cent of the members submit a written request for such a convention, the working committee is bound to organise it within a 30-day timeframe. In the event that the working committee fails to initiate the special general convention, the members themselves hold the authority to call for it by issuing a 30-day notice.Out of the 86 voters in the recent ANFA elections, 49 have submitted signed applications requesting the association of a special general convention within a 30-day period.During this special convention, the primary agenda will involve the potential removal of President Nembang and General Secretary Rai. According to ANFA regulations, a minimum of 58 votes is needed to oust them from their respective positions.General Secretary Rai, said that even though the application has been submitted, it has yet to be officially registered.“Their application will be registered only after verification,” says Rai. “Once the application is  registered, the special general convention will be called within 30 days.”  Rai also emphasises the importance of examining the legal procedures pertaining to the applications. As the signatures on the proposal are from different people and different clubs, ANFA will check them to for authenticity and proceed ahead.The individuals endorsing a special general convention have levelled allegations against the current ANFA leadership. These allegations include breaches of statutes, an inability to prevent players from moving abroad, a lack of progress in initiating grassroots programs and academies, a failure to ratify the budget during the annual general meeting, and a perceived lack of transparency in financial transactions. “If the current leadership is at the helm, Nepali football will be finished,” reads the proposal.The people calling for the removal of Nembang and Rai have said that even after more than a year in office, the two have consistently undertaken actions that have had a detrimental impact on the integrity of ANFA’s statutes.Boycotting virtual meetingFile: All Nepal Football Association (ANFA)What did not help was the leadership’s call to hold a virtual meeting instead of a physical one. ANFA dispatched a message to all its members, notifying them of the online annual general meeting (AGM) slated for September 10, specifically for the purpose of appointing auditors.However, out of the 42 league clubs, 32 demanded the AGM be held physically, arguing conducting a virtual one contradicts ANFA’s statutes. The clubs cautioned they would boycott the AGM if their request was not accommodated. Nevertheless, the ANFA leadership did not heed this call. Consequently, the majority of members refrained from attending the AGM scheduled for September 10.ANFA had no choice but to postpone the meeting to September 11. However, there was no chance the clubs would be present for an online meeting which meant the quorum was insufficient again.Unsurprisingly there was a stalemate. Following that, ANFA spokesperson Suresh Shah released a statement, indicating that the meeting scheduled for Monday, September 11, has been postponed. Preceding this announcement, the opposition then submitted an application, urging the removal of Nembang and Rai from their respective positions.What have you done?File Photo: Pankaj Bikram Nembang electing Kiran Rai as ANFA’s general secretary.ANFA members like the majority of the fans and football players are growing frustrated with Nembang. He barely held the Martyr’s Memorial ‘A’ Division League which was mired with issues. Unable to conduct the B Division and C Division has been another downside along with the inability to conduct the second round of the National Women’s League and the Lalit Memorial U19 competition. The inaugural U16 Youth League also experienced its share of controversy.The leadership have been put under added pressure as national players started to leave the country citing lack of opportunity and future in football. It has not found a way to deal with this issue nor have they acknowledged it.They have also faced accusations of handling tasks typically reserved for the annual general meeting (AGM) through the working committee.Nembang assumed office as the president of ANFA on June 20, 2022. However, the first meeting of the new leadership’s working committee on June 22 was marred by controversy. The meeting’s legitimacy came into question, as appointments for the positions of general secretary, treasurer, and head of the foreign affairs department were made without a predefined agenda.In a meeting lacking a specified agenda, Kiran Rai was named general secretary, Rabindra Joshi was appointed treasurer, and Nabin Padey was assigned as head of the foreign affairs department. The appointment of Padey sparked a significant dispute, resulting in him ultimately being designated as an advisor to ANFA’s president. Subsequently, Pandey chose to resign from the position.On March 1, ANFA convened a meeting in the absence of a majority of its members and passed 20 resolutions. The opposition has yet to endorse these decisions. Among the decisions made was the appointment of a head coach and coordinators for various committees.Previously, there had been a request to dismiss the general secretary and treasurer. However, the president chose not to include this demand in the agenda.This has led to many people who were with Nembang during the election calling for his removal. Out of the 42 clubs, 32 want him gone. Anil Malla, Bhoj Raj Shahi, Rabin Chand, and Ramesh Byanjakar, who initially backed Nembang during the elections, have now aligned themselves with Karma Tsering Sherpa.","['chatur bahadur chand re-elect presid , para khadka elect ’ secretari']","['disput nepal footbal associ ( anfa ) reach peak.du insuffici quorum special gener convent , 49 member , led former anfa presid karma tsere sherpa , call remov presid pankaj bikram nembang gener secretari kiran rai .', 'insist hold anoth special gener convent within 30-day period.aft nembang declin accept propos , team present senior vice presid bir bahadur khadka .', 'major member call special gener convent remov nembang rai , leadership anfa state crisis.thos request special gener convent mention accord anfa statut , specif articl 41 ( 1 ) articl 27 ( 7 ) , anfa congress hold author make decis regard remov presid gener secretari . “ current leadership incompet .', 'done anyth promis wast everyon ’ time .', 'want gone , ” said indraman tuladhar , presid sankata club.tuladhar said two anfa would pose risk footbal industri alreadi suffer lot sinc took oath offic june 2022.key issu anfaa per articl 36 anfa ’ statut , exist provis conven special gener convent .', '40 per cent member submit written request convent , work committe bound organis within 30-day timefram .', 'event work committe fail initi special gener convent , member hold author call issu 30-day notice.out 86 voter recent anfa elect , 49 submit sign applic request associ special gener convent within 30-day period.dur special convent , primari agenda involv potenti remov presid nembang gener secretari rai .', 'accord anfa regul , minimum 58 vote need oust respect positions.gener secretari rai , said even though applic submit , yet offici regist . “ applic regist verif , ” say rai .', '“ applic regist , special gener convent call within 30 day . ” rai also emphasis import examin legal procedur pertain applic .', 'signatur propos differ peopl differ club , anfa check authent proceed ahead.th individu endors special gener convent level alleg current anfa leadership .', 'alleg includ breach statut , inabl prevent player move abroad , lack progress initi grassroot program academi , failur ratifi budget annual gener meet , perceiv lack transpar financi transact .', '“ current leadership helm , nepali footbal finish , ” read proposal.th peopl call remov nembang rai said even year offic , two consist undertaken action detriment impact integr anfa ’ statutes.boycot virtual meetingfil : nepal footbal associ ( anfa ) help leadership ’ call hold virtual meet instead physic one .', 'anfa dispatch messag member , notifi onlin annual gener meet ( agm ) slate septemb 10 , specif purpos appoint auditors.howev , 42 leagu club , 32 demand agm held physic , argu conduct virtual one contradict anfa ’ statut .', 'club caution would boycott agm request accommod .', 'nevertheless , anfa leadership heed call .', 'consequ , major member refrain attend agm schedul septemb 10.anfa choic postpon meet septemb 11 .', 'howev , chanc club would present onlin meet meant quorum insuffici again.unsurprisingli stalem .', 'follow , anfa spokesperson suresh shah releas statement , indic meet schedul monday , septemb 11 , postpon .', 'preced announc , opposit submit applic , urg remov nembang rai respect positions.what done ? file photo : pankaj bikram nembang elect kiran rai anfa ’ gener secretary.anfa member like major fan footbal player grow frustrat nembang .', 'bare held martyr ’ memori ‘ ’ divis leagu mire issu .', 'unabl conduct b divis c divis anoth downsid along inabl conduct second round nation women ’ leagu lalit memori u19 competit .', 'inaugur u16 youth leagu also experienc share controversy.th leadership put ad pressur nation player start leav countri cite lack opportun futur footbal .', 'found way deal issu acknowledg it.they also face accus handl task typic reserv annual gener meet ( agm ) work committee.nembang assum offic presid anfa june 20 , 2022 .', 'howev , first meet new leadership ’ work committe june 22 mar controversi .', 'meet ’ legitimaci came question , appoint posit gener secretari , treasur , head foreign affair depart made without predefin agenda.in meet lack specifi agenda , kiran rai name gener secretari , rabindra joshi appoint treasur , nabin padey assign head foreign affair depart .', 'appoint padey spark signific disput , result ultim design advisor anfa ’ presid .', 'subsequ , pandey chose resign position.on march 1 , anfa conven meet absenc major member pass 20 resolut .', 'opposit yet endors decis .', 'among decis made appoint head coach coordin variou committees.previ , request dismiss gener secretari treasur .', 'howev , presid chose includ demand agenda.thi led mani peopl nembang elect call remov .', '42 club , 32 want gone .', 'anil malla , bhoj raj shahi , rabin chand , ramesh byanjakar , initi back nembang elect , align karma tsere sherpa .']"

Asian Games 2023: Bahrain come from behind to beat Nepal 3-1 in men’s volleyball,"Sadina Shrestha Photo: Shankar Giri Sadina Shrestha’s phone was ringing non-stop on August 30. As soon as the captain of the national women’s basketball team woke up, people were calling her asking her to watch a specific video which was going viral on social media. Watching the video shocked her. In the video, Bhim Singh Gurung, the acting president of the Nepal Basketball Association, made personal comments about Shrestha, critiquing not only her career but also her lifestyle, going so far as to comment on her attire.“Whatever Sadina Shrestha is today it is just because of the Nepal Basketball Association,” Gurung said on the talk show. “From 0 to Z (top to bottom) she wears branded clothes. Sadina Shrestha is working as a sports teacher at St. Xavier School. I believe that is all due to the Nepal Basketball Association.”He seems particularly unhappy with how Shrestha has been criticising the association.“All she does is criticise it but never says a thing about what she has gained from it. Everyone here has been volunteering. Doesn’t she know that?” he said.Gurung was adamant about how the association was helping the players. He stated how it had played an important role in helping these players get jobs and added how the scene has become better in the past decade.The reality, however, is a far cry and the players know this.When she watched the video, Shrestha was in shock. She did not know how to react. She was angry and frustrated. She knew she had to respond to the remarks made by Gurung and she did that by writing a 708-word long post on Facebook.For a moment, Shrestha could not figure out how to react to the video, but later she took it to social media to vent her frustration and disappointment.“I am in the wrong just because I asked the association to be more accountable and hold more games? Just because I asked a question the (acting) president can question how I dress. How is this right,” she wrote. Sadina Shrestha is deeply hurt and feels disrespected by this entire situation. Having devoted her life to basketball and its development, she deems all of this criticism as unnecessary. She expresses her dismay and states that she is still in shock over Gurung’s comments made on national television.“This was unexpected and uncalled for,” she told Onlinekhabar. “I got this job at St. Xavier through hard work and my passion for developing the game. The association has not done anything to help players like me.”Demanding accountabilitySadina Shrestha has been part of the national women’s basketball team since 2011. Since then, she has been a constant in the team captaining it since then. Photo: Shankar GiriSadina Shrestha has been vocal about the criticising passive nature of the association for not organising adequate numbers of tournaments and providing essential facilities to players. She says this might be why Gurung, who has now become the acting president following the demise of Lama Tendi Sherpa in November 2021.“We’ve been telling the association the same thing time and again. None of our concerns have been addressed. The game is stagnant and it has done nothing to change that. As the captain, it is my duty to question those in the leadership position and speak about these issues,” says Shrestha.She is right. The national women’s basketball team, since the 2019 South Asian Games, has played one international tournament. What has irked Shrestha and players like her is how poor the domestic scene is too. Wanting to change that, she has been consistently demanding the association hold matches at the national level so the team is prepared when it has to play internationally.“Is that too much to ask for?” she questions.Sadina Shrestha has been part of the national women’s basketball team since 2011. Since then, she has been a constant in the team captaining it since then.“After playing basketball for all these years, they do not see my contribution to the national team but the branded clothes that I wear,” says Shrestha.She feels the statement from Gurung was disrespectful as it undermined what she has done in her career. Like many of her peers, she feels she could have left Nepal for a life abroad, but her love for basketball made her stay. Her passion even drove her to obtain an international coaching license, making her the sole woman basketball player in the country to achieve this feat.“Unlike others, I care about basketball and its future,”  says Shrestha.On her ownSadina Shrestha Photo: Shankar Giri Shrestha is taken aback by the silence of the basketball players and coaches regarding the incident. She anticipated that they would openly offer their support to her, but things turned out differently.The men’s team captain, Sadish Pradhan did make a comment on the issue through social media but even he seemed to sit on the fence and be diplomatic. “Players should tell what they feel, as a team captain if we won’t share the problem of our players, who will ?” writes Pradhan on Facebook.  “Having said that I feel, there have also been some positive steps taken for the betterment of basketball in recent days. And to maintain this, the ultimate solution might be joining hands together. Above everything, respecting each other’s efforts and moving forward.” In denialBhim Singh Gurung Gurung has held the position of acting president for the past two years. One of his primary responsibilities in this role was to oversee the election of new committee members, a duty he has seemingly distanced himself from. Sadina Shrestha raises valid questions about the legitimacy of Gurung’s position.Onlinekhabar reached out to Gurung to talk about the incident but he was reluctant to talk about it. “The association has a big dream for basketball so it doesn’t matter who said what,” says Gurung. “We are gearing up to host the Nepal Basketball League for the first time in history and I think our focus should be on that.”The league is due to start on September 29. Gurung said that he has yet to see Shrestha’s post, in which she challenged the statement he made against her on national television.",['asian game 2023 : bahrain come behind beat nepal 3-1 men ’ volleybal'],"['sadina shrestha photo : shankar giri sadina shrestha ’ phone ring non-stop august 30 .', 'soon captain nation women ’ basketbal team woke , peopl call ask watch specif video go viral social media .', 'watch video shock .', 'video , bhim singh gurung , act presid nepal basketbal associ , made person comment shrestha , critiqu career also lifestyl , go far comment attir . “ whatev sadina shrestha today nepal basketbal associ , ” gurung said talk show .', '“ 0 z ( top bottom ) wear brand cloth .', 'sadina shrestha work sport teacher st. xavier school .', 'believ due nepal basketbal associ . ” seem particularli unhappi shrestha criticis associ . “ criticis never say thing gain .', 'everyon volunt .', '’ know ? ” said.gurung adam associ help player .', 'state play import role help player get job ad scene becom better past decade.th realiti , howev , far cri player know this.when watch video , shrestha shock .', 'know react .', 'angri frustrat .', 'knew respond remark made gurung write 708-word long post facebook.for moment , shrestha could figur react video , later took social media vent frustrat disappoint . “ wrong ask associ account hold game ?', 'ask question ( act ) presid question dress .', 'right , ” wrote .', 'sadina shrestha deepli hurt feel disrespect entir situat .', 'devot life basketbal develop , deem critic unnecessari .', 'express dismay state still shock gurung ’ comment made nation televis . “ unexpect uncal , ” told onlinekhabar .', '“ got job st. xavier hard work passion develop game .', 'associ done anyth help player like me . ” demand accountabilitysadina shrestha part nation women ’ basketbal team sinc 2011 .', 'sinc , constant team captain sinc .', 'photo : shankar girisadina shrestha vocal criticis passiv natur associ organis adequ number tournament provid essenti facil player .', 'say might gurung , becom act presid follow demis lama tendi sherpa novemb 2021 . “ ’ tell associ thing time .', 'none concern address .', 'game stagnant done noth chang .', 'captain , duti question leadership posit speak issu , ” say shrestha.sh right .', 'nation women ’ basketbal team , sinc 2019 south asian game , play one intern tournament .', 'irk shrestha player like poor domest scene .', 'want chang , consist demand associ hold match nation level team prepar play intern . “ much ask ? ” questions.sadina shrestha part nation women ’ basketbal team sinc 2011 .', 'sinc , constant team captain sinc then . “ play basketbal year , see contribut nation team brand cloth wear , ” say shrestha.sh feel statement gurung disrespect undermin done career .', 'like mani peer , feel could left nepal life abroad , love basketbal made stay .', 'passion even drove obtain intern coach licens , make sole woman basketbal player countri achiev feat . “ unlik other , care basketbal futur , ” say shrestha.on ownsadina shrestha photo : shankar giri shrestha taken aback silenc basketbal player coach regard incid .', 'anticip would openli offer support , thing turn differently.th men ’ team captain , sadish pradhan make comment issu social media even seem sit fenc diplomat .', '“ player tell feel , team captain ’ share problem player , ? ” write pradhan facebook .', '“ said feel , also posit step taken better basketbal recent day .', 'maintain , ultim solut might join hand togeth .', 'everyth , respect ’ effort move forward . ” denialbhim singh gurung gurung held posit act presid past two year .', 'one primari respons role overse elect new committe member , duti seemingli distanc .', 'sadina shrestha rais valid question legitimaci gurung ’ position.onlinekhabar reach gurung talk incid reluct talk .', '“ associ big dream basketbal ’ matter said , ” say gurung .', '“ gear host nepal basketbal leagu first time histori think focu that . ” leagu due start septemb 29 .', 'gurung said yet see shrestha ’ post , challeng statement made nation televis .']"
Nepal’s 4Merical eSports wins MCB MLBB Champion Battles ,"The Nepali cricket team welcomed at the airport on September 6. After battling it out against two of the best ODI cricket teams in the world, India and Pakistan, the Nepali cricket team returned home on September 6 after taking part in the Asia Cup. As expected, the team was warmly welcomed by eager fans and media upon their arrival at the Tribhuvan International Airport.The excitement surrounding Nepal’s matches against Pakistan and India was evident. Crowds gathered to watch the game, and political leaders shared photos of themselves enjoying the match. What was particularly heartening was witnessing individuals and organisations announcing cash prizes for every four, six, and wicket.Balen Shah, the Mayor of Kathmandu metropolitan city, travelled to Sri Lanka to watch the match against India. Upon his return, he declared that the city would undertake the construction of a stadium, provided the government allocates 12.57 acres of land. He stood out as the sole political leader to pledge investment in infrastructure.Nepali cricket has gone up a level. The team’s performance since February serves as a testament to this progress. Their participation in the Asia Cup further highlighted just how much the cricket team has progressed. Nevertheless, the infrastructure has remained stagnant. This has prompted many to ponder on the potential outcomes if the state had invested in creating a more conducive environment and better facilities for the team.Grounds for progressFile: Underconstruction Mulpani Cricket StadiumThe country only has one proper cricket ground in the country – the TU Cricket Ground. Even that does not have proper facilities as many call it archaic. Mulpani International Cricket Ground, which was envisioned over two decades, is not complete as the country barely holds international level tournaments at the TU Cricket Ground.“The players even have problems training because we do not have proper training facilities,” says Rohit Paudel, captain of the Nepali national cricket team who calls on leaders to develop the infrastructure.Cricket teams of all age groups train at the TU Cricket Ground. There have been instances where three teams either train simultaneously or have to wait for one to conclude before they can begin their training sessions.When Nepal qualified to take part in the World Cup Qualifier in Zimbabwe, Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal announced he would ensure floodlights are set up at the TU Cricket Ground. However, the installation of lights was halted due to a mistake in the tender procedure issued by the National Sports Council. It remains uncertain when the next tender will be issued.The project to build two cricket stadiums at Mulpani has also not been completed. Even though the ground did hold matches during the ACC Premier Cup, the stadium is still not complete 20 years on.Although the government has announced plans to develop the infrastructure of both international stadiums, work has not been carried out. The government while announcing the annual budget for 2022/23 said new cricket stadiums will be built in Biratnagar, Baitadi, Kailali and Kathmandu. However, the plan has not materialised yet.Paudel says the team now needs conditions and pitches to ensure they play better in the international tournaments they take part in. This, he says, will only happen if the country has more cricket grounds.“The game is all about confidence. We need to have pitches that are spin-friendly and pace-friendly so that we can prepare accordingly,” says Paudel.The next stepNepali cricket players during the match against Pakistan on August 30, 2023. Photo: AFP/RSSNepal’s performance against both India and Pakistan was commendable. The scorecard might show it was a one-sided game, but there were instances where Nepal showed they were there for a fight. The Nepali cricket team even caught the eyes of many globally announcing themselves on the biggest stage. This has built the confidence in the players that they can go toe to toe against the best in the world.“While playing against India we tackled a number of short balls.  We played well even when their best ballers were bowling against us,” says Paudel. “The more we play against them, the better we will get.”The Cricket Association of Nepal believes the team can take on anyone after taking on the number one and two ODI teams in the world.“The Nepali cricket team was nervous against Pakistan but the way we stepped up against India was quite amazing. This team and go a long way,” says Pradeep Majgaiyan, the team’s manager.Paudel expressed gratitude on behalf of the team to players such as Paras Khadka, Shakti Gauchan, and others who played instrumental roles in elevating Nepali cricket to new heights. He vowed that this current team would continue to uphold and build upon this legacy.Power of positivityThe head coach of the Nepali cricket team Monty Desai. Photo: Chandra Bahadur AleAfter his appointment as head coach in February, Monty Desai has been promoting the message of a happy dressing room. To ensure everyone is together, he has done a lot. That, the players believe has been key as they have played with a fearless attitude as seen against India.Take Aasif Sheikh’s performance against India. Upon returning to Nepal, Sheikh said how his 58 against India has instilled confidence in him and this was mostly due to Desai’s power of positive thinking.Desai went a step further and personally requested Indian players to present medals to Nepali cricketers who performed well in the match. Sheikh expressed a sense of pride in receiving a medal from cricketing icon Virat Kholi.Along with Sheikh, Sompal Kami and Dipendra Sing Airee were also awarded medals from Hardik Pandya and Rahul Dravid respectively.The team had a great outing at the Asia Cup. Players had interactions with the best in the world who wished them the best. However, the team needs more tha just wishes. They need a better foundation so the next time they play, they can push these teams to the limit.While this tournament provided a valuable learning opportunity, CAN knows the pressing need to invest in the team. The government is also aware of this necessity, and learning opportunity, CAN knows that it needs to invest in the team.

Bharatpur metropolis says it will resume construction of Gautam Buddha International Cricket Stadium soon,"The Nepal cricket team celebrate after winning the ACC Men’s Premier Cup final against the UAE, in Kathmandu, on Tuesday, May 2, 2023. Photo: Aryan Dhimal We all watched with pride as the Nepal cricket team took on cricket powerhouses India and Pakistan in the Asia Cup. While the results might not have been in our favour, the mere presence of our national team on such a prestigious stage was an extraordinary achievement.However, behind this moment of glory lies an incredible journey that deserves to be celebrated. A journey filled with emotions, inspiration, challenges, and unforgettable drama.In every sense, this is a miraculous story.Extraordinary expeditionNepal Cricket Team. Photo: CANThis extraordinary journey began in February when we appointed Monty Desai as the head coach of the Nepal cricket team. At the time, we were second from bottom in the ICC Cricket World Cup League 2 table. For those unfamiliar with this competition, it is a four-year-long cycle determining entry into the World Cup qualifiers.We found ourselves in an almost impossible position: we needed to secure 11 wins out of the remaining 12 games to progress. Our team, led by the young captain Rohit Paudel, embarked on this uphill climb with unwavering determination.On the eve of the first tri-series against Scotland and Namibia, opener Kushal Bhurtel suffered a personal crisis. The situation was serious as she had to be rushed to Kathmandu for treatment.Despite the emotional turmoil, Bhurtel remained resolute. He took the field against Namibia and guided the Nepal cricket team to an awe-inspiring chase of 286, notching up an impressive 115 runs off 113 balls. Nepal clean swept the series beating Namibia and Scotland twice in little over a week.While we were competing in a tri-series in the UAE, the Nepal cricket team faced another crisis. One of our leg spinners, Shyam Dhakal suffered an injury, requiring a replacement. The ICC would only approve the replacement once they received a detailed report from our team physio. However, the physio faced a tough situation as his pregnant wife went into labour in Kathmandu. Balancing his professional duties with this personal crisis was a challenge.Then, Sandeep Lamichhane stepped in. But his inclusion came at a high price. Lamichhane was caught up in a serious personal controversy and faced allegations of raping a minor. His inclusion in the team sparked protests and he encountered hostility both on and off the field.Nevertheless, Lamichhane demonstrated courage and talent, taking 13 wickets in his initial matches. His performances were nothing short of miraculous given the circumstances. Despite the controversies surrounding him, he remained our star performer.Perseverance led pathGulshan Jha after hitting the winning runs against the UAE during the ICC Men’s Cricket World Cup League 2 in Kathmandu on March 16. It is safe to say our path to success was littered with adversity, but we persevered. We went on to win ten out of 11 games, setting the stage for a thrilling showdown against the UAE in a packed TU stadium on March 16. The stage was set. In order to advance to the World Cup Qualifiers in Zimbabwe, the Nepal cricket team faced the daunting task of chasing down 311 runs, marking our highest-ever ODI chase.Thanks to crucial knocks from our middle and lower-middle order, we achieved the impossible. The game hinged on the DLS method, and the TU ground erupted with joy as Gulshan Jha, a young talent, scored 20 runs in the 44th over against UAE skipper Muhammed Waseem. The scenes were surreal, and the memory still sends shivers down our spines.Next, we entered the Asia Cup qualifiers, known as the ACC Men’s Premier Cup, with high hopes. The winner would earn a coveted spot in the Asia Cup, a prestigious cricket competition in Asia. One match worth mentioning was our encounter with Qatar. We had lost nine wickets for 111 runs, seemingly facing defeat.However, our last-wicket partnership pushed us to 157 runs, while we bowled out Qatar for 89. Lamichhane, the man of the match, not only took five wickets but also scored 48 runs. Then came the final, and the rest is history. Despite all odds, Lamichhane was named the Player of the Tournament, a testament to his resilience and cricketing prowess.In the culminateNepali places during the match against Pakistan on August 30, 2023. Photo: AFPWhile our performance in the Asia Cup may not have been stellar, our batters’ courage against pace and our bowlers’ tenacity made an indelible mark. On the world stage, we showcased formidable talent.A year ago, we struggled to secure victories, but today, we boast a formidable batting lineup and a bowling attack that can challenge any opponent globally. Our strength lies in our unity, where every team member plays an equally vital role.We will never forget the contributions of players like Kushal Bhurtel, Aasif Sheikh, Rohit Poudel, Bhim Sharki, Kushal Malla, Dipendra Singh Airee, Aarif Sheikh, Gulshan Jha, Sompal Kami, Karan KC, Sandeep Lamichhane, and Lalit Narayan Rajbanshi. Each one has etched their name into our hearts with remarkable performances.As we continue our journey on the global stage, the world watches with anticipation.

No-confidence motion registered against ANFA president and general secretary,"As untouched and less discussed as the sports management industry is in Nepal, it has ample room to showcase creativity. Photo by Miguel Bruna on UnsplashIn 2023, Barbie named Women in Sports as their career of the year.Whenever I am out and about socially, there is always someone who seems pretty certain about not considering my profession as mainstream. Hold up! Sports as a career? In Nepal? You bet! This article aims to explain why women in this male-dominant sports industry in Nepal should not be viewed as a surprise.I have been part of the Nepali cricket industry in a private capacity for quite a while now. Armed with a Master’s Degree in IT from an American University, my choice to stick with sports management tends to raise eyebrows. While I am not an on-field player, I am definitely behind the scenes, playing strong games of serious deliverance with my team. We are all about creating what is not there.As untouched and less discussed as the sports management industry is in Nepal, it has ample room to showcase creativity. Being a commanding woman in a position can be challenging, but on the brighter side, the gender advantage has yet to fail me. As alien as I might be in sports management in Nepal, I have been accepted with open arms. The nature of the job is highly competitive, no doubt.Embraced by the sports fraternityPhoto: PixabayWomen in sports are safe, heard, and welcomed. I absolutely relish the addition of spirited women to the team. The nuances of sports are something women complement greatly. Sports management inherently rejects narrow minds. There is a lot of travelling, meeting people, experimenting, and remembering limitations. The adjustments are both trivial and clever. Often, in our part of the world, societal norms limit women from making career decisions, hindering them from living life on their terms. This restriction potentially keeps many capable women from pursuing the sports industry, where they could truly wield their power to make an impact. Change is gradual, and I hope to see numerous female faces in charge of stadiums someday in Nepal.Yes, there are challenges. It ranges from personal sacrifices to job security and opportunities. However, these are workable factors for any freelancer in sports management. The key is excelling at our jobs to thrive anywhere. Taking a page from the medical field, the seriousness we apply there should not differ in sports management. Sports is a powerful industry. Children grow up idolising what we showcase on TV. As glorious as the game is, it is every child’s dream to represent their country someday. Carrying that responsibility is our role in sports—an often thankless yet deeply satisfying job.Nepali sports industryThe fans went wild at TU Cricket Ground after Nepal beat UAE.Sports may be a smaller industry in Nepal, but globally, it is a behemoth. The world economy has shifted, and it is time we alter our perspective to recognise the potential of sports as an industry in Nepal. The idea of open commercialisation of sports remains somewhat unexplored, as it continues to be a more exclusive affair in Nepal. By sourcing innovative ideas, there’s a wealth of public attention and investment waiting to be tapped into, along with numerous practices to establish and discard. As the Nepali team achieves international records, the packaging of the sport becomes everything. There is plenty to learn from international sports management to make our industry highly marketable and poised for global entry.Sports such as cricket, football, volleyball, or even golf serve as key intersections for reshaping Nepal’s global narrative. Over the years, Kabaddi has witnessed a substantial surge in India, both in terms of viewership and commercial success. The primary challenge we grapple with is Nepal’s comparatively small market size, posing constraints on our ability to generate substantial economic gains. Therefore, there is unanimous agreement on the imperative for Nepal’s sports to venture onto the international stage.Nepal boasts many hardworking individuals, yet achieving this goal demands specialised talents in sports management with the requisite experience and the capacity to enhance existing values. In the long run, outsourcing such talents may foster dependence. Hence, a concerted effort is needed to inspire Nepali youth to engage in sports management, contributing to our sports ecosystem. There are various ways in which we can harness the potential of sports for our benefit. Encouraging youth involvement can be instrumental in capitalising on the multifaceted opportunities presented by the sports industry.

Nepal Super League (NSL) to kick off on November 24,"Painting ‘My Private Life’ by artist Priyam Pradhan at the exhibition Mani at Siddhartha Art Gallery, Baber Mahal. Photo: Chandra Bahadur AleUsing Pitt’s artist pen on paper, artist Priyam Pradhan presents My Private Life, a showcase of the current significance of his life depicted in abstract form.At the centre of the painting is a 1000-rupee note, within which Pradhan has intricately painted Lord Krishna, a man wearing a hoodie tenderly embracing his dog, and a woman. The woman stands tall, elongated in form. Towards the bottom of the canvas, a holy man reaches out his hands, appearing to be in flight.Priyam Pradhan has used a vibrant colour palette, incorporating bright hues such as pink, orange, and yellow, as well as green, black, white, and grey. This combination adds a dynamic and lively quality to the artwork.“The man in the centre is me and the girl in green is my girlfriend. And the faces are my mom and dad,” says Pradhan. “The sadhu (holy man) symbolises my desires that I don’t have many desires for materialistic things however I do understand the value of money.”The use of colours, figures and lines in an abstract form in his painting resembles the painting of American painter Paul Jackson Pollock. Like his abstract expressionism, Pradhan has expressed himself in his painting.Furthermore, this marks Priyam Pradhan’s third solo painting exhibition titled Mani (money), inaugurated on January 17 at Siddhartha Art Gallery, Baber Mahal.In his previous exhibitions, Pradhan’s artworks centred around Hindu philosophy and his spontaneous thought process. However, in this latest exhibition, he explores the theme of money and its impact on an individual’s life, delving into the reverberating effects of financial aspects.Understanding the value of moneyPaintings by artist Priyam Pradhan at Siddhartha Art Gallery, Baber Mahal. Photo: Chandra Bahadur AleAny form of art is known as a reflection of the contemporary time. Likewise, Priyam Pradhan’s paintings reflect the lifestyle, desires, obligations and more of today’s younger generation living in urban areas in Nepal.Pradhan himself is in his 20s and he has justified the want of most of the youngsters in their 20s, who might be declared adults and understand the need for money and materialistic things but are still kids at their heart who want to explore and experience life as much as possible.The exhibition has 27 paintings which Pradhan took around nine months to complete. According to him, while he was travelling the idea that his life was luxurious and him being capable of exploring anything he wanted to was because of money.And being an artist this concept lingered on him and he was compelled to create on the theme of money.Once you enter the gallery, you can also view an animated video, which introduces artist Pradhan and the importance of money, which is on the ground floor. On the first floor, a huge painting (193×62 in cm) Apatkalin Awastha using mixed media on canvas welcomes you and other paintings are small in size (18×30 in cm).“It is a team work and it is my introduction as an artist for the exhibition,” he says. “Also, being a recent multimedia graduate from Islington College, I wanted to explore my skills and I got my team. Then, like money, multimedia is relevant to current society.”Experiencing life through artPainting by artist Priyam Pradhan at Siddhartha Art Gallery, Baber Mahal. Photo: Chandra Bahadur Ale Priyam Pradhan says enjoyment is the meaning of life and he enjoys creating artwork. Moreover, Pradhan who came into the art world first being a tattoo artist feels blessed that he has the privilege to explore whatever he likes in his life.He also believes that the philosophy that says one should not be materialistic is wrong. “If material things are not important, why would one build a house? And after building a house why do they want to decorate their house?” he questions.Alongside, money and materialistic things, his paintings also explore love, romance, life and childhood experiences. Motifs like Pokemon, ramen noodles, animals, dancers, etc have been used in his paintings. In most of his paintings, he has used numerous white lines in wavy form and these lines for Pradhan indicate the sound or the energy that exists in the surroundings all the time.About using a pitta artist pen, he says, “I have enjoyed drawing and painting since my childhood and using a pitta artist pen helps me revisit that feeling of happiness and sense of freedom.”So many things happening on the canvas with the use of vibrant colours gives a sense of excitement to the viewers. Though referencing artists like Pollock, MF Husain, Picasso and more, his pen strokes give a sense of newness through his expression and thoughts about his life experiences.In his paintings, these bright colours and motifs are in harmony and are visual treats that can surely cheer up the mood of any visitor.

Sadina Shrestha’s rift with Nepal Basketball Association president shows how poor leadership is affecting the growth of the sport,"Entrepreneurship education is not just an investment in the education system; it is an investment in the nation’s future prosperity. Photo: Pexels/ Rodnae ProductionsIn the shadow of the towering Himalayas, Nepal faces a challenge that rivals the steepness of its mountainous terrain- the challenge of economic development. As the nation earnestly pursues its Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), it becomes increasingly evident that a transformation in the education system is not only necessary but also urgent. Rooted in common living strategies, the prevailing education model, especially in higher education, may not adequately prepare the youth for the demands of the modern world. In this critical juncture, the incorporation of entrepreneurship education emerges as a beacon of hope, offering a pathway towards a self-reliant and prosperous Nepal.Time to reevaluate the education systemNepal’s journey towards economic prosperity has been marked by challenges that demand innovative solutions. The commitment of the SDGs reflects not only a global responsibility but also a domestic imperative for sustainable development. For this, it is high time to reevaluate the education system in the country.The current education system in Nepal, deeply entrenched in common living strategies, has been the foundation of learning for generations. However, in the face of a rapidly evolving world, today’s generation aspires for more than the status quo. The call for independence reverberates through the aspirations of youth who seek a curriculum fostering critical thinking, innovation and entrepreneurial skills.Entrepreneurship education is a dynamic force capable of reshaping Nepal’s educational landscape. This innovative approach moves beyond traditional learning methods, providing students with the tools to navigate the complexities of the modern world. At its core, entrepreneurship education is about empowering students to implement learned information in practical and tangible ways.Consider a student engrossed in the intricacies of sensor systems during a science class, entrepreneurship education transforms this theoretical knowledge into practical applications, inspiring the creation of a sensor-operated door. Such innovation born from a fusion of science and entrepreneurship becomes a valuable mindset in solving practical problems.  Expanding the horizons of entrepreneurship education, let us delve into chemistry. Imagine students studying chemistry not just as a theoretical subject, but also as entrepreneurs in the making. Armed with entrepreneurial principles, these students can tap into Nepal’s rich biodiversity, exploring market demands for products derived from local plants.In the scenario, chemistry students could embark on a journey to develop performance-enhancing products based on market demand, harnessing the potential of indigenous flora. What makes this approach remarkable is that it does not necessarily require sophisticated machines or extensive human resources. Instead, it leverages the inherent skills and awareness of individuals within the community, paving the way for a grassroots economic revolution.Entrepreneurship in education Representational graphic. Image: FreepikThe beauty of entrepreneurship education lies in its universal applicability. It is not confined to science or chemistry alone. Consider an art student, for example. Through entrepreneurship education, they can understand what art to develop (product), how much to set the price (price), where to sell (place) and how to sell (promote) their artworks. Every subject becomes a canvas for innovation and enterprise.Moreover, entrepreneurship education is a powerful equaliser, recognising the unique skills and talents of individuals across various disciplines. It is not about fitting into a predefined mould but rather about unleashing the potential within each student. When every single person is aware of their skills and potential, they can rise to different levels, contributing to the overall progress of the nation.Entrepreneurship education goes beyond skill recognition; it is about nurturing the ability to produce goods and mastering the art of marketing. Returning to the example of the student developing a sensor-operated door, entrepreneurship education not only equips them to produce the product but also teaches them how to navigate the complexities of marketing it to potential users and clients.The impact of entrepreneurship education extends beyond individual success stories; it reverberates through the entire nation. A generation equipped with entrepreneurial skills becomes a driving force for economic growth and independence. They will be able to recognise the resources and ideas to utilise them to reach the global market. They will be able to be the pioneers in products and contribute to the economy. By fostering a culture of innovation, creativity and self-reliance, Nepal can reduce its dependence on external sources and strengthen its economy from within.In essence, entrepreneurship education is not just an investment in the education system; it is an investment in the nation’s future prosperity. It is a transformative force that has the potential to shape a generation of independent thinkers, innovators and entrepreneurs- the architects of a self-reliant and economically vibrant Nepal. Entrepreneurship education, by teaching students to utilise available resources (physical and financial) and make them commercial, becomes a cornerstone in the nation’s journey towards economic empowerment and independence.",['sadina shrestha ’ rift nepal basketbal associ presid show poor leadership affect growth sport'],"['entrepreneurship educ invest educ system ; invest nation ’ futur prosper .', 'photo : pexels/ rodna productionsin shadow tower himalaya , nepal face challeng rival steep mountain terrain- challeng econom develop .', 'nation earnestli pursu sustain develop goal ( sdg ) , becom increasingli evid transform educ system necessari also urgent .', 'root common live strategi , prevail educ model , especi higher educ , may adequ prepar youth demand modern world .', 'critic junctur , incorpor entrepreneurship educ emerg beacon hope , offer pathway toward self-reli prosper nepal.tim reevalu educ systemnep ’ journey toward econom prosper mark challeng demand innov solut .', 'commit sdg reflect global respons also domest imper sustain develop .', ', high time reevalu educ system country.th current educ system nepal , deepli entrench common live strategi , foundat learn gener .', 'howev , face rapidli evolv world , today ’ gener aspir statu quo .', 'call independ reverber aspir youth seek curriculum foster critic think , innov entrepreneuri skills.entrepreneurship educ dynam forc capabl reshap nepal ’ educ landscap .', 'innov approach move beyond tradit learn method , provid student tool navig complex modern world .', 'core , entrepreneurship educ empow student implement learn inform practic tangibl ways.consid student engross intricaci sensor system scienc class , entrepreneurship educ transform theoret knowledg practic applic , inspir creation sensor-oper door .', 'innov born fusion scienc entrepreneurship becom valuabl mindset solv practic problem .', 'expand horizon entrepreneurship educ , let us delv chemistri .', 'imagin student studi chemistri theoret subject , also entrepreneur make .', 'arm entrepreneuri principl , student tap nepal ’ rich biodivers , explor market demand product deriv local plants.in scenario , chemistri student could embark journey develop performance-enhanc product base market demand , har potenti indigen flora .', 'make approach remark necessarili requir sophist machin extens human resourc .', 'instead , leverag inher skill awar individu within commun , pave way grassroot econom revolution.entrepreneurship educ represent graphic .', 'imag : freepikth beauti entrepreneurship educ lie univers applic .', 'confin scienc chemistri alon .', 'consid art student , exampl .', 'entrepreneurship educ , understand art develop ( product ) , much set price ( price ) , sell ( place ) sell ( promot ) artwork .', 'everi subject becom canva innov enterprise.moreov , entrepreneurship educ power equalis , recognis uniqu skill talent individu across variou disciplin .', 'fit predefin mould rather unleash potenti within student .', 'everi singl person awar skill potenti , rise differ level , contribut overal progress nation.entrepreneurship educ goe beyond skill recognit ; nurtur abil produc good master art market .', 'return exampl student develop sensor-oper door , entrepreneurship educ equip produc product also teach navig complex market potenti user clients.th impact entrepreneurship educ extend beyond individu success stori ; reverber entir nation .', 'gener equip entrepreneuri skill becom drive forc econom growth independ .', 'abl recognis resourc idea utilis reach global market .', 'abl pioneer product contribut economi .', 'foster cultur innov , creativ self-reli , nepal reduc depend extern sourc strengthen economi within.in essenc , entrepreneurship educ invest educ system ; invest nation ’ futur prosper .', 'transform forc potenti shape gener independ thinker , innov entrepreneurs- architect self-reli econom vibrant nepal .', 'entrepreneurship educ , teach student utilis avail resourc ( physic financi ) make commerci , becom cornerston nation ’ journey toward econom empower independ .']"

Women’s T20 World Cup Asia Qualifier: Thailand beat Nepal to qualify for the global qualifier,"Ram Bujhaun Yadav with his land ownership certificate stands near a border pillar which he says was erroneously placed on his land. In October 2023, when 51-year-old Ram Bujhaun Yadav of Musaharnia Rural Municipality-5, Mukhiyapatti, Dhanusha, was at a relative’s house, someone told him that two Indian Sashastra Seema Bal (SSB) personnel were looking for him.Anxious, he rushed home wondering why they were looking for him.“They asked me if the paddy field in the no man’s land was mine. I told them yes and they asked me to cut down the paddy immediately,” he said.The paddy was not ripe and Yadav asked them for some time. However, the SSB personnel told him he had to cut down his paddy immediately.Ram Bujhaun and his wife Tetari Devi each own a 677-square-metre plot of land. As Nepal and India reevaluated the border, Ram Bujhan’s land was been deemed to be near the no man’s land as it now has two demarcation pillars.Frustrated, Ram Bujhaun cut the paddy before it was due to be harvested. Now, he has been asked to not plant anything on the land as it falls in the no man’s land.“Our border police don’t say a word. I can’t fight the SSB on my own,” says Ram Bujhaun adding he had decided not to plan anything on the land anymore.Woes of the farmersMany farmers in southern Nepal say their land has now been placed in India after the recent demarcation. When the Jamuna River, which flows through the no man’s land between Nepal and India, changed its course some two decades ago, some border pillars went missing. Locals say these pillars have now been placed encroaching on Nepali land.In 2018, with the then Chief District Officer of Dhanusha, Pradeep Raj Kandel, and an official from Madhubani district, Bihar, India, a team that included border security forces from both countries, the Armed Police Force of Nepal, and SSB of India began placing border pillars after land measurement by technicians.Locals have raised concerns, stating that border pillars have been positioned, encroaching approximately 50 to 100 meters of land into Nepal compared to the previous position. Many like Ram Bujhaun are unaware of when these border pillars were placed.“I did not know that pillar was placed here. After I found out when I asked the village leaders, many said they were placing the border pillars as they pleased,” said Ram Bujhaun.He was told to carry on planting paddy and that it would not matter as these issues had happened in the past. “They encroached on my land and have asked me not to plant anything. This is gross injustice,” he says.Ram Bujhaun’s family owns a total of 4,000 square metres of land, with 2,000 square metres belonging to him and the remaining 2,000 square metres to his brother Bechan. However, 1,000 square metres of his land is now located on the Indian side after the demarcation. Despite this, he has been farming on the land and continues to pay taxes to the Department of Land Management and Archive in Nepal.“They have marked my land to be on the Indian side and placed border pillars on it. I’ve been farming till now but I don’t know when they will ask me to stop,” he says.Ignorance of the governmentThe Madhesh province in southern NepalThe former ward chair of Mukhiyapatti Musharniya Rural Municipality-5, Ram Naresh Yadav, said that over time, India has encroached on numerous Nepali lands in various locations in the Madhesh Province. This, he says, happened due to the Nepali administration’s ignorance and weak stature.“They (Nepali administration) were careless and that meant the Indian side placed these border pillars by encroaching on Nepali land,” says Ram Naresh.He said that over 40 farmers from wards 1, 5, and 6 have land ranging from 300 to 1,600 square metres on the Indian side. “These farmers have land ownership certificates, but they cannot farm as the SSB says the land is in India and not Nepal,” said Ram Naresh.In 1996, land ownership certificates were distributed after surveying the land in the border area. Local Dharmendra Kumar Yadav said that since then, the locals have been paying their land tax regularly. In 2018, when the pillar was being placed, the locals protested when they saw their land was being encroached on. However, since the demarcation had been agreed upon by high-ranking government officials of Nepal and India, the farmer’s voices went unheard.“We tried to stop when the border pillars were being placed on our land. But the administrators from both sides forcibly put it there without even trying to hold a discussion,” said Harish Chandra Yadav. The Chief District Officer of Dhanusha, Chakrapani Pandey, says that the border pillars were placed by the technical team after the measurements and with the agreement of the high-ranking officials of the two countries.“The fields and houses that are built in no man’s land have recently been cleared. No one can do anything in this particular area,” said Pandey. “We understand the people’s concern but we cannot do anything about it now.”",['women ’ t20 world cup asia qualifi : thailand beat nepal qualifi global qualifi'],"['ram bujhaun yadav land ownership certif stand near border pillar say erron place land .', 'octob 2023 , 51-year-old ram bujhaun yadav musaharnia rural municipality-5 , mukhiyapatti , dhanusha , rel ’ hous , someon told two indian sashastra seema bal ( ssb ) personnel look him.anxi , rush home wonder look him . “ ask paddi field man ’ land mine .', 'told ye ask cut paddi immedi , ” said.th paddi ripe yadav ask time .', 'howev , ssb personnel told cut paddi immediately.ram bujhaun wife tetari devi 677-square-metr plot land .', 'nepal india reevalu border , ram bujhan ’ land deem near man ’ land two demarc pillars.frustr , ram bujhaun cut paddi due harvest .', ', ask plant anyth land fall man ’ land . “ border polic ’ say word .', '’ fight ssb , ” say ram bujhaun ad decid plan anyth land anymore.wo farmersmani farmer southern nepal say land place india recent demarc .', 'jamuna river , flow man ’ land nepal india , chang cours two decad ago , border pillar went miss .', 'local say pillar place encroach nepali land.in 2018 , chief district offic dhanusha , pradeep raj kandel , offici madhubani district , bihar , india , team includ border secur forc countri , arm polic forc nepal , ssb india began place border pillar land measur technicians.loc rais concern , state border pillar posit , encroach approxim 50 100 meter land nepal compar previou posit .', 'mani like ram bujhaun unawar border pillar place . “ know pillar place .', 'found ask villag leader , mani said place border pillar pleas , ” said ram bujhaun.h told carri plant paddi would matter issu happen past .', '“ encroach land ask plant anyth .', 'gross injustic , ” says.ram bujhaun ’ famili own total 4,000 squar metr land , 2,000 squar metr belong remain 2,000 squar metr brother bechan .', 'howev , 1,000 squar metr land locat indian side demarc .', 'despit , farm land continu pay tax depart land manag archiv nepal . “ mark land indian side place border pillar .', '’ farm till ’ know ask stop , ” says.ignor governmentth madhesh provinc southern nepalth former ward chair mukhiyapatti musharniya rural municipality-5 , ram naresh yadav , said time , india encroach numer nepali land variou locat madhesh provinc .', ', say , happen due nepali administr ’ ignor weak statur . “ ( nepali administr ) careless meant indian side place border pillar encroach nepali land , ” say ram naresh.h said 40 farmer ward 1 , 5 , 6 land rang 300 1,600 squar metr indian side .', '“ farmer land ownership certif , farm ssb say land india nepal , ” said ram naresh.in 1996 , land ownership certif distribut survey land border area .', 'local dharmendra kumar yadav said sinc , local pay land tax regularli .', '2018 , pillar place , local protest saw land encroach .', 'howev , sinc demarc agre upon high-rank govern offici nepal india , farmer ’ voic went unheard . “ tri stop border pillar place land .', 'administr side forcibl put without even tri hold discuss , ” said harish chandra yadav .', 'chief district offic dhanusha , chakrapani pandey , say border pillar place technic team measur agreement high-rank offici two countri . “ field hous built man ’ land recent clear .', 'one anyth particular area , ” said pandey .', '“ understand peopl ’ concern anyth . ”']"
Women’s T20 World Cup Asia Qualifier: Nepal to play Thailand in the semi-final after rain abandons crunch UAE tie,"Regenerative braking representational image. Photo: FreepikThe electric vehicle market in Nepal has grown significantly over the past year. Electric four-wheelers and two-wheelers are being launched almost every month, spanning from passenger to commercial vehicles. Electric transportation appears to be an emerging trend in the automotive industry.New EVs are regularly introduced with advanced features as car companies develop unique electric platforms. One standout feature is regenerative braking.Regenerative braking was first introduced in 1967 by the American Motor Car Company (AMC) in their prototype electric vehicle, the AMC Amitron. However, Toyota became the automobile manufacturer to implement regenerative braking system (RBS) technology in their Prius series hybrid vehicles in 1997. Toyota brought up the new hybrid technology in the Prius when fuel prices were going up at a massive rate. 1997 Toyota Prius Hybrid. Photo: ToyotaBut what is regenerative braking? There are still many people confused about what it is, whether it is safe or helpful in fuel economy in hybrid cars and the regeneration of electricity in electric cars.In simple terms, regen braking is when a car saves energy by recharging its battery when you brake, helping it use less fuel or electricity and go further. Easy but scientifically, regen braking is a process used in vehicles where the kinetic energy produced during braking is converted into electrical energy through an electric motor acting as a generator. This electrical energy is then stored in the vehicle’s battery for later use, reducing energy wastage and increasing overall efficiency.Photo: FreepikRegen braking can be seen in all kinds of EVs, including cars, scooters, commercial vans, buses, bicycles, three-wheelers, and rickshaws. It now can be electrically managed to what extent the power and braking can be generated. Regenerative Braking work process in EVPrinciple of Operation: Regene braking works by turning the energy from slowing down into electricity.Electric Motor as a Generator: In EV or hybrid cars with regen braking, the motor changes roles from moving the car to making electricity when you brake.Switching Polarity: When you brake, the motor switches directions, turning energy from the wheels into electricity instead of using it to move the car.Generation of Electricity: The turning wheels make the motor produce electricity, which goes to the car’s battery.Power Electronics: Special electronics change the electricity from the motor into the right kind for charging the battery.Battery Charging: The electricity made during braking charges up the car’s battery, storing the energy for later.Integration with Hydraulic Braking System: Regenerative braking works with the regular brakes, blending them for smooth stopping.Photo: automotive-iqAdvantages and Disadvantages of Regenerative Braking The advantages are listed below:Energy Efficiency: Regenerative braking efficiently captures the kinetic energy generated during braking, effectively reducing energy wastage and contributing to a more sustainable driving experience.Extended Range: By using the energy that would otherwise be lost during braking as heat and sound, regenerative braking helps to extend the driving range of electric vehicles in instances such as travelling downhill. Reduced Brake Wear: Regenerative braking minimizes the strain on traditional braking components, mitigating wear and tear, and potentially extending the lifespan of the braking components such as brake pads, rotors and brake lines, thus reducing maintenance costs over time.Enhanced Driving Experience: Regenerative braking provides a smoother braking experience and a more responsive feel to drivers, enhancing overall driving comfort and control on the road.The disadvantages are listed below:Limited Effectiveness at Low Speeds: While regenerative braking efficiently recaptures energy during braking, its effectiveness diminishes at lower speeds which leads to decreased energy recovery compared to higher speeds.Complexity and Cost: Implementing regenerative braking adds complexity and cost to vehicle systems, potentially raising manufacturing and maintenance expenses, and impacting consumer affordability.Maintenance Requirements: Regenerative braking systems require periodic maintenance and calibration to ensure they operate optimally.Efficiency Variability: Regenerative braking may exhibit variability in efficiency under extreme weather conditions or on certain road surfaces, leading to fluctuations in overall energy recapture and impacting the vehicle’s efficiency.MisconceptionsFully Recharges Battery: Some mistakenly believe that regenerative braking fully replenishes the battery, but in reality, it only adds a modest amount of charge.Increases Braking Distances: There is a misconception that regenerative braking extends braking distances, but it enhances braking performance by complementing traditional brakes.High-Speed Only: While more effective at higher speeds, regenerative braking still functions at lower speeds, such as during city driving or stop-and-go traffic.Maintenance-Free: Despite requiring less maintenance than traditional brakes, regen braking systems still need periodic checks and maintenance to ensure proper operation.Significantly Boosts Range: While regen braking contributes to extending the driving range of electric vehicles, its impact is influenced by various factors beyond just braking efficiency.Only for Electric Cars: Although commonly associated with electric vehicles, regen braking systems are also found in some conventional vehicles, particularly those aiming to improve fuel efficiency with advanced technology.Photo: FreepikRegenerative braking might sound complicated, but it is pretty cool. Think of it as a way for EVs and hybrids to recycle energy when they slow down. Instead of just wasting that energy, regenerative braking turns it into electricity, which can then be used to power the battery.",['women ’ t20 world cup asia qualifi : nepal play thailand semi-fin rain abandon crunch uae tie'],"['regen brake represent imag .', 'photo : freepikth electr vehicl market nepal grown significantli past year .', 'electr four-wheel two-wheel launch almost everi month , span passeng commerci vehicl .', 'electr transport appear emerg trend automot industry.new ev regularli introduc advanc featur car compani develop uniqu electr platform .', 'one standout featur regen braking.regen brake first introduc 1967 american motor car compani ( amc ) prototyp electr vehicl , amc amitron .', 'howev , toyota becam automobil manufactur implement regen brake system ( rb ) technolog priu seri hybrid vehicl 1997 .', 'toyota brought new hybrid technolog priu fuel price go massiv rate .', '1997 toyota priu hybrid .', 'photo : toyotabut regen brake ?', 'still mani peopl confus , whether safe help fuel economi hybrid car regener electr electr cars.in simpl term , regen brake car save energi recharg batteri brake , help use less fuel electr go .', 'easi scientif , regen brake process use vehicl kinet energi produc brake convert electr energi electr motor act gener .', 'electr energi store vehicl ’ batteri later use , reduc energi wastag increas overal efficiency.photo : freepikregen brake seen kind ev , includ car , scooter , commerci van , buse , bicycl , three-wheel , rickshaw .', 'electr manag extent power brake gener .', 'regen brake work process evprincipl oper : regen brake work turn energi slow electricity.electr motor gener : ev hybrid car regen brake , motor chang role move car make electr brake.switch polar : brake , motor switch direct , turn energi wheel electr instead use move car.gener electr : turn wheel make motor produc electr , goe car ’ battery.pow electron : special electron chang electr motor right kind charg battery.batteri charg : electr made brake charg car ’ batteri , store energi later.integr hydraul brake system : regen brake work regular brake , blend smooth stopping.photo : automotive-iqadvantag disadvantag regen brake advantag list : energi effici : regen brake effici captur kinet energi gener brake , effect reduc energi wastag contribut sustain drive experience.extend rang : use energi would otherwis lost brake heat sound , regen brake help extend drive rang electr vehicl instanc travel downhil .', 'reduc brake wear : regen brake minim strain tradit brake compon , mitig wear tear , potenti extend lifespan brake compon brake pad , rotor brake line , thu reduc mainten cost time.enhanc drive experi : regen brake provid smoother brake experi respons feel driver , enhanc overal drive comfort control road.th disadvantag list : limit effect low speed : regen brake effici recaptur energi brake , effect diminish lower speed lead decreas energi recoveri compar higher speeds.complex cost : implement regen brake add complex cost vehicl system , potenti rais manufactur mainten expens , impact consum affordability.mainten requir : regen brake system requir period mainten calibr ensur oper optimally.effici variabl : regen brake may exhibit variabl effici extrem weather condit certain road surfac , lead fluctuat overal energi recaptur impact vehicl ’ efficiency.misconceptions recharg batteri : mistakenli believ regen brake fulli replenish batteri , realiti , add modest amount charge.increas brake distanc : misconcept regen brake extend brake distanc , enhanc brake perform complement tradit brakes.high-spe : effect higher speed , regen brake still function lower speed , citi drive stop-and-go traffic.maintenance-fre : despit requir less mainten tradit brake , regen brake system still need period check mainten ensur proper operation.significantli boost rang : regen brake contribut extend drive rang electr vehicl , impact influenc variou factor beyond brake efficiency.onli electr car : although commonli associ electr vehicl , regen brake system also found convent vehicl , particularli aim improv fuel effici advanc technology.photo : freepikregen brake might sound complic , pretti cool .', 'think way ev hybrid recycl energi slow .', 'instead wast energi , regen brake turn electr , use power batteri .']"

But in the gush of excitement to take exclusive photographs of the elusive cat, difficult to spot even in its prime habitats, there were few takers for the word of caution.Nepal’s Department of National Parks and Wildlife Conservation (DNPWC) organised the photo-op two days after the male subadult cat, which was until recently found in the country only at altitudes higher than 2,000-6,000 metres above sea level, was brought to the zoo from Urlabari town(146 m above sea level). According to the department, the animal has sustained injuries to its right foreleg and cannot stand upright.Although officials involved said they are looking at releasing the animal into the wild after it recuperates, doing so will be a daunting task, adding that the zoo may be the only place where it can now survive.Not a wild catReporters and photojournalists take photos of a snow leopard being held at the Central Zoo in Lalitpur, Nepal. Image by Abhaya Raj Joshi/ Mongabay“Nepali snow leopard experts have come up with two hypotheses to explain how the animal from the mountains landed up in the plains,” said Sharad Chandra Adhikari, member-secretary at the National Trust for Nature Conservation (NTNC), a semi-government body that manages the zoo in Lalitpur, a town in the Kathmandu Valley. The first of the two hypotheses made public during the photo-op-cum-press conference, is that it was raised in captivity and somehow managed to escape into the wild. The second is that it lost its orientation while trying to establish its territory after separating from its mother.Kulbhushansingh Suryawanshi, director of the India program, Snow Leopard Trust, said that both hypotheses are plausible explanations as to how the snow leopard got to the plains in Nepal.A DNPWC official, who wished to remain anonymous as he is not authorised to talk to the press, said that it was more likely that the animal had been raised in captivity. “The way it sipped the water and ate the food zoo staff offered indicates that it may have been raised in captivity,” the official said.Snow leopards are shy cats living at extreme altitudes in the steep mountainous areas of 12 countries in Central and South Asia. Their global population spread over altitudes of 500-5,800 m, is estimated to be between around 3,900 and 6,000 as detailed coordinated surveys of the population in the range countries are yet to be carried out. In Nepal, their population divided into three blocks (eastern, central and western) is estimated to be between 301 and 400.Adhikari from NTNC said that researchers will now examine the animal’s scat to analyse its diet and try to find out whether it was roaming in the wild or had been in some sort of captivity. Researchers are also preparing to analyse its genes to try to find out to which of the three metapopulations in Nepal it belongs. They will also observe the animal’s canine teeth and fur to look for clues.Relocation challenge A snow leopard found in Urlabari town in Nepal’s plains in a cage at the Central Zoo in Kathmandu. Photo: Aryan DhimalThe whole process could take a few months to complete, and summer could set in in Kathmandu by then, officials concede. “The current temperature in Kathmandu is suitable for snow leopards, as we are in the peak of winter,” said Madhu Chetri, a snow leopard researcher from NTNC. But that could change as spring season begins in the Northern Hemisphere.The DNPWC official said that regardless of the findings related to how the animal got to Urlabarli, the animal would have spent a significant amount of time with humans during its recovery phase. “That would mean that it would have gotten habituated with having humans around,” the official said.Sending such animals back into the wild is a challenge, as they may have lost their hunting and other adaptation skills, he added. In May last year, officials at the Chitwan National Park released two rescued rhino calves into the wild, with limited success. The safety of the animals, which had gotten used to having humans around, was compromised as poachers could easily approach and kill them. Eventually, they were transferred to an enclosure in eastern Nepal away from human intervention.Veteran conservationist Professor Karan Bahadur Shah said that rewilding the snow leopard would be a daunting task, as the animals are territorial. “If we just leave the animal in its natural habitat, it will get killed by other snow leopards defending their territory,” he said. “The best option would be to keep the animal in the zoo for the public to see.”But Nepal’s Central Zoo has its own set of problems. The facility, established in 1932 as a private collection, has limited space and has frequently run into financial trouble. Conservationists say the snow leopard would need special facilities to cater to its needs.“If the government decides that the snow leopard needs to remain at the zoo, we are ready to shoulder the responsibility,” said Adhikari. “We have set up special facilities for animals such as the red panda and chimpanzees,” he said. “We can do that for the snow leopard as well.”Those advocating for keeping the animal in the zoo also said that Nepal is a snow leopard range country and the public, especially the young generation, also needs to see the different animals found in the country. “It has great educational value,” said Shah.Snow leopard expert Suryawanshi from neighbouring India also said that it would be challenging to release the animal into the wild. “If the team at the zoo can establish the exact cause of this behaviour [why it ventured into the plains] and can keep the animal away from human contact, then it might be okay to release it back,” he said. “But otherwise, there is little hope for it in the wild. Better to let it live in the zoo.”Back at the zoo, after the photojournalists are done taking photos, it is the turn of the reporters to point their smartphones at the animal. Then there is a contingent of senior wildlife department officials waiting in line to catch a glimpse of the animal. “So much for keeping it away from human contact,” a conservationist observing the hullabaloo from a distance said.This story first appeared on Mongabay and Onlinekhabar is republishing it under a Creative Commons licence.",['nepal ’ volleybal player receiv monthli salari first time'],"['snow leopard rescu urlabari current kept central zoo lalitpur .', 'photo : aryan dhimala gate vet clinic central zoo lalitpur open , two dozen photojournalist throng facil surround metal cage aim dslr camera snow leopard insid . “ pleas ’ come close anim , ” zoo ’ vet , radha krishna gharti , told approach photojournalist .', 'gush excit take exclus photograph elus cat , difficult spot even prime habitat , taker word caution.nep ’ depart nation park wildlif conserv ( dnpwc ) organis photo-op two day male subadult cat , recent found countri altitud higher 2,000-6,000 metr sea level , brought zoo urlabari town ( 146 sea level ) .', 'accord depart , anim sustain injuri right foreleg stand upright.although offici involv said look releas anim wild recuper , daunt task , ad zoo may place survive.not wild catreport photojournalist take photo snow leopard held central zoo lalitpur , nepal .', 'imag abhaya raj joshi/ mongabay “ nepali snow leopard expert come two hypothes explain anim mountain land plain , ” said sharad chandra adhikari , member-secretari nation trust natur conserv ( ntnc ) , semi-govern bodi manag zoo lalitpur , town kathmandu valley .', 'first two hypothes made public photo-op-cum-press confer , rais captiv somehow manag escap wild .', 'second lost orient tri establish territori separ mother.kulbhushansingh suryawanshi , director india program , snow leopard trust , said hypothes plausibl explan snow leopard got plain nepal.a dnpwc offici , wish remain anonym authoris talk press , said like anim rais captiv .', '“ way sip water ate food zoo staff offer indic may rais captiv , ” offici said.snow leopard shi cat live extrem altitud steep mountain area 12 countri central south asia .', 'global popul spread altitud 500-5,800 , estim around 3,900 6,000 detail coordin survey popul rang countri yet carri .', 'nepal , popul divid three block ( eastern , central western ) estim 301 400.adhikari ntnc said research examin anim ’ scat analys diet tri find whether roam wild sort captiv .', 'research also prepar analys gene tri find three metapopul nepal belong .', 'also observ anim ’ canin teeth fur look clues.reloc challeng snow leopard found urlabari town nepal ’ plain cage central zoo kathmandu .', 'photo : aryan dhimalth whole process could take month complet , summer could set kathmandu , offici conced .', '“ current temperatur kathmandu suitabl snow leopard , peak winter , ” said madhu chetri , snow leopard research ntnc .', 'could chang spring season begin northern hemisphere.th dnpwc offici said regardless find relat anim got urlabarli , anim would spent signific amount time human recoveri phase .', '“ would mean would gotten habitu human around , ” offici said.send anim back wild challeng , may lost hunt adapt skill , ad .', 'may last year , offici chitwan nation park releas two rescu rhino calv wild , limit success .', 'safeti anim , gotten use human around , compromis poacher could easili approach kill .', 'eventu , transfer enclosur eastern nepal away human intervention.veteran conservationist professor karan bahadur shah said rewild snow leopard would daunt task , anim territori .', '“ leav anim natur habitat , get kill snow leopard defend territori , ” said .', '“ best option would keep anim zoo public see . ” nepal ’ central zoo set problem .', 'facil , establish 1932 privat collect , limit space frequent run financi troubl .', 'conservationist say snow leopard would need special facil cater need . “ govern decid snow leopard need remain zoo , readi shoulder respons , ” said adhikari .', '“ set special facil anim red panda chimpanze , ” said .', '“ snow leopard well . ” advoc keep anim zoo also said nepal snow leopard rang countri public , especi young gener , also need see differ anim found countri .', '“ great educ valu , ” said shah.snow leopard expert suryawanshi neighbour india also said would challeng releas anim wild .', '“ team zoo establish exact caus behaviour [ ventur plain ] keep anim away human contact , might okay releas back , ” said .', '“ otherwis , littl hope wild .', 'better let live zoo . ” back zoo , photojournalist done take photo , turn report point smartphon anim .', 'conting senior wildlif depart offici wait line catch glimps anim .', '“ much keep away human contact , ” conservationist observ hullabaloo distanc said.thi stori first appear mongabay onlinekhabar republish creativ common licenc .']"
Posts navigation,"The National Assembly was formed to give experienced people a chance to be part of the parliament and help during the formation of important bills. In countries that follow the Westminster model of government, the upper house plays an important role. That, however, is not the case in Nepal as the country’s upper house has become a platform where individuals secure positions in the National Assembly based on their connections. As the election nears, many once again question the relevance and existence of the upper house.Things were different in the past as the initial years of the National Assembly saw experienced politicians and experts others in their field be nominated for the post. That slowly changed as the first batch completed its two-year term.“I understand why people are frustrated with the upper house. People expected experts but all we got was party cadres who lacked knowledge or experience,” says Bimala Rai Paudyal a National Assembly member. “Considering such behaviour and practices, what distinguishes the House of Representatives from the National Assembly?”A loser’s second chance Narayan Kaji Shrestha, who faced defeat in the 2017 general election from Gorkha-2, was elected as a member of the National Assembly on January 23, 2020. Elected from Gandaki Province, Shrestha currently is the Deputy Prime Minister and Home Minister of the country.Bhagwati Neupane who lost the election from Gandaki province and Bimala Ghimire who lost the election for mayorship in Bhanu Municipality also shared the same trajectory.Similarly, Mrigendra Kumar Singh Yadav and Jag Prasad Sharma were defeated in the House of Representatives elections, from Saptari-4 and Dang-3 respectively are now members of the National Assembly. Bam Dev Gautam, who lost the elections from Bardiya, secured a place in the upper house through nomination by President Bidya Devi Bhandari.Even those who did not win as ward member(s) got the opportunity to become members of the National Assembly including Sindh Bahadur Bishwakarma who was appointed on February 7, 2018. He is soon leaving his post on March 3.Despite the repeated criticisms, the political parties have not paid attention to this concern posed by political leaders and the general public. The latest proof of this is the list of candidates for the National Assembly elections scheduled on January 25. The list contains names like Krishna Prasad Sitaula, defeated in the House of Representatives elections in 2022 from Koshi Province, and Pooja Chaudhary, who lost in the provincial assembly elections 2022 from Rautahat-3 (a).Speaker Ganesh Prasad Timilsina, who led the National Assembly for the entire six years under the federal system, is also dissatisfied with the individuals who have made it to the upper house. “The allegations are something for the parties to ponder upon. The leaders should have prioritised involving intellectuals/neutrals rather than managing its members,” he says.The 59-member National Assembly elects eight representatives, equally from all seven provinces, with an additional three individuals nominated by the President. The Constitution ensures representation of women, Dalits, minorities or disabled communities, envisioning that experts, experienced individuals, and the most qualified people from various fields will become members of the National Assembly.Easy way inFile: A National Assembly meetingThere are some reasons why leaders aspire to join the upper house, and even the leadership create opportunities for them. In National Assembly elections, voters consist of local-level heads/deputy heads and provincial assembly members. Typically, individuals seeking these positions undergo a vetting process by their respective parties. As a result, aspiring members of parliament can focus less on persuading individual voters and more on gaining party support to secure their candidacy. Moreover, being a member of the National Assembly opens avenues to ministerial roles. The constitution prohibits a National Assembly member from becoming the Prime Minister, but not Deputy Prime Minister. Due to such opportunities, leaders are enticed to seek a position in the assembly.The National Assembly is currently in its fourth election cycle since the promulgation of the Consitution in 2015. Scheduled for January 25, this election aims to fill 19 seats vacated by individuals completing their six-year terms. The previous election cycles took place in 2017, involving 56 members, followed by 2019 with 18 positions, and 2020 with 19 positions.The cascading impactsFile: A National Assembly meetingAnother reason why the National Assembly is finding it difficult to justify itself is that it has become a shadow of the House of Representatives. The meeting of the National Assembly did not have one session when the House of Representatives was dissolved by then Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli twice. The demands and issues raised by the opposition parties in the House of Representatives automatically went to the National Assembly, where the parliamentarians of the ruling party put forward any proposal, they endorse it the same as in the House of Representatives.The latest example – is the main opposition UML did not allow the meeting of the House of Representatives to continue for five days from July 5, 2023, due to a statement made by Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal during his visit to India. Consequently, the meeting of the National Assembly was also paused during that period.The UML obstructed the House of Representatives for almost a month starting mid-July last year demanding a high-level inquiry committee to probe the 60-kilogram gold smuggling case and the resignation of the Home Minister. The National Assembly followed suit with leaders pushing their agendas forward.Speaker Ganesh Timilsina himself is dissatisfied that every behaviour and activity of the House of Representatives influence the National Assembly. He says despite his attempts to prevent the overshadowing, it has been unfortunate that he did not garner the goodwill of the top leaders during political disputes.Reinstating powerThe National Assembly is a permanent institution. Therefore, it can remain operational even in the absence of the House of Representatives. Under normal circumstances, Speaker Timilsina initiated a positive practice by personally participating in different committees. Nevertheless, in the absence of the House of Representatives, the National Assembly often experienced inactivity.In December 2020, the Prime Minister at that time, KP Sharma Oli, dissolved the House of Representatives. Subsequently, a session of the National Assembly was convened on January 1, 2021. Despite lasting only seven hours over four days, this session, which took place after the dissolution, failed to address crucial public issues. Even after six months, important matters remained unaddressed within the House.On May 22, 2021, the UML-led government once again dissolved the House of Representatives. The meeting of the National Assembly and committees was affected once more. However, the dissolutions were declared unconstitutional by the Supreme Court, reinstating the parliament.The Constitution says that despite the closing of the National Assembly session, thematic committee meetings can still take place. However, both the National Assembly and its committees remained inactive until the restoration of the House of Representatives.According to Khimlal Devkota, a member of the National Assembly, when the House of Representatives was dissolved twice, it seemed that the National Assembly was also in a state of dissolution.Bimala Rai Paudyal also believes that the inability to resume the upper house is a mark of weakness. “Since the government was not in a position to call, the President needed to be consulted by the chair together with the consultation committee. That was not done either,” she says.Constitutional and legal distinctionsExcept for the Constitution of Nepal (1962) and the Interim Constitution of Nepal (2007), all other constitutions in Nepal provided for a bicameral parliament with the National Assembly or the Upper House and the House of Representatives or the Lower House. The practices before 2015 were under the unitary governance system, but after the adoption of the federal democratic republican governance system, the role of the National Assembly has changed somewhat.In the preamble of the constitution prepared by the ‘Constituent Assembly, and Administrative Organ Designation Committee’ during the drafting of the constitution, it is mentioned that some different qualifications have been prescribed for being a member of the House of Representatives and the National Assembly, with the intention that qualified people can be represented in the National Assembly.Chair of the National Assembly Ganesh Prasad Timilsina restates that the members of the upper house should be assessed based on the country’s expectations with clear criteria. There is no definite definition of an expert in the constitution. It has been stated symbolically, “…It is expected that the members should have some basic skills to face the challenges and fulfil their responsibilities.”According to the constitution, the responsibility of the National Assembly is to correctly establish the rights of the local level, state, and union, and to prevent the House of Representatives from trying to enact laws contrary to the spirit of federalism. There is an explanatory comment in the constitution about the propriety of the National Assembly – “This House is expected to fulfil its role to maintain creative and mutual relations between the national government and the provinces.”In addition, there are some constitutional and legal differences regarding the National Assembly. But the MPs are demanding that it should cease. When a bill originating in the House of Representatives is passed and sent to the National Assembly, and if the latter does not decide within 60 days, it proceeds de facto.This has placed the National Assembly in a dilemma. The Chairman of the National Assembly, Timilsina, says, “Such an arrangement should also apply to the House of Representatives, or both should be equal.”Need for course correction PM Pushpa Kamal Dahal speaking in the National Assembly meeting.Some instances have turned these so-called experts into a laughing stock due to their actions. On July 5, 2023,  a discussion on the Electronic Commerce (E-Commerce) Bill 2023 was tabled in the National Assembly. However, the parliamentarians misunderstood the main point and instead discussed the matter of electricity. The MPs, who had not read the proposal, suggested that electricity consumption within Nepal should also be increased besides exporting electricity to India and Bangladesh.During the meeting, Ramesh Rijal, the Minister of Industry, Commerce and Supplies, also mentioned that India would purchase electricity during the Prime Minister’s visit. Unfortunately, the bill was unanimously approved.Timilsina considers the incident an example, that in his six-year tenure, he does not want to remember. Som Bahadur Thapa, a former secretary at the Parliament Secretariat, termed the incident ‘a joke’ in the Parliament of Nepal. “This is strong proof of the kind of MPs we have, who speak without knowing what they are talking about.” Timilsina assumed the role of the speaker/chair of the National Assembly after the establishment of the Federal Democratic Republic. He had the opportunity to establish the system and the dignity of the National Assembly. However, instead of setting a positive example, he will soon be retiring after being accused of playing tricks with the Speaker and showing interest in the work of the House of Representatives.Timilsina has repeatedly commented on the affairs of the House of Representatives. The latest instance was during a seminar on ‘Japan: Past, Present, and Future’ held in the capital on December 2, 2023, he publicly stated that the election results of the House of Representatives did not bode well.Pointing to the emergence of a new party and the victory of some independent candidates, he said, “In a democracy, you get to choose candidates, irrespective of their party affiliation. However, is the signal positive?”In August/ September 2022, Timilsina wrote a letter to the Election Commission, urging them to extend the tenure of Speaker and Deputy Speaker. Upon receiving a response stating that the Commission would not determine the tenure of the elected Parliament, Timilsina directed the Parliament Secretariat not to execute decisions made by the Management Committee after September 17, 2022.This created conflict between the Speaker of the House of Representatives and the Speaker of the National Assembly and in the crux of this dispute between the parties, the country had to bear the consequences of this conflict. Laws could not be enacted promptly, and the place once considered the domain of experts was overshadowed by the party’s interest. A study conducted by the Democracy Resource Center Nepal (DRCN) on the legislative functioning of the National Assembly has revealed that the Upper House has passed some bills that go against the spirit of federalism.The report’s concluding remarks say, “…the bills passed by the House of Representatives have not undergone significant changes or discussions in the National Assembly. The conclusion section of the study states that – “Furthermore, some bills, contradicting the spirit of federalism and addressing the interests of interest groups, have been approved by the National Assembly.”Overall, in the last six years, parties have introduced individuals who, given their presentation level, have raised questions about the National Assembly’s justification. If there are no changes in the constitution, laws, and policies concerning the upper assembly, these concerns will persist.”",['post navig'],"['nation assembl form give experienc peopl chanc part

Women in sports management can make a difference ,"Representational image Photo by Tanushree Rao on UnsplashWhile most of the nation was preparing for the festival of lights, Tihar in early November 2023, something no less exciting was fuelling our sparks from oceans away. A queer art festival was happening for the seventeenth year and we had a chance to attend it as delegates. Our delegation was made possible through the collaboration between the Outburst Arts, an art organisation based in Northern Ireland, UK and the British Council, Nepal.There is a clear distinction between cities in terms of their flourishing arts scenes, and this became apparent during a visit to Belfast, Northern Ireland, specifically for the Outburst Queer Arts Festival held in the charming city centre. The organisation of such a festival requires months of careful preparation and planning.The queer art festival started as short events lasting a few days. Now, after 17 years, it has grown into a ten-day festival with panel discussions, theatre performances, and exhibitions. Program guides were available at venues, partner hotels, local libraries, and shops. Many delegates, including us, came from outside Northern Ireland to attend.During the queer art festival, we had the opportunity to connect with art curators, publishers, artists, and representatives from other British Council departments around the world (Lithuania, France, South Africa, Turkey, Greece, Jordan, England, and Argentina to name a few.) Each event that we attended gave us a different insight into what the arts can do and how it can facilitate connections. We gained insights from queer publishers and art curators on the challenges they face in their own countries due to resources and sometimes from bureaucracy in systems. We also got to see the way people can thrive when given a platform to showcase their works, such as an art exhibition in which the artist reimagined intimacy for queer people.On the other hand, Nepal struggles by and large at times for queer visibility. There are no explicit spaces for SOGIESC (Sexual Orientation, Gender Identity and Expressions and Sex Characteristics) artists to showcase their works nor openly come together as a community, it all exists in pocket spaces. In the same way, something that struck us was the presence of older queer artists at the festival. It was not just for one particular event during the queer art festival. We noticed an active participation and involvement of older queer people throughout the festival there. It was fascinating to see queer artists in their 40s and 50s share their transformative and inspiring work. Whereas, back home, the queer folks at the forefront of queer art, advocacy and activism are mostly Gen-Zs and millennials. We have very few queer elders that we can count on our fingers who are diligently working for Nepali queer folks. Even among them, some still hold onto archaic notions and refuse to evolve and embrace changes. So, there’s that.From dream to realityDuring the queer art festival, we had the opportunity to connect with art curators, publishers and artists. Photo by Raphael Renter | @raphi_rawr on UnsplashBefore being selected as delegates, both of us joined online meetings with British Council Nepal and the Outburst representatives facilitated through Kaalo 101 (an art space in Patan), along with interested queer artists from Nepal. We had a total of three meetings where we discussed the possibilities and challenges of doing a queer art festival in Nepal. The discourse also entailed us sharing a presentation about the updates of the queer art scene in Nepal in the last five years. The updates included memorable leaps taken in queer arts from music to literature and fashion and more by artists from diverse walks of life. Days after the third meeting, the British Council extended invitations to us to attend the Outburst Queer Arts Festival.Our delegation is just one example of the transcontinental collaboration because it was something that happened for the first time and involved us. But, Outburst Arts and the British Council have been practising cross-continental collaboration for years. Even in this year’s festival, we witnessed a lot of artists from different continents work together in exhibitions, lectures, panel discussions, magazines and so on. The amalgamation introduced us to brilliant thought-provoking work that defies gender and sociopolitical norms. The power of transcontinental collaboration was beyond beautiful.Imagining queer arts in NepalPhoto by Nikolas Gannon on UnsplashThe queer art scene in Nepal is an emerging one. While a full-fledged festival may not be possible now, something small yet significant is achievable. Time and again, different organisations have been running large art exhibitions/tours for weeks and months. However, in the microcosm that is Nepal, especially Kathmandu, the capital is no stranger to art-oriented programs. What it has been unfamiliar with precisely is queer art. And the unfamiliarity is not something induced by the lack of queer artists and their art. Sadly, it is because of inadequate platforms, space and resources to pursue queer arts.Despite this, through the years there have been events and literature that have emerged centring on queer identity, but it has not come without its challenges. On collections of stories, “Pride Climbing Higher” and “Songs of Revolution” showcase stories from Nepalis across Nepal. There are not many stories reflecting the Nepali queer experiences otherwise. June Pride Parade by Queer Youth Group has gained momentum as well in the past few years since its conception, from a small gathering to now a large parade with performances from community members. The same can be said about Blue Diamond Society’s (BDS) Rainbow Visibility Pride events in August during the festival of Saa-Paru (Gai Jatra) which has been running for well over a decade; in recent years they have included flash mobs and interaction programmes as well in lead up to their parade. Individuals within the community have also organised their queer gatherings with friends, thus coming back to the cosmos of pocket spaces in celebrating queerness.While artists like us are creative with what we want to put out, we still need organisations like the British Council to foster spaces and connections to enable us to do that. Then and again, artists have come together and collaborated on queer-centric projects. But, we need funding and resources to achieve bigger-scale projects that unite more artists and transcend borders.Both of us advocate for queer rights and are involved in programs and activities that push the narrative further, extend the visibility of the community and normalise conversations surrounding queerness. Among other things, we are also the founders of Queering The Bond, a networking collective for Nepali queer folks and Shuby is also the founder of Queer Honky-Tonk, a platform to promote queer performances and networking with events such as a drag show or open mic every few months. However, both of us, individually or collaboratively can only do so much. The challenges of living in a capitalistic world oftentimes outweigh the passion we have for the queer art scene in Nepal. And this is where we expect the government and organisations to step up with policies, platforms and programs to provide spaces, opportunities and resources for queer artists. Here, the British Council joined hands with Outburst Arts, which paved the way for our delegation. We would not have known about the marvellous queer art festival at the other end of the world otherwise.Besides the limitations brought by insufficient spaces and social unawareness, the centralised capital does hinder queer artists from outside the city to connect, create and collaborate. Art already is centralised and elitist. On top of that, the concentrated Kathmandu Valley is of no help when it comes to making art accessible beyond its borders.Furthermore, there is also the expectation from basically everyone to have the perfect festival that caters to all people’s needs and wants. While the festival, if it should happen, is bound to be done with the right intentions, there is a lot of pressure for the first-time event itself. The festival will be inclusive and diverse. But, realistically speaking, it would be a struggle to make it relevant to each queer person from east to west.Speaking of struggles, a visceral feeling of uneasiness swarmed over me with each step I took while exiting the airport after the flight back home. I, Birat, personally felt that I could not be as free or unrestrained in Nepal as I was during my time in Belfast. No wonder a lot of the queer people we know opt for abroad.Seventeen years ago, when the Outburst Queer Arts Festival first began, it certainly was not as celebrated or large as it is now. What we are trying to convey here is that we do not have to start big. We can aim for something small yet promising. While there might be expectations to check all the boxes, it is crucial to be mindful of our capacity as well. But, we can be capacitated and this is where you – people in power, art enthusiasts, grant and resource allocators and media come in. It is time we all believe in Nepali queer art and create space for it to not only survive but thrive. It is imperative to understand that formulating our imagination into reality can only be possible through unwavering collaboration.",['women sport manag make differ'],"['represent imag photo tanushre rao unsplashwhil nation prepar festiv light , tihar earli novemb 2023 , someth less excit fuell spark ocean away .', 'queer art festiv happen seventeenth year chanc attend deleg .', 'deleg made possibl collabor outburst art , art organis base northern ireland , uk british council , nepal.ther clear distinct citi term flourish art scene , becam appar visit belfast , northern ireland , specif outburst queer art festiv held charm citi centr .', 'organis festiv requir month care prepar planning.th queer art festiv start short event last day .', ', 17 year , grown ten-day festiv panel discuss , theatr perform , exhibit .', 'program guid avail venu , partner hotel , local librari , shop .', 'mani deleg , includ us , came outsid northern ireland attend.dur queer art festiv , opportun connect art curat , publish , artist , repres british council depart around world ( lithuania , franc , south africa , turkey , greec , jordan , england , argentina name . )', 'event attend gave us differ insight art facilit connect .', 'gain insight queer publish art curat challeng face countri due resourc sometim bureaucraci system .', 'also got see way peopl thrive given platform showcas work , art exhibit artist reimagin intimaci queer people.on hand , nepal struggl larg time queer visibl .', 'explicit space sogiesc ( sexual orient , gender ident express sex characterist ) artist showcas work openli come togeth commun , exist pocket space .', 'way , someth struck us presenc older queer artist festiv .', 'one particular event queer art festiv .', 'notic activ particip involv older queer peopl throughout festiv .', 'fascin see queer artist 40 50 share transform inspir work .', 'wherea , back home , queer folk forefront queer art , advocaci activ mostli gen-z millenni .', 'queer elder count finger dilig work nepali queer folk .', 'even among , still hold onto archaic notion refus evolv embrac chang .', ', ’ that.from dream realitydur queer art festiv , opportun connect art curat , publish artist .', 'photo raphael renter | @ raphi_rawr unsplashbefor select deleg , us join onlin meet british council nepal outburst repres facilit kaalo 101 ( art space patan ) , along interest queer artist nepal .', 'total three meet discuss possibl challeng queer art festiv nepal .', 'discours also entail us share present updat queer art scene nepal last five year .', 'updat includ memor leap taken queer art music literatur fashion artist divers walk life .', 'day third meet , british council extend invit us attend outburst queer art festival.our deleg one exampl transcontinent collabor someth happen first time involv us .', ', outburst art british council practis cross-continent collabor year .', 'even year ’ festiv , wit lot artist differ contin work togeth exhibit , lectur , panel discuss , magazin .', 'amalgam introduc us brilliant thought-provok work defi gender sociopolit norm .', 'power transcontinent collabor beyond beautiful.imagin queer art nepalphoto nikola gannon unsplashth queer art scene nepal emerg one .', 'full-fledg festiv may possibl , someth small yet signific achiev .', 'time , differ organis run larg art exhibitions/tour week month .', 'howev , microcosm nepal , especi kathmandu , capit stranger art-ori program .', 'unfamiliar precis queer art .', 'unfamiliar someth induc lack queer artist art .', 'sadli , inadequ platform , space resourc pursu queer arts.despit , year event literatur emerg centr queer ident , come without challeng .', 'collect stori , “ pride climb higher ” “ song revolut ” showcas stori nepali across nepal .', 'mani stori reflect nepali queer experi otherwis .', 'june pride parad queer youth group gain momentum well past year sinc concept , small gather larg parad perform commun member .', 'said blue diamond societi ’ ( bd ) rainbow visibl pride event august festiv saa-paru ( gai jatra ) run well decad ;

Priyam Pradhan explores the essence of money and life in ‘Mani’ ,"The month of January saw major road accidents in different parts of the country, including Lamhi in Dang, Dhorpatan in Baglung, and Chandragiri in Kathmandu. Road accidents have been common throughout the country with Nepal Police data suggesting over 2,500 people dying in them annually. Despite this, the Ministry of Finance has shown reluctance to introduce the proposed Road Safety Bill to reduce traffic accidents, fatalities, and serious injuries, and enhance road safety. Instead, the Finance Ministry has asked the Ministry of Physical Infrastructure and Transport to include the proposed bill in the Public Roads Act. Along with that, the government’s initiative to pass dedicated laws on road safety and set up a mechanism, including the empowered National Road Safety Council (NRSC), to decrease accidents, has come to a halt.Keshav Kumar Sharma, secretary of the Ministry of Physical Infrastructure and Transport, says they asked for a dedicated road safety law that comprehensively addresses institutional arrangements was the need of the hour. This includes ensuring safety in road construction, promoting public awareness, providing training and communication facilities, implementing rescue mechanisms, and arranging rehabilitation for families affected by road accidents. However, the Ministry of Finance believes a separate law is unnecessary due to concerns about potential increased financial burden.Hourly needOfficials from the Ministry of Physical Infrastructure allege that the Ministry of Finance is approaching sensitive matters, such as passenger safety, solely from an economic standpoint. They say that concerns related to road, vehicle, and passenger safety are being overshadowed, and there are indications that this approach will continue. “The government is avoiding addressing the sensitive issue of road accidents and the associated human and material costs, fearing an increase in expenses. This contradicts the government’s commitment and policy to reduce traffic accidents in the future,” says an official from the Ministry of Physical Infrastructure on the condition of anonymity.According to the Ministry of Physical Infrastructure, the existing laws lack the vision and purpose necessary for developing a sustainable, safe, risk-free, and reliable transportation operation and security system. Therefore, the Ministry of Physical Infrastructure officials argue that a distinct law is essential to decrease road accidents and ensure the safety of pedestrians, including passenger transport workers and roadside residents, as well as pets, wild animals, and birds. “The Road Safety Act is the need of the hour as it will help us during post-accident rescue, treatment management, rehabilitation, and legal representation,” says the official.Currently, there are gaps in enforcing road rules, monitoring vehicle capacities, ensuring road structure safety, managing traffic signs, and organizing road safety facilities. The implementation of the Road Safety Act is seen as crucial to address these issues.However, there has not been a facilitative environment for providing education and raising awareness about road traffic safety, safety mechanisms, and coordinating among organisations related to road transport. The aspect of training drivers with skills and knowledge, as well as monitoring road safety on the roads, is also lacking. This is why experts have been suggesting introducing a separate road safety law to address these aspects.The Finance Ministry, however, says that road safety should not be downplayed by ignoring human sensibilities related to road safety and citing economic reasons. Officials from the Ministry of Physical Infrastructure argue that incorporating safety considerations in the Road Act does not automatically result in a decrease in accidents or the integration of post-accident rescue, relief, and rehabilitation efforts.“The existing laws do not address road safety anywhere. Due to its lack of clarity and inadequacy, it has not been implemented with due diligence. For instance, provisions such as those for vehicle inspectors outlined in the Transport Act have not been acted upon by the government,” says an official from the Transport Ministry.Policies and commitments, but no lawsThe Motor Vehicles and Transport Management Act (1993) includes several provisions related to vehicle registration, road permits, driver’s licenses, traffic management, insurance, and penalties. The Public Roads Act (1974) primarily focuses on road management. However, there is no provision in the Act regarding the National Road Safety Council.In this situation, Nepal has developed a 10-year road safety action plan but is yet to enact corresponding legislation. Unfortunately, government agencies and mechanisms are not obligated to follow the action plan, as it lacks legal guidance.Now, the Transport Ministry holds the view that if safety considerations are explicitly addressed in the Public Roads Act, the outcome will not differ from what the Finance Ministry has said. Given the Public Roads Act’s close association with the Department of Road, the ministry thinks greater emphasis will be placed on road construction. However, they argue that incorporating the road safety aspect into the Act would not be effective.Secretary Sharma of the Transport Ministry is tasked with ensuring road safety, overseeing physical infrastructure and transport, and coordinating efforts across education, health, home, law, federal affairs, and general administration ministries. This responsibility extends to provincial ministries, local levels, as well as various agencies, organisations, security agencies, non-governmental organisations, and related entities, each with their specific roles.“As all the agencies need to be allocated responsibilities for various aspects of road safety, we have requested them to collaborate in formulating a distinct law. This should encompass the reduction of all types of accidents,” said Sharma.The ministry believes that a dedicated law addressing road safety is crucial to mitigate severe road accidents in Nepal and to uphold the commitments made by the country on the international stage.Nepal has committed to implementing the Stockholm Declaration through the Global Road Traffic Safety Conference in 2020, as per the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. Nepal, which has incorporated sustainable development goals into its national development plan, has not yet commenced work aligned with these objectives.Nevertheless, Nepal’s neighbouring countries are already addressing road safety through legal frameworks. Various states in India have enacted road safety laws, and the effectiveness of these laws is contributing to a 50 per cent reduction in road accidents.In 1999, Bhutan also introduced a unified road safety and transport act. Pakistan, on the other hand, issued the National Highway Safety Ordinance-2000 to ensure road safety, distinct from its National Highway Authority Act (1991). Britain, Australia, America, New Zealand, and other countries have established separate road safety laws as well.Road safety neglectedIn Nepal, road safety has been consistently neglected due to the absence of dedicated legislation. Road safety expert Keshav Adhikari says that the government primarily focused on road construction, overlooks crucial aspects such as road safety and reinforcement. Consequently, roads are transforming into perilous pathways for both vehicles and passengers.“There is a lack of interest in formulating policies and laws aimed at mitigating financial losses resulting from accidents,” says Adhikari.He further points out that safety is not a governmental priority, as expanding the road network is perceived to yield more political benefits than implementing additional structures to enhance road safety.“When I worked as an expert in the Transport Ministry for over a year, I realised that promoting road safety is not a government priority,” he says. “Annually, more people die due to road accidents than those who die in natural disasters, but the government has not given it much attention.”Even though the prime minister, ministers, and MPs keep asserting that roads have been constructed, no one seems to be addressing the critical issues of road safety and quality.Saroj Sitaula, General Secretary of the Federation of Nepalese National Transport Entrepreneurs (FNNTE), says that the government must be attentive as accidents are on the rise due to various technical and human factors, including road infrastructure. “Many accidents can be mitigated by improving road conditions, installing barriers on the sides, putting up informational boards, and ensuring scientific and practical road markings,” he says. “We need to formulate a plan and progress accordingly.”Sitaula argues that the government should establish policies to create mechanisms for emergency rescue, treatment, and rehabilitation after an accident occurs. He emphasises the importance of enhancing road infrastructure, conducting a scientific examination of the technical condition of vehicles, and ensuring compliance with the law by drivers, passengers, and regulators. He says that blaming drivers and transport entrepreneurs for accidents is inadequate, and the government must fulfil its responsibilities.Roads are unsafeNepal currently boasts a road network spanning approximately 100,000 km, with the majority consisting of dirt and gravel roads. Among the more than 22,000 kilometres of national and subsidiary highways, numerous sections remain unpaved.Despite the government’s substantial investment in road construction and expansion, minimal efforts are allocated to ensuring road safety. Recently, all three levels of government have accelerated the widening of roads, incorporating asphalt and slopes. However, it appears that issues concerning road quality and safety are escalating at a faster pace. Roads that have been neglected in the guise of maintenance have become a nightmare for the public.Infrastructure expert Suryaraj Acharya notes that these problems arise due to the tendency to construct roads only after they have sustained damage, without considering potential issues during the initial construction phase.",['priyam pradhan explor essenc money life ‘ mani ’'],"['month

National Assembly election taking place today ,"Realme 12 Pro+ 5G. Photo: Realme IndiaRealme has launched its popular mid-range number series smartphone, the Realme 12 Pro series. The series includes the Realme 12 Pro 5G and the Realme 12 Pro+ 5G which are the successors of the Realme 11 Pro+ 5G and Realme 11 Pro 5G respectively. The Realme 11 series was widely appreciated for its design and performance at the price range. The 12 series has stepped up the game with an even better design. Realme has not only changed the design but has also upgraded the performance and the camera to compete in the mid-range price market. Realme recently has been focusing a lot on the design aspect and the price range performance. The 12 Pro+ has some major differences from last year’s 11 Pro+ which include design, IP rating, chipset, camera and charging. Let us see what the luxuriously designed smartphone delivers in terms of specs.Specifications of Realme 12 Pro+ 5GDimensionsLength: 161.47mmWidth: 74.02mmDepth: 8.75mmWeight196 gramsDisplay typeAMOLEDDisplay size6.7-inchResolution2,412 x 1,080 (FHD+)Refresh rateUp to 120HzIP ratingIP65 dust and water resistance Glass Protection0.55mm Double-Reinforced GlassChipsetSnapdragon 7s Gen 2 (4nm)CPUOcta-core (4×2.40 GHz Cortex-A78 & 4×1.95 GHz Cortex-A55)GPUAdreno 710OSRealme UI 5.0 based on Android 14RAM8GB | 12GBStorage128GB | 256GBRear camera 50MP Sony IMX890 main camera8MP ultra-wide camera64MP periscope portrait cameraSelfie camera32MP Wi-Fi802.11 a/b/g/n/ac/ax（Wi-Fi 6）Bluetooth5.2NetworkLTE | 5GSIMDual Nano SIMAudioDual SpeakersSupports Dolby AtmosDual-mic Noise CancellationHi-Res Audio CertificationSensorsGeomagnetic sensor, Proximity sensor, Light sensor, Acceleration sensor, Gyroscope, In-display fingerprint sensorBattery5,000mAh (typ)Charging67W SUPERVOOC wired fast chargingPorts and Buttons2 Nano SIM Card SlotsType-C PortPower ButtonVolume ButtonsColoursSubmarine BlueNavigator BeigeExplorer RedPrice (expected)Rs 50,000 (8/128GB)Rs 54,000 (8/256GB)Rs 60,000 (12/256GB)Design and DisplayThe Realme 12 Pro+ and the Realme 12 Pro share the same design and dimensions. The design is fascinating. Realme patterned up with Luxury Swiss Watch designer Ollivier Savéo to craftfully design the smartphone. All the colour options have a vegan leather back. Since the phone is designed by a luxury watch designer, it comes with a big round camera module housing the triple camera setup. There is a golden 3D Jubilee Bracelet which gives the texture of a luxury watch strap. A golden patterned line runs through the middle and around the camera module for an even better look.Realme 12 Pro+ 5G designer Ollivier Savéo.

On the front, the 12 Pro+ 5G has a curved screen with a centred hole-punch cutout which houses the selfie camera. The bezels are minimal with the sides being curved almost zero while the top and the chin have a slight ear-like bezel.

Photo: Realme IndiaPerformance and StorageThe performance has also been stepped up with the change from MediaTek Chipset in the 11 Pro series to Snapdragon chipsets in the 12 Pro series. The Realme 12 Pro+ 5G is powered by the Snapdragon 7s Gen 2 chipset built on a 4nm processor. It has an octa-core CPU, which includes Cortex-A78 and Cortex-A55 cores for seamless multitasking and responsiveness. The Adreno 710 GPU handles the graphics for gaming and multimedia. Photo: Realme IndiaIt runs on the Realme UI 5.0 based on Android 14. The overall software experience is good but Realme gets back to the cost-cutting techniques in the software part with a bunch load of pre-installed hot apps and hot games. It also has a 3D VC liquid cooling system which spans 3394mm² and covers the main heat sources of the motherboard giving a boost in heat dissipation efficiency.Photo: Realme IndiaThe Realme 12 Pro+ 5G is available in two RAM options which include 8GB and 12GB. The 8GB RAM is paired with 128GB and 256GB storage options while the 12GB RAM is paired with 256GB of storage. It also has a Dynamic RAM feature which helps to increase the RAM size up to 24GB using the internal storage.Photo: Realme IndiaCameraThe camera on the Realme 12 Pro+ 5G is also interesting. Here, Realme has partnered up with Chilean cinematographer Claudio Miranda. He has worked in films such as Life of Pi, Top Gun: Maverick, The Curious Case of Benjamin Button and Tron: Legacy. He has also won an Academy Award for Best Cinematography for his role in Life of Pi in 2013. Claudio Miranda has worked with Realme for fine-tuning images. There are also three film filters made in collaboration with Claudio Miranda with unique colour grading matched with a 2.39:1 aspect ratio and cinematic-level bokeh adjustment. The filters are Journey, Maverick and Memory. Photo: Realme IndiaThe Realme 12 Pro+ 5G has a triple camera setup at the rear.

Santoshi Shrestha wins gold on marathon debut ,"Ram Bujhaun Yadav with his land ownership certificate stands near a border pillar which he says was erroneously placed on his land. In October 2023, when 51-year-old Ram Bujhaun Yadav of Musaharnia Rural Municipality-5, Mukhiyapatti, Dhanusha, was at a relative’s house, someone told him that two Indian Sashastra Seema Bal (SSB) personnel were looking for him.Anxious, he rushed home wondering why they were looking for him.“They asked me if the paddy field in the no man’s land was mine. I told them yes and they asked me to cut down the paddy immediately,” he said.The paddy was not ripe and Yadav asked them for some time. However, the SSB personnel told him he had to cut down his paddy immediately.Ram Bujhaun and his wife Tetari Devi each own a 677-square-metre plot of land. As Nepal and India reevaluated the border, Ram Bujhan’s land was been deemed to be near the no man’s land as it now has two demarcation pillars.Frustrated, Ram Bujhaun cut the paddy before it was due to be harvested. Now, he has been asked to not plant anything on the land as it falls in the no man’s land.“Our border police don’t say a word. I can’t fight the SSB on my own,” says Ram Bujhaun adding he had decided not to plan anything on the land anymore.Woes of the farmersMany farmers in southern Nepal say their land has now been placed in India after the recent demarcation. When the Jamuna River, which flows through the no man’s land between Nepal and India, changed its course some two decades ago, some border pillars went missing. Locals say these pillars have now been placed encroaching on Nepali land.In 2018, with the then Chief District Officer of Dhanusha, Pradeep Raj Kandel, and an official from Madhubani district, Bihar, India, a team that included border security forces from both countries, the Armed Police Force of Nepal, and SSB of India began placing border pillars after land measurement by technicians.Locals have raised concerns, stating that border pillars have been positioned, encroaching approximately 50 to 100 meters of land into Nepal compared to the previous position. Many like Ram Bujhaun are unaware of when these border pillars were placed.“I did not know that pillar was placed here. After I found out when I asked the village leaders, many said they were placing the border pillars as they pleased,” said Ram Bujhaun.He was told to carry on planting paddy and that it would not matter as these issues had happened in the past. “They encroached on my land and have asked me not to plant anything. This is gross injustice,” he says.Ram Bujhaun’s family owns a total of 4,000 square metres of land, with 2,000 square metres belonging to him and the remaining 2,000 square metres to his brother Bechan. However, 1,000 square metres of his land is now located on the Indian side after the demarcation. Despite this, he has been farming on the land and continues to pay taxes to the Department of Land Management and Archive in Nepal.“They have marked my land to be on the Indian side and placed border pillars on it. I’ve been farming till now but I don’t know when they will ask me to stop,” he says.Ignorance of the governmentThe Madhesh province in southern NepalThe former ward chair of Mukhiyapatti Musharniya Rural Municipality-5, Ram Naresh Yadav, said that over time, India has encroached on numerous Nepali lands in various locations in the Madhesh Province. This, he says, happened due to the Nepali administration’s ignorance and weak stature.“They (Nepali administration) were careless and that meant the Indian side placed these border pillars by encroaching on Nepali land,” says Ram Naresh.He said that over 40 farmers from wards 1, 5, and 6 have land ranging from 300 to 1,600 square metres on the Indian side. “These farmers have land ownership certificates, but they cannot farm as the SSB says the land is in India and not Nepal,” said Ram Naresh.In 1996, land ownership certificates were distributed after surveying the land in the border area. Local Dharmendra Kumar Yadav said that since then, the locals have been paying their land tax regularly. In 2018, when the pillar was being placed, the locals protested when they saw their land was being encroached on. However, since the demarcation had been agreed upon by high-ranking government officials of Nepal and India, the farmer’s voices went unheard.“We tried to stop when the border pillars were being placed on our land. But the administrators from both sides forcibly put it there without even trying to hold a discussion,” said Harish Chandra Yadav. The Chief District Officer of Dhanusha, Chakrapani Pandey, says that the border pillars were placed by the technical team after the measurements and with the agreement of the high-ranking officials of the two countries.“The fields and houses that are built in no man’s land have recently been cleared. No one can do anything in this particular area,” said Pandey. “We understand the people’s concern but we cannot do anything about it now.”",['santoshi shrestha win gold marathon debut'],"['ram bujhaun yadav land ownership certif stand near border pillar say erron place land .', 'octob 2023 , 51-year-old ram bujhaun yadav musaharnia rural municipality-5 , mukhiyapatti , dhanusha , rel ’ hous , someon told two indian sashastra seema bal ( ssb ) personnel look him.anxi , rush home wonder look him . “ ask paddi field man ’ land mine .', 'told ye ask cut paddi immedi , ” said.th paddi ripe yadav ask time .', 'howev , ssb personnel told cut paddi immediately.ram bujhaun wife tetari devi 677-square-metr plot land .', 'nepal india reevalu border , ram bujhan ’ land deem near man ’ land two demarc pillars.frustr , ram bujhaun cut paddi due harvest .', ', ask plant anyth land fall man ’ land . “ border polic ’ say word .', '’ fight ssb , ” say ram bujhaun ad decid plan anyth land anymore.wo farmersmani farmer southern nepal say land place india recent demarc .', 'jamuna river , flow man ’ land nepal india , chang cours two decad ago , border pillar went miss .', 'local say pillar place encroach nepali land.in 2018 , chief district offic dhanusha , pradeep raj kandel , offici madhubani district , bihar , india , team includ border secur forc countri , arm polic forc nepal , ssb india began place border pillar land measur technicians.loc rais concern , state border pillar posit , encroach approxim 50 100 meter land nepal compar previou posit .', 'mani like ram bujhaun unawar border pillar place . “ know pillar place .', 'found ask villag leader , mani said place border pillar pleas , ” said ram bujhaun.h told carri plant paddi would matter issu happen past .', '“ encroach land ask plant anyth .', 'gross injustic , ” says.ram bujhaun ’ famili own total 4,000 squar metr land , 2,000 squar metr belong remain 2,000 squar metr brother bechan .', 'howev , 1,000 squar metr land locat indian side demarc .', 'despit , farm land continu pay tax depart land manag archiv nepal . “ mark land indian side place border pillar .', '’ farm till ’ know ask stop , ” says.ignor governmentth madhesh provinc southern nepalth former ward chair mukhiyapatti musharniya rural municipality-5 , ram naresh yadav , said time , india encroach numer nepali land variou locat madhesh provinc .', ', say , happen due nepali administr ’ ignor weak statur . “ ( nepali administr ) careless meant indian side place border pillar encroach nepali land , ” say ram naresh.h said 40 farmer ward 1 , 5 , 6 land rang 300 1,600 squar metr indian side .', '“ farmer land ownership certif , farm ssb say land india nepal , ” said ram naresh.in 1996 , land ownership certif distribut survey land border area .', 'local dharmendra kumar yadav said sinc , local pay land tax regularli .', '2018 , pillar place , local protest saw land encroach .', 'howev , sinc demarc agre upon high-rank govern offici nepal india , farmer ’ voic went unheard . “ tri stop border pillar place land .', 'administr side forcibl put without even tri hold discuss , ” said harish chandra yadav .', 'chief district offic dhanusha , chakrapani pandey , say border pillar place technic team measur agreement high-rank offici two countri . “ field hous built man ’ land recent clear .', 'one anyth particular area , ” said pandey .', '“ understand peopl ’ concern anyth . ”']"
Erroneous border pillar placement plagues Nepali farmers in Madhesh ,"Photo by pippen on UnsplashLife is filled with surprises and unexpected events and it can change at any moment. The only thing certain in life is the uncertainty. Change is a natural and inevitable part of our lives, and it may be positive as well as negative.Even though it is not guaranteed that we will wake up in the morning, we set the alarm every night with the hope that we will wake up in the morning. We do not know what each day is going to bring us, but we may have varieties, adventures, and endless opportunities.The push to exploreThe uncertainty sometimes forces us to explore those aspects of life, we never knew existed or needed. It also tests the mental strength of people and how they deal with it. The uncertainty has taught me to be grateful, as we never know what life throws at us.In life, everything does not go according to our plans, and if we do not embrace the change we will face huge trouble. The Covid-19 pandemic is the best example of uncertainty, we were constantly fearing death and it was uncertain that we would see the sunrise the next day.It is not certain that every decision in life will be correct, but if you fear not trying at all, you miss endless opportunities for learning and growing. When our decisions or outcomes are on the negative side, we get depressed and we might tend to think about committing suicide, but we forget that if we have life we have endless opportunities. Most of us plan for our careers, our love life, etc. and when those plans do not work out we start getting uncomfortable. But if we can deal with today, we can surely deal with tomorrow. We need to cherish little moments in our lives and know that nothing is permanent not even the failures and setbacks.We come here with nothing and leave with nothing. So why should we hold the egos and grudges against each other? Instead of making our life meaningful and enjoying the journey of life, we get into puzzles of accumulating wealth and we go against our own loved ones for it. Change is certainPhoto by Kathyryn Tripp on UnsplashNothing is permanent in life, everything can change in fractions of seconds. In today’s society, everyone is so busy, that we people have so less time for our loved ones. What I have learned over the years, is to find time in our busy schedule for our family because we never know when it will be our last day together with them. Yes! Death is a natural process, so if you have to die someday, why should you die with grudges in your heart? But instead of worrying about the inevitable, focusing on the things you can control will bring a lot of happiness in life.Uncertainty is not only a negative thing; it also brings a lot of opportunity because you dare to change. The life-changing experience will not come knocking down your door, you need to expose yourself. We learn by doing and experimenting, even though we might fail. But that is not the end of the world. I still remember hesitating while applying for the role of leadership, at my school level as it was not certain that I would be chosen.Even after being selected, I was uncertain about whether I could fulfil my responsibilities or not. But that uncertainty helped me grow out of my comfort zone and give my best input. If I had not applied for that role just because I was uncertain of the outcome, I would miss the biggest learning opportunity in my school life. So, do not let the uncertainty or the unknown ever stop you from trying and no matter how much we try, to plan life always finds a way to surprise us. It is important to stay grounded when we have everything we wish for because life can take such a turn that we had never expected in our wildest dreams. Similarly, nothing is permanent in life, the financial hardships, the grades, the breakups, etc. But the most important thing is not to lose hope during those difficult times.According to the data provided by Nepal police, around 6,830 people took their lives in the fiscal year 2022/23. There is nothing in life that cannot be resolved although it may take time, committing suicide should not be an option. It’s important to share feelings among family members or loved ones because together as a family any problem can be overcome.Embrace the unknown and focus on enhancing your life, instead of worrying about what will happen next.

(Photo by Ishara S. KODIKARA / AFP)Kathmandu, September 5India have knocked Nepal out of the Asia Cup in a rain-affected match in Pallekele on Monday.Asking Nepal to bat first, India did not take advantage of the chances that came their way dropping three catches in the first five overs. Taking advantage of that, Nepali openers, Kushal Bhurtel and Aasif Sheikh played shots riding their luck at times as they put up a 65-run opening stand.The rest of the batters, however, could not take advantage of the start. Bhim Sharki, Rohit Paudel and Kushal Malla all threw their wicket away by playing poor shots. Gulshan Jha soon followed them to the pavilion as Nepal had no answer for the spin bowling of Ravindra Jadeja and Kuldeep Yadav.When Sheikh got out for 58 in the 30th over, it looked like Nepal would be bowled out for less than 200. However, a valiant innings from Dipendra Singh Airee and Sompal Kami took the score past 200 and Nepal were bowled out for 230, a major improvement from their last game against Pakistan in Multan.In reply, India were tested in the first over when Karan KC challenged Rohit Sharma. However, the team were soon shown how far behind they are by Sharma and Shubman Gill who hit the ballers all over the park. The game was shorted due to rain with India needing 145 to win in 23 overs.That did not affect the Indian batters as they reached their with ease with 17 balls to spare.With this loss, Nepal’s first participation in the Asia Cup has been a bittersweet one. Even though former international players have heaped praise, the players will leave Sri Lanka with a feeling of what if as they push on to play with the big boys again.","['regen brake ev : advantag , disadvantag common misconcept']","['india ’ ravindra jadeja celebr teammat take wicket nepal ’ kushal malla asia cup match india nepal pallekel intern cricket stadium kandi septemb 4 , 2023 .', '( photo ishara s. kodikara / afp ) kathmandu , septemb 5india knock nepal asia cup rain-affect match pallekel monday.ask nepal bat first , india take advantag chanc came way drop three catch first five over .', 'take advantag , nepali open , kushal bhurtel aasif sheikh play shot ride luck time put 65-run open stand.th rest batter , howev , could take advantag start .', 'bhim sharki , rohit paudel kushal malla threw wicket away play poor shot .', 'gulshan jha soon follow pavilion nepal answer spin bowl ravindra jadeja kuldeep yadav.when sheikh got 58 30th , look like nepal would bowl less 200 .', 'howev , valiant inning dipendra singh aire sompal kami took score past 200 nepal bowl 230 , major improv last game pakistan multan.in repli , india test first karan kc challeng rohit sharma .', 'howev , team soon shown far behind sharma shubman gill hit baller park .', 'game short due rain india need 145 win 23 overs.that affect indian batter reach eas 17 ball spare.with loss , nepal ’ first particip asia cup bittersweet one .', 'even though former intern player heap prais , player leav sri lanka feel push play big boy .']"

Part of Nepal’s team that took part in the 2019 Asian Games, she knows how tough the opponents are going to be.“This is only the third time we are taking part in the 3×3 basketball competition in Asian Games. We want to play well and win at least one game this year,” Khadka said.Gearing up for Asian Games National women’s team practising for Asian Games, slated for September Shreya Khadka and the members of the national women’s team have been training for the past three months. They are taking part in at least 10 practice sessions a week. As the date for the tournament nears, the team feels confident as they have seen their performance get better over time.Khadka knowns that they will need more than that to win games at the Asian Games.“We did not win a single game in 2019 but I realised what it takes to win. We were not physical enough and this time have worked on it,” she said. “Another important takeaway from the tournament was that height does not matter.”Although she acknowledges the significant role that height plays in basketball, she holds the belief that the assumption that tall players are inherently skilled is false.“It’s all about skills and strength and we are working on it,” she said.To get stronger and compete physically with the rest of Asia, the team has been powerlifting and playing against men.“We’ve also been eating right,” Khadka said.Lingering challengesShreya Khadka will be accompanied by Garisha Silwal, Mina Gurung and Rinchen Moktan in the national team. The team is showing an unwavering commitment to the tournament. However, the team says they are facing various challenges and one of those is the lack of consistent and effective training sessions What has not helped the team is they do not have a dedicated practice facility and are instead making use of rented spaces at two locations: Surya Sports Centre in Dhumbarahi and Mamba Sports Center in Buddhanagar. The disadvantage of relying on rented venues is that their practice schedules are dependent on court availability, and furthermore, these courts lack the necessary training equipment and resources.Moreover, the format of a 3×3 basketball tournament is also comparatively different from a full-court basketball tournament. That is another challenge for Shreya Khadka and her team. In contrast to a conventional basketball game, the team’s coach will not be present next to them. Instead, the coach is required to occupy a seat in the audience and is prohibited from providing any form of verbal or symbolic instructions.This is where Khadka’s leadership skills as captain come in.“As a captain, I have to do a lot. I am not just supposed to play the game. I also have to maintain communication and coordination and take decisions of what play to run and when,” said Khadka. “I know this is going to be tough.”Khadka will be accompanied by Garisha Silwal, Mina Gurung and Rinchen Moktan in the national team. Silwal and Gurung have already played with Khadka in the national women’s basketball. Silwal and Gurung won bronze medals in the 3×3 basketball tournament during the 13th South Asian Games (SAG), held in 2019 in Nepal. Knowing the captainShreya Khadka Shreya Khadka has been playing for the national team since her school days. She made her national team debut at just 16 years old during the 12th South Asian Games in 2016. Including age group tournaments, she has participated in a total of six international tournaments. Four years ago, Khadka was part of the Asian Games, where she played under the leadership of Anusha Malla.But among all of them, the upcoming Asian Games is going to be the most important tournament for her life because of the role she has earned and it has made her excited.“I have set a simple goal of winning one match. It is going to be tough but me and the team are going to give our all to fulfil this goal,” said Khadka.While the goal might not feel huge to many, for the basketball team, it is massive. Nepal has not won a single match in the Asian Games so far and Shreya Khadka and her team want to change that.“If we do that, we can then focus on the 14th South Asian Games where I want to win a gold medal,” she said.Recognising the necessity for enhancing the current state of Nepali basketball, she emphasises the importance of implementing changes at a policy level.“We only look at talents in Kathmandu. We need to take basketball away from the capital and look at players from across the country. Doing that will help improve the level,” she said.Additionally, she hopes the national team can have its own dedicated basketball court where they can train anytime.“These are small aspirations that can be achieved though planning nad hard work,” says Khadka.",['nepal secur easi win bahrain'],"['shreya khadka hot summer day , shreya khadka teammat train hard .', 'sweat drip face put work basketbal court mamba sport center .', 'hot humid , khadka team run around variou drill prepar take part upcom asian game 2023 go held hangzhou , china.khadka , 23 , captain nepal ’ basketbal team repres nepal 3×3 basketbal asian game .', 'member team play intern level 3×3 basketbal tournament .', 'part nepal ’ team took part 2019 asian game , know tough oppon go be . “ third time take part 3×3 basketbal competit asian game .', 'want play well win least one game year , ” khadka said.gear asian game nation women ’ team practis asian game , slate septemb shreya khadka member nation women ’ team train past three month .', 'take part least 10 practic session week .', 'date tournament near , team feel confid seen perform get better time.khadka known need win game asian game . “ win singl game 2019 realis take win .', 'physic enough time work , ” said .', '“ anoth import takeaway tournament height matter . ” although acknowledg signific role height play basketbal , hold belief assumpt tall player inher skill fals . “ ’ skill strength work , ” said.to get stronger compet physic rest asia , team powerlift play men . “ ’ also eat right , ” khadka said.ling challengesshreya khadka accompani garisha silwal , mina gurung rinchen moktan nation team .', 'team show unwav commit tournament .', 'howev , team say face variou challeng one lack consist effect train session help team dedic practic facil instead make use rent space two locat : surya sport centr dhumbarahi mamba sport center buddhanagar .', 'disadvantag reli rent venu practic schedul depend court avail , furthermor , court lack necessari train equip resources.moreov , format 3×3 basketbal tournament also compar differ full-court basketbal tournament .', 'anoth challeng shreya khadka team .', 'contrast convent basketbal game , team ’ coach present next .', 'instead , coach requir occupi seat audienc prohibit provid form verbal symbol instructions.thi khadka ’ leadership skill captain come in . “ captain , lot .', 'suppos play game .', 'also maintain commun coordin take decis play run , ” said khadka .', '“ know go tough . ” khadka accompani garisha silwal , mina gurung rinchen moktan nation team .', 'silwal gurung alreadi play khadka nation women ’ basketbal .', 'silwal gurung bronz medal 3×3 basketbal tournament 13th south asian game ( sag ) , held 2019 nepal .', 'know captainshreya khadka shreya khadka play nation team sinc school day .', 'made nation team debut 16 year old 12th south asian game 2016 .', 'includ age group tournament , particip total six intern tournament .', 'four year ago , khadka part asian game , play leadership anusha malla.but among , upcom asian game go import tournament life role earn made excit . “ set simpl goal win one match .', 'go tough team go give fulfil goal , ” said khadka.whil goal might feel huge mani , basketbal team , massiv .', 'nepal singl match asian game far shreya khadka team want chang that . “ , focu 14th south asian game want win gold medal , ” said.recognis necess enhanc current state nepali basketbal , emphasis import implement chang polici level . “ look talent kathmandu .', 'need take basketbal away capit look player across countri .', 'help improv level , ” said.addit , hope nation team dedic basketbal court train anytim . “ small aspir achiev though plan nad hard work , ” say khadka .']"

T20I Women’s Quadrangular Series: Nepal lose to hosts Malaysia,"Gyanendra MallaAfter 17 long years playing for Nepal’s cricket team, Gyanendra Malla on August 4 announced he was retiring from international cricket. In the course of his career, the 32-year-old experienced a transformative journey, as he was part of a team that climbed their way from the ICC World Cricket League – Division 5 to attaining the coveted ODI status.“I think the timing is right. I’ve given all that I could and when you’re not giving 100 per cent, I feel it was time to get away,” said Malla adding he will probably not play in domestic leagues either.End of an era Malla was one of the last members of Nepal’s golden generation that did more than just win games. They entertained the Nepali audience and gave the fans the belief that anything is possible. Evidence of that is how they qualified for the T20 World Cup in Bangladesh inspiring a new generation of cricketers in the process.That was not all, Gyanendra Malla along with his long-time captain Paras Khadka and Shakti Gauchan played an integral role in getting the coveted ODI status in 2018 to solidify their legacy in Nepali cricket. However, as Malla joins the ranks of Khadka and Gauchan in bidding farewell to his international career, it is safe to say that an era has come to a close.“Their generation redefined cricket in Nepal. Players like Paras and Gyanendra are why the new generation dreamt of playing cricket. We were the first generation but I this team led by Paras and Gyanendra are the golden generation,” said Jagat Tamata. “I feel a little sad and emotional.”However, Gyanendra Malla believes that the present moment is opportune for him to bid farewell. He believes that the cricket team is on a positive trajectory and having devoted his utmost, he now desires to step back and relish the experience of observing the team in action.The journey has not been as rosy though. After Khadka resigned, Malla took over the captaincy of the team. The team, which was under transition, did not do well and he only managed to win 15 games out of 32.Things took an ugly turn in 2021 when he was suspended as captain and removed from the team by CAN President Chatur Bahadur Chand following a dispute over the grading of players in the central contract.The decision to suspend Gyanendra Malla and vice-captain Dipendra Singh Airee was met with resistance from a number of individuals who questioned the reasoning behind it. The environment became tense, with the team teetering on the brink of factionalism. However, the situation eventually calmed down, leading to Malla’s eventual reinstatement in the national team. Malla felt he felt he owed it to the young players to demonstrate his selflessness and leadership qualities again.Following his return, Nepal went on a series of wins under the leadership of Rohit Paudel retaining the ODI status, playing in the World Cup Qualifier in Zimbabwe and qualifying for the Asia Cup.“Everything is going great. I wish the team the best of luck,” he says.A young man’s dreamBorn in Bhimsensthan in Kathmandu, Gyanendra Malla started his cricketing journey in 2005 during the Asia U15 Cup. In that very year, he secured a spot in both the U17 and U19 teams. He was part of Nepal’s U19 team that went on win the Plate Cup in the U19 World Cup beating New Zealand in the final.This performance in the tournament landed him a place in the national team as he made his senior debut in 2006 in a 4-day match against Namibia in the ICC Intercontinental Cup qualifier in Windhoek.In 2012, at the ACC Trophy Elite held in Saudi Arabia, Gyanendra Malla delivered a standout performance by scoring a 17-ball half-century. Over the course of the tournament, he accumulated a total of 212 runs, including two half-centuries, playing a pivotal role in Nepal reaching the final and sharing trophy with the UAE.However, as he retires he might carry a tinge of disappointment he never made big runs for Nepal. Fans often say that he fell short of meeting the lofty expectations placed upon him, a notion he does not shy away from acknowledging. “I don’t know why I was not able to score big runs,” he says.Gyanendra Malla, who embraces his identity as a cricketer, cherishes the T20 World Cup in Bangladesh as his most memorable experience. However, not being able to participate in tests and the ODI World Cup leaves a sense of unfulfillment in his career aspirations. “I hope the younger generation can fulfil our dream,” he says.Over the past year, Malla found himself as the sole seasoned cricketer amidst a lineup predominantly composed of younger players. Once suspended from the captaincy, he transitioned into a mentor figure, offering valuable guidance and support to his teammates.According to the younger players, Malla held a crucial role within the national team, effectively managing the squad and providing them with valuable guidance and mentorship.Rohit Kumar Paudel, captain of the national team, has also appreciated Malla’s contribution through a social media post. “From leading the team to glorious victories to setting an example of dedication, guiding us through highs and lows, it’s been an incredible journey,” writes Paudel. “The selflessness, sacrifices, and invaluable support you’ve extended to me is priceless.”Similarly, his longtime captain and friend Khadka calls him a champion cricketer, a resilient warrior, and an exceptional teammate.“Congratulations, Gyanu for serving the nation with utmost pride, grace and most importantly putting in all the effort for years and years with dedication, consistency and selflessness,” writes Khakda on Facebook.  “It was an honour and a privilege to share the dressing room with you and the memories that we carry through years of seeing Nepali cricket and cricketers grow will never fade away.”An international cricketer has taken to social media to pay tribute to Malla upon his retirement. In an appreciation post, Rohan Mustafa, a cricketer from the UAE, commends Malla, stating, “Your impact on Nepali cricket will always be remembered. Beyond being a player, you are a remarkable individual.”",['t20i women ’ quadrangular seri : nepal lose host malaysia'],"['gyanendra mallaaft 17 long year play nepal ’ cricket team , gyanendra malla august 4 announc retir intern cricket .', 'cours career , 32-year-old experienc transform journey , part team climb way icc world cricket leagu – divis 5 attain covet odi statu . “ think time right .', '’ given could ’ give 100 per cent , feel time get away , ” said malla ad probabl play domest leagu either.end era malla one last member nepal ’ golden gener win game .', 'entertain nepali audienc gave fan belief anyth possibl .', 'evid qualifi t20 world cup bangladesh inspir new gener cricket process.that , gyanendra malla along long-tim captain para khadka shakti gauchan play integr role get covet odi statu 2018 solidifi legaci nepali cricket .', 'howev , malla join rank khadka gauchan bid farewel intern career , safe say era come close . “ gener redefin cricket nepal .', 'player like para gyanendra new gener dreamt play cricket .', 'first gener team led para gyanendra golden gener , ” said jagat tamata .', '“ feel littl sad emot . ” howev , gyanendra malla believ present moment opportun bid farewel .', 'believ cricket team posit trajectori devot utmost , desir step back relish experi observ team action.th journey rosi though .', 'khadka resign , malla took captainci team .', 'team , transit , well manag win 15 game 32.thing took ugli turn 2021 suspend captain remov team presid chatur bahadur chand follow disput grade player central contract.th decis suspend gyanendra malla vice-captain dipendra singh aire met resist number individu question reason behind .', 'environ becam tens , team teeter brink faction .', 'howev , situat eventu calm , lead malla ’ eventu reinstat nation team .', 'malla felt felt owe young player demonstr selfless leadership qualiti again.follow return , nepal went seri win leadership rohit paudel retain odi statu , play world cup qualifi zimbabw qualifi asia cup . “ everyth go great .', 'wish team best luck , ” says.a young man ’ dreamborn bhimsensthan kathmandu , gyanendra malla start cricket journey 2005 asia u15 cup .', 'year , secur spot u17 u19 team .', 'part nepal ’ u19 team went win plate cup u19 world cup beat new zealand final.thi perform tournament land place nation team made senior debut 2006 4-day match namibia icc intercontinent cup qualifi windhoek.in 2012 , acc trophi elit held saudi arabia , gyanendra malla deliv standout perform score 17-ball half-centuri .', 'cours tournament , accumul total 212 run , includ two half-centuri , play pivot role nepal reach final share trophi uae.howev , retir might carri ting disappoint never made big run nepal .', 'fan often say fell short meet lofti expect place upon , notion shi away acknowledg .', '“ ’ know abl score big run , ” says.gyanendra malla , embrac ident cricket , cherish t20 world cup bangladesh memor experi .', 'howev , abl particip test odi world cup leav sens unfulfil career aspir .', '“ hope younger gener fulfil dream , ” says.ov past year , malla found sole season cricket amidst lineup predominantli compos younger player .', 'suspend captainci , transit mentor figur , offer valuabl guidanc support teammates.accord younger player , malla held crucial role within nation team , effect manag squad provid valuabl guidanc mentorship.rohit kumar paudel , captain nation team , also appreci malla ’ contribut social media post .', '“ lead team gloriou victori set exampl dedic , guid us high low , ’ incred journey , ” write paudel .', '“ selfless , sacrific , invalu support ’ extend priceless . ” similarli , longtim captain friend khadka call champion cricket , resili warrior , except teammat . “ congratul , gyanu serv nation utmost pride , grace importantli put effort year year dedic , consist selfless , ” write khakda facebook .', '“ honour privileg share dress room memori carri year see nepali cricket cricket grow never fade away . ” intern cricket taken social media pay tribut malla upon retir .', 'appreci post , rohan mustafa , cricket uae , commend malla , state , “ impact nepali cricket alway rememb .', 'beyond player , remark individu . ”']"
T20I Women’s Quadrangular Series: Nepal beat Kuwait to maintain 100 per cent record,"As untouched and less discussed as the sports management industry is in Nepal, it has ample room to showcase creativity. Photo by Miguel Bruna on UnsplashIn 2023, Barbie named Women in Sports as their career of the year.Whenever I am out and about socially, there is always someone who seems pretty certain about not considering my profession as mainstream. Hold up! Sports as a career? In Nepal? You bet! This article aims to explain why women in this male-dominant sports industry in Nepal should not be viewed as a surprise.I have been part of the Nepali cricket industry in a private capacity for quite a while now. Armed with a Master’s Degree in IT from an American University, my choice to stick with sports management tends to raise eyebrows. While I am not an on-field player, I am definitely behind the scenes, playing strong games of serious deliverance with my team. We are all about creating what is not there.As untouched and less discussed as the sports management industry is in Nepal, it has ample room to showcase creativity. Being a commanding woman in a position can be challenging, but on the brighter side, the gender advantage has yet to fail me. As alien as I might be in sports management in Nepal, I have been accepted with open arms. The nature of the job is highly competitive, no doubt.Embraced by the sports fraternityPhoto: PixabayWomen in sports are safe, heard, and welcomed. I absolutely relish the addition of spirited women to the team. The nuances of sports are something women complement greatly. Sports management inherently rejects narrow minds. There is a lot of travelling, meeting people, experimenting, and remembering limitations. The adjustments are both trivial and clever. Often, in our part of the world, societal norms limit women from making career decisions, hindering them from living life on their terms. This restriction potentially keeps many capable women from pursuing the sports industry, where they could truly wield their power to make an impact. Change is gradual, and I hope to see numerous female faces in charge of stadiums someday in Nepal.Yes, there are challenges. It ranges from personal sacrifices to job security and opportunities. However, these are workable factors for any freelancer in sports management. The key is excelling at our jobs to thrive anywhere. Taking a page from the medical field, the seriousness we apply there should not differ in sports management. Sports is a powerful industry. Children grow up idolising what we showcase on TV. As glorious as the game is, it is every child’s dream to represent their country someday. Carrying that responsibility is our role in sports—an often thankless yet deeply satisfying job.Nepali sports industryThe fans went wild at TU Cricket Ground after Nepal beat UAE.Sports may be a smaller industry in Nepal, but globally, it is a behemoth. The world economy has shifted, and it is time we alter our perspective to recognise the potential of sports as an industry in Nepal. The idea of open commercialisation of sports remains somewhat unexplored, as it continues to be a more exclusive affair in Nepal. By sourcing innovative ideas, there’s a wealth of public attention and investment waiting to be tapped into, along with numerous practices to establish and discard. As the Nepali team achieves international records, the packaging of the sport becomes everything. There is plenty to learn from international sports management to make our industry highly marketable and poised for global entry.Sports such as cricket, football, volleyball, or even golf serve as key intersections for reshaping Nepal’s global narrative. Over the years, Kabaddi has witnessed a substantial surge in India, both in terms of viewership and commercial success. The primary challenge we grapple with is Nepal’s comparatively small market size, posing constraints on our ability to generate substantial economic gains. Therefore, there is unanimous agreement on the imperative for Nepal’s sports to venture onto the international stage.Nepal boasts many hardworking individuals, yet achieving this goal demands specialised talents in sports management with the requisite experience and the capacity to enhance existing values. In the long run, outsourcing such talents may foster dependence. Hence, a concerted effort is needed to inspire Nepali youth to engage in sports management, contributing to our sports ecosystem. There are various ways in which we can harness the potential of sports for our benefit. Encouraging youth involvement can be instrumental in capitalising on the multifaceted opportunities presented by the sports industry. There is a lot to explore if you think about it.",['t20i women ’ quadrangular seri : nepal beat kuwait maintain 100 per cent record'],"['untouch less discuss sport manag industri nepal , ampl room showcas creativ .', 'photo miguel bruna unsplashin 2023 , barbi name women sport career year.whenev social , alway someon seem pretti certain consid profess mainstream .', 'hold !', 'sport career ?', 'nepal ?', 'bet !', 'articl aim explain women male-domin sport industri nepal view surprise.i part nepali cricket industri privat capac quit .', 'arm master ’ degre american univers , choic stick sport manag tend rais eyebrow .', 'on-field player , definit behind scene , play strong game seriou deliver team .', 'creat there.a untouch less discuss sport manag industri nepal , ampl room showcas creativ .', 'command woman posit challeng , brighter side , gender advantag yet fail .', 'alien might sport manag nepal , accept open arm .', 'natur job highli competit , doubt.embrac sport fraternityphoto : pixabaywomen sport safe , heard , welcom .', 'absolut relish addit spirit women team .', 'nuanc sport someth women complement greatli .', 'sport manag inher reject narrow mind .', 'lot travel , meet peopl , experi , rememb limit .', 'adjust trivial clever .', 'often , part world , societ norm limit women make career decis , hinder live life term .', 'restrict potenti keep mani capabl women pursu sport industri , could truli wield power make impact .', 'chang gradual , hope see numer femal face charg stadium someday nepal.y , challeng .', 'rang person sacrific job secur opportun .', 'howev , workabl factor freelanc sport manag .', 'key excel job thrive anywher .', 'take page medic field , serious appli differ sport manag .', 'sport power industri .', 'children grow idolis showcas tv .', 'gloriou game , everi child ’ dream repres countri someday .', 'carri respons role sports—an often thankless yet deepli satisfi job.nepali sport industryth fan went wild tu cricket ground nepal beat uae.sport may smaller industri nepal , global , behemoth .', 'world economi shift , time alter perspect recognis potenti sport industri nepal .', 'idea open commercialis sport remain somewhat unexplor , continu exclus affair nepal .', 'sourc innov idea , ’ wealth public attent invest wait tap , along numer practic establish discard .', 'nepali team achiev intern record , packag sport becom everyth .', 'plenti learn intern sport manag make industri highli market pois global entry.sport cricket , footbal , volleybal , even golf serv key intersect reshap nepal ’ global narr .', 'year , kabaddi wit substanti surg india , term viewership commerci success .', 'primari challeng grappl nepal ’ compar small market size , pose constraint abil gener substanti econom gain .', 'therefor , unanim agreement imper nepal ’ sport ventur onto intern stage.nep boast mani hardwork individu , yet achiev goal demand specialis talent sport manag requisit experi capac enhanc exist valu .', 'long run , outsourc talent may foster depend .', 'henc , concert effort need inspir nepali youth engag sport manag , contribut sport ecosystem .', 'variou way har potenti sport benefit .', 'encourag youth involv instrument capitalis multifacet opportun present sport industri .', 'lot explor think .']"
Asia Cup: Cricket team leaves for Pakistan to face their biggest test yet,"Painting ‘My Private Life’ by artist Priyam Pradhan at the exhibition Mani at Siddhartha Art Gallery, Baber Mahal. Photo: Chandra Bahadur AleUsing Pitt’s artist pen on paper, artist Priyam Pradhan presents My Private Life, a showcase of the current significance of his life depicted in abstract form.At the centre of the painting is a 1000-rupee note, within which Pradhan has intricately painted Lord Krishna, a man wearing a hoodie tenderly embracing his dog, and a woman. The woman stands tall, elongated in form. Towards the bottom of the canvas, a holy man reaches out his hands, appearing to be in flight.Priyam Pradhan has used a vibrant colour palette, incorporating bright hues such as pink, orange, and yellow, as well as green, black, white, and grey. This combination adds a dynamic and lively quality to the artwork.“The man in the centre is me and the girl in green is my girlfriend. And the faces are my mom and dad,” says Pradhan. “The sadhu (holy man) symbolises my desires that I don’t have many desires for materialistic things however I do understand the value of money.”The use of colours, figures and lines in an abstract form in his painting resembles the painting of American painter Paul Jackson Pollock. Like his abstract expressionism, Pradhan has expressed himself in his painting.Furthermore, this marks Priyam Pradhan’s third solo painting exhibition titled Mani (money), inaugurated on January 17 at Siddhartha Art Gallery, Baber Mahal.In his previous exhibitions, Pradhan’s artworks centred around Hindu philosophy and his spontaneous thought process. However, in this latest exhibition, he explores the theme of money and its impact on an individual’s life, delving into the reverberating effects of financial aspects.Understanding the value of moneyPaintings by artist Priyam Pradhan at Siddhartha Art Gallery, Baber Mahal. Photo: Chandra Bahadur AleAny form of art is known as a reflection of the contemporary time. Likewise, Priyam Pradhan’s paintings reflect the lifestyle, desires, obligations and more of today’s younger generation living in urban areas in Nepal.Pradhan himself is in his 20s and he has justified the want of most of the youngsters in their 20s, who might be declared adults and understand the need for money and materialistic things but are still kids at their heart who want to explore and experience life as much as possible.The exhibition has 27 paintings which Pradhan took around nine months to complete. According to him, while he was travelling the idea that his life was luxurious and him being capable of exploring anything he wanted to was because of money.And being an artist this concept lingered on him and he was compelled to create on the theme of money.Once you enter the gallery, you can also view an animated video, which introduces artist Pradhan and the importance of money, which is on the ground floor. On the first floor, a huge painting (193×62 in cm) Apatkalin Awastha using mixed media on canvas welcomes you and other paintings are small in size (18×30 in cm).“It is a team work and it is my introduction as an artist for the exhibition,” he says. “Also, being a recent multimedia graduate from Islington College, I wanted to explore my skills and I got my team. Then, like money, multimedia is relevant to current society.”Experiencing life through artPainting by artist Priyam Pradhan at Siddhartha Art Gallery, Baber Mahal. Photo: Chandra Bahadur Ale Priyam Pradhan says enjoyment is the meaning of life and he enjoys creating artwork. Moreover, Pradhan who came into the art world first being a tattoo artist feels blessed that he has the privilege to explore whatever he likes in his life.He also believes that the philosophy that says one should not be materialistic is wrong. “If material things are not important, why would one build a house? And after building a house why do they want to decorate their house?” he questions.Alongside, money and materialistic things, his paintings also explore love, romance, life and childhood experiences. Motifs like Pokemon, ramen noodles, animals, dancers, etc have been used in his paintings. In most of his paintings, he has used numerous white lines in wavy form and these lines for Pradhan indicate the sound or the energy that exists in the surroundings all the time.About using a pitta artist pen, he says, “I have enjoyed drawing and painting since my childhood and using a pitta artist pen helps me revisit that feeling of happiness and sense of freedom.”So many things happening on the canvas with the use of vibrant colours gives a sense of excitement to the viewers. Though referencing artists like Pollock, MF Husain, Picasso and more, his pen strokes give a sense of newness through his expression and thoughts about his life experiences.In his paintings, these bright colours and motifs are in harmony and are visual treats that can surely cheer up the mood of any visitor. Moreover, you can also get free stickers from the artist.If you too are in a gloomy mood and want to uplift a little, visit the exhibition that continues till February 6.",['asia cup : cricket team leav pakistan face biggest test yet'],"['paint ‘ privat life ’ artist priyam pradhan exhibit mani siddhartha art galleri , baber mahal .', 'photo : chandra bahadur aleus pitt ’ artist pen paper , artist priyam pradhan present privat life , showcas current signific life depict abstract form.at centr paint 1000-rupe note , within pradhan intric paint lord krishna , man wear hoodi tenderli embrac dog , woman .', 'woman stand tall , elong form .', 'toward bottom canva , holi man reach hand , appear flight.priyam pradhan use vibrant colour palett , incorpor bright hue pink , orang , yellow , well green , black , white , grey .', 'combin add dynam live qualiti artwork . “ man centr girl green girlfriend .', 'face mom dad , ” say pradhan .', '“ sadhu ( holi man ) symbolis desir ’ mani desir materialist thing howev understand valu money . ” use colour , figur line abstract form paint resembl paint american painter paul jackson pollock .', 'like abstract expression , pradhan express painting.furthermor , mark priyam pradhan ’ third solo paint exhibit titl mani ( money ) , inaugur januari 17 siddhartha art galleri , baber mahal.in previou exhibit , pradhan ’ artwork centr around hindu philosophi spontan thought process .', 'howev , latest exhibit , explor theme money impact individu ’ life , delv reverber effect financi aspects.understand valu moneypaint artist priyam pradhan siddhartha art galleri , baber mahal .', 'photo : chandra bahadur aleani form art known reflect contemporari time .', 'likewis , priyam pradhan ’ paint reflect lifestyl , desir , oblig today ’ younger gener live urban area nepal.pradhan 20 justifi want youngster 20 , might declar adult understand need money materialist thing still kid heart want explor experi life much possible.th exhibit 27 paint pradhan took around nine month complet .', 'accord , travel idea life luxuri capabl explor anyth want money.and artist concept linger compel creat theme money.onc enter galleri , also view anim video , introduc artist pradhan import money , ground floor .', 'first floor , huge paint ( 193×62 cm ) apatkalin awastha use mix media canva welcom paint small size ( 18×30 cm ) . “ team work introduct artist exhibit , ” say .', '“ also , recent multimedia graduat islington colleg , want explor skill got team .', ', like money , multimedia relev current societi . ” experienc life artpaint artist priyam pradhan siddhartha art galleri , baber mahal .', 'photo : chandra bahadur ale priyam pradhan say enjoy mean life enjoy creat artwork .', 'moreov , pradhan came art world first tattoo artist feel bless privileg explor whatev like life.h also believ philosophi say one materialist wrong .', '“ materi thing import , would one build hous ?', 'build hous want decor hous ? ” questions.alongsid , money materialist thing , paint also explor love , romanc , life childhood experi .', 'motif like pokemon , ramen noodl , anim , dancer , etc use paint .', 'paint , use numer white line wavi form line pradhan indic sound energi exist surround time.about use pitta artist pen , say , “ enjoy draw paint sinc childhood use pitta artist pen help revisit feel happi sens freedom . ” mani thing happen canva use vibrant colour give sens excit viewer .', 'though referenc artist like pollock , mf husain , picasso , pen stroke give sens new express thought life experiences.in paint , bright colour motif harmoni visual treat sure cheer mood visitor .', 'moreov , also get free sticker artist.if gloomi mood want uplift littl , visit exhibit continu till februari 6 .']"
T20I Women’s Quadrangular Series: Nepal beat Hong Kong by 6 wickets,"Entrepreneurship education is not just an investment in the education system; it is an investment in the nation’s future prosperity. Photo: Pexels/ Rodnae ProductionsIn the shadow of the towering Himalayas, Nepal faces a challenge that rivals the steepness of its mountainous terrain- the challenge of economic development. As the nation earnestly pursues its Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), it becomes increasingly evident that a transformation in the education system is not only necessary but also urgent. Rooted in common living strategies, the prevailing education model, especially in higher education, may not adequately prepare the youth for the demands of the modern world. In this critical juncture, the incorporation of entrepreneurship education emerges as a beacon of hope, offering a pathway towards a self-reliant and prosperous Nepal.Time to reevaluate the education systemNepal’s journey towards economic prosperity has been marked by challenges that demand innovative solutions. The commitment of the SDGs reflects not only a global responsibility but also a domestic imperative for sustainable development. For this, it is high time to reevaluate the education system in the country.The current education system in Nepal, deeply entrenched in common living strategies, has been the foundation of learning for generations. However, in the face of a rapidly evolving world, today’s generation aspires for more than the status quo. The call for independence reverberates through the aspirations of youth who seek a curriculum fostering critical thinking, innovation and entrepreneurial skills.Entrepreneurship education is a dynamic force capable of reshaping Nepal’s educational landscape. This innovative approach moves beyond traditional learning methods, providing students with the tools to navigate the complexities of the modern world. At its core, entrepreneurship education is about empowering students to implement learned information in practical and tangible ways.Consider a student engrossed in the intricacies of sensor systems during a science class, entrepreneurship education transforms this theoretical knowledge into practical applications, inspiring the creation of a sensor-operated door. Such innovation born from a fusion of science and entrepreneurship becomes a valuable mindset in solving practical problems.  Expanding the horizons of entrepreneurship education, let us delve into chemistry. Imagine students studying chemistry not just as a theoretical subject, but also as entrepreneurs in the making. Armed with entrepreneurial principles, these students can tap into Nepal’s rich biodiversity, exploring market demands for products derived from local plants.In the scenario, chemistry students could embark on a journey to develop performance-enhancing products based on market demand, harnessing the potential of indigenous flora. What makes this approach remarkable is that it does not necessarily require sophisticated machines or extensive human resources. Instead, it leverages the inherent skills and awareness of individuals within the community, paving the way for a grassroots economic revolution.Entrepreneurship in education Representational graphic. Image: FreepikThe beauty of entrepreneurship education lies in its universal applicability. It is not confined to science or chemistry alone. Consider an art student, for example. Through entrepreneurship education, they can understand what art to develop (product), how much to set the price (price), where to sell (place) and how to sell (promote) their artworks. Every subject becomes a canvas for innovation and enterprise.Moreover, entrepreneurship education is a powerful equaliser, recognising the unique skills and talents of individuals across various disciplines. It is not about fitting into a predefined mould but rather about unleashing the potential within each student. When every single person is aware of their skills and potential, they can rise to different levels, contributing to the overall progress of the nation.Entrepreneurship education goes beyond skill recognition; it is about nurturing the ability to produce goods and mastering the art of marketing. Returning to the example of the student developing a sensor-operated door, entrepreneurship education not only equips them to produce the product but also teaches them how to navigate the complexities of marketing it to potential users and clients.The impact of entrepreneurship education extends beyond individual success stories; it reverberates through the entire nation. A generation equipped with entrepreneurial skills becomes a driving force for economic growth and independence. They will be able to recognise the resources and ideas to utilise them to reach the global market. They will be able to be the pioneers in products and contribute to the economy. By fostering a culture of innovation, creativity and self-reliance, Nepal can reduce its dependence on external sources and strengthen its economy from within.In essence, entrepreneurship education is not just an investment in the education system; it is an investment in the nation’s future prosperity. It is a transformative force that has the potential to shape a generation of independent thinkers, innovators and entrepreneurs- the architects of a self-reliant and economically vibrant Nepal. Entrepreneurship education, by teaching students to utilise available resources (physical and financial) and make them commercial, becomes a cornerstone in the nation’s journey towards economic empowerment and independence.",['t20i women ’ quadrangular seri : nepal beat hong kong 6 wicket'],"['entrepreneurship educ invest educ system ; invest nation ’ futur prosper .', 'photo : pexels/ rodna productionsin shadow tower himalaya , nepal face challeng rival steep mountain terrain- challeng econom develop .', 'nation earnestli pursu sustain develop goal ( sdg ) , becom increasingli evid transform educ system necessari also urgent .', 'root common live strategi , prevail educ model , especi higher educ , may adequ prepar youth demand modern world .', 'critic junctur , incorpor entrepreneurship educ emerg beacon hope , offer pathway toward self-reli prosper nepal.tim reevalu educ systemnep ’ journey toward econom prosper mark challeng demand innov solut .', 'commit sdg reflect global respons also domest imper sustain develop .', ', high time reevalu educ system country.th current educ system nepal , deepli entrench common live strategi , foundat learn gener .', 'howev , face rapidli evolv world , today ’ gener aspir statu quo .', 'call independ reverber aspir youth seek curriculum foster critic think , innov entrepreneuri skills.entrepreneurship educ dynam forc capabl reshap nepal ’ educ landscap .', 'innov approach move beyond tradit learn method , provid student tool navig complex modern world .', 'core , entrepreneurship educ empow student implement learn inform practic tangibl ways.consid student engross intricaci sensor system scienc class , entrepreneurship educ transform theoret knowledg practic applic , inspir creation sensor-oper door .', 'innov born fusion scienc entrepreneurship becom valuabl mindset solv practic problem .', 'expand horizon entrepreneurship educ , let us delv chemistri .', 'imagin student studi chemistri theoret subject , also entrepreneur make .', 'arm entrepreneuri principl , student tap nepal ’ rich biodivers , explor market demand product deriv local plants.in scenario , chemistri student could embark journey develop performance-enhanc product base market demand , har potenti indigen flora .', 'make approach remark necessarili requir sophist machin extens human resourc .', 'instead , leverag inher skill awar individu within commun , pave way grassroot econom revolution.entrepreneurship educ represent graphic .', 'imag : freepikth beauti entrepreneurship educ lie univers applic .', 'confin scienc chemistri alon .', 'consid art student , exampl .', 'entrepreneurship educ , understand art develop ( product ) , much set price ( price ) , sell ( place ) sell ( promot ) artwork .', 'everi subject becom canva innov enterprise.moreov , entrepreneurship educ power equalis , recognis uniqu skill talent individu across variou disciplin .', 'fit predefin mould rather unleash potenti within student .', 'everi singl person awar skill potenti , rise differ level , contribut overal progress nation.entrepreneurship educ goe beyond skill recognit ; nurtur abil produc good master art market .', 'return exampl student develop sensor-oper door , entrepreneurship educ equip produc product also teach navig complex market potenti user clients.th impact entrepreneurship educ extend beyond individu success stori ; reverber entir nation .', 'gener equip entrepreneuri skill becom drive forc econom growth independ .', 'abl recognis resourc idea utilis reach global market .', 'abl pioneer product contribut economi .', 'foster cultur innov , creativ self-reli , nepal reduc depend extern sourc strengthen economi within.in essenc , entrepreneurship educ invest educ system ; invest nation ’ futur prosper .', 'transform forc potenti shape gener independ thinker , innov entrepreneurs- architect self-reli econom vibrant nepal .', 'entrepreneurship educ , teach student utilis avail resourc ( physic financi ) make commerci , becom cornerston nation ’ journey toward econom empower independ .']"

Asia Cup: Cricket team to fly to Pakistan next week,"Ram Bujhaun Yadav with his land ownership certificate stands near a border pillar which he says was erroneously placed on his land. In October 2023, when 51-year-old Ram Bujhaun Yadav of Musaharnia Rural Municipality-5, Mukhiyapatti, Dhanusha, was at a relative’s house, someone told him that two Indian Sashastra Seema Bal (SSB) personnel were looking for him.Anxious, he rushed home wondering why they were looking for him.“They asked me if the paddy field in the no man’s land was mine. I told them yes and they asked me to cut down the paddy immediately,” he said.The paddy was not ripe and Yadav asked them for some time. However, the SSB personnel told him he had to cut down his paddy immediately.Ram Bujhaun and his wife Tetari Devi each own a 677-square-metre plot of land. As Nepal and India reevaluated the border, Ram Bujhan’s land was been deemed to be near the no man’s land as it now has two demarcation pillars.Frustrated, Ram Bujhaun cut the paddy before it was due to be harvested. Now, he has been asked to not plant anything on the land as it falls in the no man’s land.“Our border police don’t say a word. I can’t fight the SSB on my own,” says Ram Bujhaun adding he had decided not to plan anything on the land anymore.Woes of the farmersMany farmers in southern Nepal say their land has now been placed in India after the recent demarcation. When the Jamuna River, which flows through the no man’s land between Nepal and India, changed its course some two decades ago, some border pillars went missing. Locals say these pillars have now been placed encroaching on Nepali land.In 2018, with the then Chief District Officer of Dhanusha, Pradeep Raj Kandel, and an official from Madhubani district, Bihar, India, a team that included border security forces from both countries, the Armed Police Force of Nepal, and SSB of India began placing border pillars after land measurement by technicians.Locals have raised concerns, stating that border pillars have been positioned, encroaching approximately 50 to 100 meters of land into Nepal compared to the previous position. Many like Ram Bujhaun are unaware of when these border pillars were placed.“I did not know that pillar was placed here. After I found out when I asked the village leaders, many said they were placing the border pillars as they pleased,” said Ram Bujhaun.He was told to carry on planting paddy and that it would not matter as these issues had happened in the past. “They encroached on my land and have asked me not to plant anything. This is gross injustice,” he says.Ram Bujhaun’s family owns a total of 4,000 square metres of land, with 2,000 square metres belonging to him and the remaining 2,000 square metres to his brother Bechan. However, 1,000 square metres of his land is now located on the Indian side after the demarcation. Despite this, he has been farming on the land and continues to pay taxes to the Department of Land Management and Archive in Nepal.“They have marked my land to be on the Indian side and placed border pillars on it. I’ve been farming till now but I don’t know when they will ask me to stop,” he says.Ignorance of the governmentThe Madhesh province in southern NepalThe former ward chair of Mukhiyapatti Musharniya Rural Municipality-5, Ram Naresh Yadav, said that over time, India has encroached on numerous Nepali lands in various locations in the Madhesh Province. This, he says, happened due to the Nepali administration’s ignorance and weak stature.“They (Nepali administration) were careless and that meant the Indian side placed these border pillars by encroaching on Nepali land,” says Ram Naresh.He said that over 40 farmers from wards 1, 5, and 6 have land ranging from 300 to 1,600 square metres on the Indian side. “These farmers have land ownership certificates, but they cannot farm as the SSB says the land is in India and not Nepal,” said Ram Naresh.In 1996, land ownership certificates were distributed after surveying the land in the border area. Local Dharmendra Kumar Yadav said that since then, the locals have been paying their land tax regularly. In 2018, when the pillar was being placed, the locals protested when they saw their land was being encroached on. However, since the demarcation had been agreed upon by high-ranking government officials of Nepal and India, the farmer’s voices went unheard.“We tried to stop when the border pillars were being placed on our land. But the administrators from both sides forcibly put it there without even trying to hold a discussion,” said Harish Chandra Yadav. The Chief District Officer of Dhanusha, Chakrapani Pandey, says that the border pillars were placed by the technical team after the measurements and with the agreement of the high-ranking officials of the two countries.“The fields and houses that are built in no man’s land have recently been cleared. No one can do anything in this particular area,” said Pandey. “We understand the people’s concern but we cannot do anything about it now.”",['asia cup : cricket team fli pakistan next week'],"['ram bujhaun yadav land ownership certif stand near border pillar say erron place land .', 'octob 2023 , 51-year-old ram bujhaun yadav musaharnia rural municipality-5 , mukhiyapatti , dhanusha , rel ’ hous , someon told two indian sashastra seema bal ( ssb ) personnel look him.anxi , rush home wonder look him . “ ask paddi field man ’ land mine .', 'told ye ask cut paddi immedi , ” said.th paddi ripe yadav ask time .', 'howev , ssb personnel told cut paddi immediately.ram bujhaun wife tetari devi 677-square-metr plot land .', 'nepal india reevalu border , ram bujhan ’ land deem near man ’ land two demarc pillars.frustr , ram bujhaun cut paddi due harvest .', ', ask plant anyth land fall man ’ land . “ border polic ’ say word .', '’ fight ssb , ” say ram bujhaun ad decid plan anyth land anymore.wo farmersmani farmer southern nepal say land place india recent demarc .', 'jamuna river , flow man ’ land nepal india , chang cours two decad ago , border pillar went miss .', 'local say pillar place encroach nepali land.in 2018 , chief district offic dhanusha , pradeep raj kandel , offici madhubani district , bihar , india , team includ border secur forc countri , arm polic forc nepal , ssb india began place border pillar land measur technicians.loc rais concern , state border pillar posit , encroach approxim 50 100 meter land nepal compar previou posit .', 'mani like ram bujhaun unawar border pillar place . “ know pillar place .', 'found ask villag leader , mani said place border pillar pleas , ” said ram bujhaun.h told carri plant paddi would matter issu happen past .', '“ encroach land ask plant anyth .', 'gross injustic , ” says.ram bujhaun ’ famili own total 4,000 squar metr land , 2,000 squar metr belong remain 2,000 squar metr brother bechan .', 'howev , 1,000 squar metr land locat indian side demarc .', 'despit , farm land continu pay tax depart land manag archiv nepal . “ mark land indian side place border pillar .', '’ farm till ’ know ask stop , ” says.ignor governmentth madhesh provinc southern nepalth former ward chair mukhiyapatti musharniya rural municipality-5 , ram naresh yadav , said time , india encroach numer nepali land variou locat madhesh provinc .', ', say , happen due nepali administr ’ ignor weak statur . “ ( nepali administr ) careless meant indian side place border pillar encroach nepali land , ” say ram naresh.h said 40 farmer ward 1 , 5 , 6 land rang 300 1,600 squar metr indian side .', '“ farmer land ownership certif , farm ssb say land india nepal , ” said ram naresh.in 1996 , land ownership certif distribut survey land border area .', 'local dharmendra kumar yadav said sinc , local pay land tax regularli .', '2018 , pillar place , local protest saw land encroach .', 'howev , sinc demarc agre upon high-rank govern offici nepal india , farmer ’ voic went unheard . “ tri stop border pillar place land .', 'administr side forcibl put without even tri hold discuss , ” said harish chandra yadav .', 'chief district offic dhanusha , chakrapani pandey , say border pillar place technic team measur agreement high-rank offici two countri . “ field hous built man ’ land recent clear .', 'one anyth particular area , ” said pandey .', '“ understand peopl ’ concern anyth . ”']"
CAN announces 17-member team for Asia Cup,"Regenerative braking representational image. Photo: FreepikThe electric vehicle market in Nepal has grown significantly over the past year. Electric four-wheelers and two-wheelers are being launched almost every month, spanning from passenger to commercial vehicles. Electric transportation appears to be an emerging trend in the automotive industry.New EVs are regularly introduced with advanced features as car companies develop unique electric platforms. One standout feature is regenerative braking.Regenerative braking was first introduced in 1967 by the American Motor Car Company (AMC) in their prototype electric vehicle, the AMC Amitron. However, Toyota became the automobile manufacturer to implement regenerative braking system (RBS) technology in their Prius series hybrid vehicles in 1997. Toyota brought up the new hybrid technology in the Prius when fuel prices were going up at a massive rate. 1997 Toyota Prius Hybrid. Photo: ToyotaBut what is regenerative braking? There are still many people confused about what it is, whether it is safe or helpful in fuel economy in hybrid cars and the regeneration of electricity in electric cars.In simple terms, regen braking is when a car saves energy by recharging its battery when you brake, helping it use less fuel or electricity and go further. Easy but scientifically, regen braking is a process used in vehicles where the kinetic energy produced during braking is converted into electrical energy through an electric motor acting as a generator. This electrical energy is then stored in the vehicle’s battery for later use, reducing energy wastage and increasing overall efficiency.Photo: FreepikRegen braking can be seen in all kinds of EVs, including cars, scooters, commercial vans, buses, bicycles, three-wheelers, and rickshaws. It now can be electrically managed to what extent the power and braking can be generated. Regenerative Braking work process in EVPrinciple of Operation: Regene braking works by turning the energy from slowing down into electricity.Electric Motor as a Generator: In EV or hybrid cars with regen braking, the motor changes roles from moving the car to making electricity when you brake.Switching Polarity: When you brake, the motor switches directions, turning energy from the wheels into electricity instead of using it to move the car.Generation of Electricity: The turning wheels make the motor produce electricity, which goes to the car’s battery.Power Electronics: Special electronics change the electricity from the motor into the right kind for charging the battery.Battery Charging: The electricity made during braking charges up the car’s battery, storing the energy for later.Integration with Hydraulic Braking System: Regenerative braking works with the regular brakes, blending them for smooth stopping.Photo: automotive-iqAdvantages and Disadvantages of Regenerative Braking The advantages are listed below:Energy Efficiency: Regenerative braking efficiently captures the kinetic energy generated during braking, effectively reducing energy wastage and contributing to a more sustainable driving experience.Extended Range: By using the energy that would otherwise be lost during braking as heat and sound, regenerative braking helps to extend the driving range of electric vehicles in instances such as travelling downhill. Reduced Brake Wear: Regenerative braking minimizes the strain on traditional braking components, mitigating wear and tear, and potentially extending the lifespan of the braking components such as brake pads, rotors and brake lines, thus reducing maintenance costs over time.Enhanced Driving Experience: Regenerative braking provides a smoother braking experience and a more responsive feel to drivers, enhancing overall driving comfort and control on the road.The disadvantages are listed below:Limited Effectiveness at Low Speeds: While regenerative braking efficiently recaptures energy during braking, its effectiveness diminishes at lower speeds which leads to decreased energy recovery compared to higher speeds.Complexity and Cost: Implementing regenerative braking adds complexity and cost to vehicle systems, potentially raising manufacturing and maintenance expenses, and impacting consumer affordability.Maintenance Requirements: Regenerative braking systems require periodic maintenance and calibration to ensure they operate optimally.Efficiency Variability: Regenerative braking may exhibit variability in efficiency under extreme weather conditions or on certain road surfaces, leading to fluctuations in overall energy recapture and impacting the vehicle’s efficiency.MisconceptionsFully Recharges Battery: Some mistakenly believe that regenerative braking fully replenishes the battery, but in reality, it only adds a modest amount of charge.Increases Braking Distances: There is a misconception that regenerative braking extends braking distances, but it enhances braking performance by complementing traditional brakes.High-Speed Only: While more effective at higher speeds, regenerative braking still functions at lower speeds, such as during city driving or stop-and-go traffic.Maintenance-Free: Despite requiring less maintenance than traditional brakes, regen braking systems still need periodic checks and maintenance to ensure proper operation.Significantly Boosts Range: While regen braking contributes to extending the driving range of electric vehicles, its impact is influenced by various factors beyond just braking efficiency.Only for Electric Cars: Although commonly associated with electric vehicles, regen braking systems are also found in some conventional vehicles, particularly those aiming to improve fuel efficiency with advanced technology.Photo: FreepikRegenerative braking might sound complicated, but it is pretty cool. Think of it as a way for EVs and hybrids to recycle energy when they slow down. Instead of just wasting that energy, regenerative braking turns it into electricity, which can then be used to power the battery.",['announc 17-member team asia cup'],"['regen brake represent imag .', 'photo : freepikth electr vehicl market nepal grown significantli past year .', 'electr four-wheel two-wheel launch almost everi month , span passeng commerci vehicl .', 'electr transport appear emerg trend automot industry.new ev regularli introduc advanc featur car compani develop uniqu electr platform .', 'one standout featur regen braking.regen brake first introduc 1967 american motor car compani ( amc ) prototyp electr vehicl , amc amitron .', 'howev , toyota becam automobil manufactur implement regen brake system ( rb ) technolog priu seri hybrid vehicl 1997 .', 'toyota brought new hybrid technolog priu fuel price go massiv rate .', '1997 toyota priu hybrid .', 'photo : toyotabut regen brake ?', 'still mani peopl confus , whether safe help fuel economi hybrid car regener electr electr cars.in simpl term , regen brake car save energi recharg batteri brake , help use less fuel electr go .', 'easi scientif , regen brake process use vehicl kinet energi produc brake convert electr energi electr motor act gener .', 'electr energi store vehicl ’ batteri later use , reduc energi wastag increas overal efficiency.photo : freepikregen brake seen kind ev , includ car , scooter , commerci van , buse , bicycl , three-wheel , rickshaw .', 'electr manag extent power brake gener .', 'regen brake work process evprincipl oper : regen brake work turn energi slow electricity.electr motor gener : ev hybrid car regen brake , motor chang role move car make electr brake.switch polar : brake , motor switch direct , turn energi wheel electr instead use move car.gener electr : turn wheel make motor produc electr , goe car ’ battery.pow electron : special electron chang electr motor right kind charg battery.batteri charg : electr made brake charg car ’ batteri , store energi later.integr hydraul brake system : regen brake work regular brake , blend smooth stopping.photo : automotive-iqadvantag disadvantag regen brake advantag list : energi effici : regen brake effici captur kinet energi gener brake , effect reduc energi wastag contribut sustain drive experience.extend rang : use energi would otherwis lost brake heat sound , regen brake help extend drive rang electr vehicl instanc travel downhil .', 'reduc brake wear : regen brake minim strain tradit brake compon , mitig wear tear , potenti extend lifespan brake compon brake pad , rotor brake line , thu reduc mainten cost time.enhanc drive experi : regen brake provid smoother brake experi respons feel driver , enhanc overal drive comfort control road.th disadvantag list : limit effect low speed : regen brake effici recaptur energi brake , effect diminish lower speed lead decreas energi recoveri compar higher speeds.complex cost : implement regen brake add complex cost vehicl system , potenti rais manufactur mainten expens , impact consum affordability.mainten requir : regen brake system requir period mainten calibr ensur oper optimally.effici variabl : regen brake may exhibit variabl effici extrem weather condit certain road surfac , lead fluctuat overal energi recaptur impact vehicl ’ efficiency.misconceptions recharg batteri : mistakenli believ regen brake fulli replenish batteri , realiti , add modest amount charge.increas brake distanc : misconcept regen brake extend brake distanc , enhanc brake perform complement tradit brakes.high-spe : effect higher speed , regen brake still function lower speed , citi drive stop-and-go traffic.maintenance-fre : despit requir less mainten tradit brake , regen brake system still need period check mainten ensur proper operation.significantli boost rang : regen brake contribut extend drive rang electr vehicl , impact influenc variou factor beyond brake efficiency.onli electr car : although commonli associ electr vehicl , regen brake system also found convent vehicl , particularli aim improv fuel effici advanc technology.photo : freepikregen brake might sound complic , pretti cool .', 'think way ev hybrid recycl energi slow .', 'instead wast energi , regen brake turn electr , use power batteri .']"
Machhindra qualify to face Mohun Bagan in 2nd preliminary round of the AFC Cup,"The snow leopard rescued from Urlabari is currently being kept at the Central Zoo in Lalitpur. Photo: Aryan DhimalAs the gates to the vet clinic at the Central Zoo in Lalitpur opened, more than two dozen photojournalists thronged the facility and surrounded a metal cage aiming their DSLR cameras at a snow leopard inside.“Please don’t come close to the animal,” the zoo’s vet, Radha Krishna Gharti, told approaching photojournalists. But in the gush of excitement to take exclusive photographs of the elusive cat, difficult to spot even in its prime habitats, there were few takers for the word of caution.Nepal’s Department of National Parks and Wildlife Conservation (DNPWC) organised the photo-op two days after the male subadult cat, which was until recently found in the country only at altitudes higher than 2,000-6,000 metres above sea level, was brought to the zoo from Urlabari town(146 m above sea level). According to the department, the animal has sustained injuries to its right foreleg and cannot stand upright.Although officials involved said they are looking at releasing the animal into the wild after it recuperates, doing so will be a daunting task, adding that the zoo may be the only place where it can now survive.Not a wild catReporters and photojournalists take photos of a snow leopard being held at the Central Zoo in Lalitpur, Nepal. Image by Abhaya Raj Joshi/ Mongabay“Nepali snow leopard experts have come up with two hypotheses to explain how the animal from the mountains landed up in the plains,” said Sharad Chandra Adhikari, member-secretary at the National Trust for Nature Conservation (NTNC), a semi-government body that manages the zoo in Lalitpur, a town in the Kathmandu Valley. The first of the two hypotheses made public during the photo-op-cum-press conference, is that it was raised in captivity and somehow managed to escape into the wild. The second is that it lost its orientation while trying to establish its territory after separating from its mother.Kulbhushansingh Suryawanshi, director of the India program, Snow Leopard Trust, said that both hypotheses are plausible explanations as to how the snow leopard got to the plains in Nepal.A DNPWC official, who wished to remain anonymous as he is not authorised to talk to the press, said that it was more likely that the animal had been raised in captivity. “The way it sipped the water and ate the food zoo staff offered indicates that it may have been raised in captivity,” the official said.Snow leopards are shy cats living at extreme altitudes in the steep mountainous areas of 12 countries in Central and South Asia. Their global population spread over altitudes of 500-5,800 m, is estimated to be between around 3,900 and 6,000 as detailed coordinated surveys of the population in the range countries are yet to be carried out. In Nepal, their population divided into three blocks (eastern, central and western) is estimated to be between 301 and 400.Adhikari from NTNC said that researchers will now examine the animal’s scat to analyse its diet and try to find out whether it was roaming in the wild or had been in some sort of captivity. Researchers are also preparing to analyse its genes to try to find out to which of the three metapopulations in Nepal it belongs. They will also observe the animal’s canine teeth and fur to look for clues.Relocation challenge A snow leopard found in Urlabari town in Nepal’s plains in a cage at the Central Zoo in Kathmandu. Photo: Aryan DhimalThe whole process could take a few months to complete, and summer could set in in Kathmandu by then, officials concede. “The current temperature in Kathmandu is suitable for snow leopards, as we are in the peak of winter,” said Madhu Chetri, a snow leopard researcher from NTNC. But that could change as spring season begins in the Northern Hemisphere.The DNPWC official said that regardless of the findings related to how the animal got to Urlabarli, the animal would have spent a significant amount of time with humans during its recovery phase. “That would mean that it would have gotten habituated with having humans around,” the official said.Sending such animals back into the wild is a challenge, as they may have lost their hunting and other adaptation skills, he added. In May last year, officials at the Chitwan National Park released two rescued rhino calves into the wild, with limited success. The safety of the animals, which had gotten used to having humans around, was compromised as poachers could easily approach and kill them. Eventually, they were transferred to an enclosure in eastern Nepal away from human intervention.Veteran conservationist Professor Karan Bahadur Shah said that rewilding the snow leopard would be a daunting task, as the animals are territorial. “If we just leave the animal in its natural habitat, it will get killed by other snow leopards defending their territory,” he said. “The best option would be to keep the animal in the zoo for the public to see.”But Nepal’s Central Zoo has its own set of problems. The facility, established in 1932 as a private collection, has limited space and has frequently run into financial trouble. Conservationists say the snow leopard would need special facilities to cater to its needs.“If the government decides that the snow leopard needs to remain at the zoo, we are ready to shoulder the responsibility,” said Adhikari. “We have set up special facilities for animals such as the red panda and chimpanzees,” he said. “We can do that for the snow leopard as well.”Those advocating for keeping the animal in the zoo also said that Nepal is a snow leopard range country and the public, especially the young generation, also needs to see the different animals found in the country. “It has great educational value,” said Shah.Snow leopard expert Suryawanshi from neighbouring India also said that it would be challenging to release the animal into the wild. “If the team at the zoo can establish the exact cause of this behaviour [why it ventured into the plains] and can keep the animal away from human contact, then it might be okay to release it back,” he said. “But otherwise, there is little hope for it in the wild. Better to let it live in the zoo.”Back at the zoo, after the photojournalists are done taking photos, it is the turn of the reporters to point their smartphones at the animal. Then there is a contingent of senior wildlife department officials waiting in line to catch a glimpse of the animal. “So much for keeping it away from human contact,” a conservationist observing the hullabaloo from a distance said.This story first appeared on Mongabay and Onlinekhabar is republishing it under a Creative Commons licence.",['machhindra qualifi face mohun bagan 2nd preliminari round afc cup'],"['snow leopard rescu urlabari current kept central zoo lalitpur .', 'photo : aryan dhimala gate vet clinic central zoo lalitpur open , two dozen photojournalist throng facil surround metal cage aim dslr camera snow leopard insid . “ pleas ’ come close anim , ” zoo ’ vet , radha krishna gharti , told approach photojournalist .', 'gush excit take exclus photograph elus cat , difficult spot even prime habitat , taker word caution.nep ’ depart nation park wildlif conserv ( dnpwc ) organis photo-op two day male subadult cat , recent found countri altitud higher 2,000-6,000 metr sea level , brought zoo urlabari town ( 146 sea level ) .', 'accord depart , anim sustain injuri right foreleg stand upright.although offici involv said look releas anim wild recuper , daunt task , ad zoo may place survive.not wild catreport photojournalist take photo snow leopard held central zoo lalitpur , nepal .', 'imag abhaya raj joshi/ mongabay “ nepali snow leopard expert come two hypothes explain anim mountain land plain , ” said sharad chandra adhikari , member-secretari nation trust natur conserv ( ntnc ) , semi-govern bodi manag zoo lalitpur , town kathmandu valley .', 'first two hypothes made public photo-op-cum-press confer , rais captiv somehow manag escap wild .', 'second lost orient tri establish territori separ mother.kulbhushansingh suryawanshi , director india program , snow leopard trust , said hypothes plausibl explan snow leopard got plain nepal.a dnpwc offici , wish remain anonym authoris talk press , said like anim rais captiv .', '“ way sip water ate food zoo staff offer indic may rais captiv , ” offici said.snow leopard shi cat live extrem altitud steep mountain area 12 countri central south asia .', 'global popul spread altitud 500-5,800 , estim around 3,900 6,000 detail coordin survey popul rang countri yet carri .', 'nepal , popul divid three block ( eastern , central western ) estim 301 400.adhikari ntnc said research examin anim ’ scat analys diet tri find whether roam wild sort captiv .', 'research also prepar analys gene tri find three metapopul nepal belong .', 'also observ anim ’ canin teeth fur look clues.reloc challeng snow leopard found urlabari town nepal ’ plain cage central zoo kathmandu .', 'photo : aryan dhimalth whole process could take month complet , summer could set kathmandu , offici conced .', '“ current temperatur kathmandu suitabl snow leopard , peak winter , ” said madhu chetri , snow leopard research ntnc .', 'could chang spring season begin northern hemisphere.th dnpwc offici said regardless find relat anim got urlabarli , anim would spent signific amount time human recoveri phase .', '“ would mean would gotten habitu human around , ” offici said.send anim back wild challeng , may lost hunt adapt skill , ad .', 'may last year , offici chitwan nation park releas two rescu rhino calv wild , limit success .', 'safeti anim , gotten use human around , compromis poacher could easili approach kill .', 'eventu , transfer enclosur eastern nepal away human intervention.veteran conservationist professor karan bahadur shah said rewild snow leopard would daunt task , anim territori .', '“ leav anim natur habitat , get kill snow leopard defend territori , ” said .', '“ best option would keep anim zoo public see . ” nepal ’ central zoo set problem .', 'facil , establish 1932 privat collect , limit space frequent run financi troubl .', 'conservationist say snow leopard would need special facil cater need . “ govern decid snow leopard need remain zoo , readi shoulder respons , ” said adhikari .', '“ set special facil anim red panda chimpanze , ” said .', '“ snow leopard well . ” advoc keep anim zoo also said nepal snow leopard rang countri public , especi young gener , also need see differ anim found countri .', '“ great educ valu , ” said shah.snow leopard expert suryawanshi neighbour india also said would challeng releas anim wild .', '“ team zoo establish exact caus behaviour [ ventur plain ] keep anim away human contact , might okay releas back , ” said .', '“ otherwis , littl hope wild .', 'better let live zoo . ” back zoo , photojournalist done take photo , turn report point smartphon anim .', 'conting senior wildlif depart offici wait line catch glimps anim .', '“ much keep away human contact , ” conservationist observ hullabaloo distanc said.thi stori first appear mongabay onlinekhabar republish creativ common licenc .']"
Nepal to take on Myanmar before FIFA World Cup Qualifier.,"The National Assembly was formed to give experienced people a chance to be part of the parliament and help during the formation of important bills. In countries that follow the Westminster model of government, the upper house plays an important role. That, however, is not the case in Nepal as the country’s upper house has become a platform where individuals secure positions in the National Assembly based on their connections. As the election nears, many once again question the relevance and existence of the upper house.Things were different in the past as the initial years of the National Assembly saw experienced politicians and experts others in their field be nominated for the post. That slowly changed as the first batch completed its two-year term.“I understand why people are frustrated with the upper house. People expected experts but all we got was party cadres who lacked knowledge or experience,” says Bimala Rai Paudyal a National Assembly member. “Considering such behaviour and practices, what distinguishes the House of Representatives from the National Assembly?”A loser’s second chance Narayan Kaji Shrestha, who faced defeat in the 2017 general election from Gorkha-2, was elected as a member of the National Assembly on January 23, 2020. Elected from Gandaki Province, Shrestha currently is the Deputy Prime Minister and Home Minister of the country.Bhagwati Neupane who lost the election from Gandaki province and Bimala Ghimire who lost the election for mayorship in Bhanu Municipality also shared the same trajectory.Similarly, Mrigendra Kumar Singh Yadav and Jag Prasad Sharma were defeated in the House of Representatives elections, from Saptari-4 and Dang-3 respectively are now members of the National Assembly. Bam Dev Gautam, who lost the elections from Bardiya, secured a place in the upper house through nomination by President Bidya Devi Bhandari.Even those who did not win as ward member(s) got the opportunity to become members of the National Assembly including Sindh Bahadur Bishwakarma who was appointed on February 7, 2018. He is soon leaving his post on March 3.Despite the repeated criticisms, the political parties have not paid attention to this concern posed by political leaders and the general public. The latest proof of this is the list of candidates for the National Assembly elections scheduled on January 25. The list contains names like Krishna Prasad Sitaula, defeated in the House of Representatives elections in 2022 from Koshi Province, and Pooja Chaudhary, who lost in the provincial assembly elections 2022 from Rautahat-3 (a).Speaker Ganesh Prasad Timilsina, who led the National Assembly for the entire six years under the federal system, is also dissatisfied with the individuals who have made it to the upper house. “The allegations are something for the parties to ponder upon. The leaders should have prioritised involving intellectuals/neutrals rather than managing its members,” he says.The 59-member National Assembly elects eight representatives, equally from all seven provinces, with an additional three individuals nominated by the President. The Constitution ensures representation of women, Dalits, minorities or disabled communities, envisioning that experts, experienced individuals, and the most qualified people from various fields will become members of the National Assembly.Easy way inFile: A National Assembly meetingThere are some reasons why leaders aspire to join the upper house, and even the leadership create opportunities for them. In National Assembly elections, voters consist of local-level heads/deputy heads and provincial assembly members. Typically, individuals seeking these positions undergo a vetting process by their respective parties. As a result, aspiring members of parliament can focus less on persuading individual voters and more on gaining party support to secure their candidacy. Moreover, being a member of the National Assembly opens avenues to ministerial roles. The constitution prohibits a National Assembly member from becoming the Prime Minister, but not Deputy Prime Minister. Due to such opportunities, leaders are enticed to seek a position in the assembly.The National Assembly is currently in its fourth election cycle since the promulgation of the Consitution in 2015. Scheduled for January 25, this election aims to fill 19 seats vacated by individuals completing their six-year terms. The previous election cycles took place in 2017, involving 56 members, followed by 2019 with 18 positions, and 2020 with 19 positions.The cascading impactsFile: A National Assembly meetingAnother reason why the National Assembly is finding it difficult to justify itself is that it has become a shadow of the House of Representatives. The meeting of the National Assembly did not have one session when the House of Representatives was dissolved by then Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli twice. The demands and issues raised by the opposition parties in the House of Representatives automatically went to the National Assembly, where the parliamentarians of the ruling party put forward any proposal, they endorse it the same as in the House of Representatives.The latest example – is the main opposition UML did not allow the meeting of the House of Representatives to continue for five days from July 5, 2023, due to a statement made by Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal during his visit to India. Consequently, the meeting of the National Assembly was also paused during that period.The UML obstructed the House of Representatives for almost a month starting mid-July last year demanding a high-level inquiry committee to probe the 60-kilogram gold smuggling case and the resignation of the Home Minister. The National Assembly followed suit with leaders pushing their agendas forward.Speaker Ganesh Timilsina himself is dissatisfied that every behaviour and activity of the House of Representatives influence the National Assembly. He says despite his attempts to prevent the overshadowing, it has been unfortunate that he did not garner the goodwill of the top leaders during political disputes.Reinstating powerThe National Assembly is a permanent institution. Therefore, it can remain operational even in the absence of the House of Representatives. Under normal circumstances, Speaker Timilsina initiated a positive practice by personally participating in different committees. Nevertheless, in the absence of the House of Representatives, the National Assembly often experienced inactivity.In December 2020, the Prime Minister at that time, KP Sharma Oli, dissolved the House of Representatives. Subsequently, a session of the National Assembly was convened on January 1, 2021. Despite lasting only seven hours over four days, this session, which took place after the dissolution, failed to address crucial public issues. Even after six months, important matters remained unaddressed within the House.On May 22, 2021, the UML-led government once again dissolved the House of Representatives. The meeting of the National Assembly and committees was affected once more. However, the dissolutions were declared unconstitutional by the Supreme Court, reinstating the parliament.The Constitution says that despite the closing of the National Assembly session, thematic committee meetings can still take place. However, both the National Assembly and its committees remained inactive until the restoration of the House of Representatives.According to Khimlal Devkota, a member of the National Assembly, when the House of Representatives was dissolved twice, it seemed that the National Assembly was also in a state of dissolution.Bimala Rai Paudyal also believes that the inability to resume the upper house is a mark of weakness. “Since the government was not in a position to call, the President needed to be consulted by the chair together with the consultation committee. That was not done either,” she says.Constitutional and legal distinctionsExcept for the Constitution of Nepal (1962) and the Interim Constitution of Nepal (2007), all other constitutions in Nepal provided for a bicameral parliament with the National Assembly or the Upper House and the House of Representatives or the Lower House. The practices before 2015 were under the unitary governance system, but after the adoption of the federal democratic republican governance system, the role of the National Assembly has changed somewhat.In the preamble of the constitution prepared by the ‘Constituent Assembly, and Administrative Organ Designation Committee’ during the drafting of the constitution, it is mentioned that some different qualifications have been prescribed for being a member of the House of Representatives and the National Assembly, with the intention that qualified people can be represented in the National Assembly.Chair of the National Assembly Ganesh Prasad Timilsina restates that the members of the upper house should be assessed based on the country’s expectations with clear criteria. There is no definite definition of an expert in the constitution. It has been stated symbolically, “…It is expected that the members should have some basic skills to face the challenges and fulfil their responsibilities.”According to the constitution, the responsibility of the National Assembly is to correctly establish the rights of the local level, state, and union, and to prevent the House of Representatives from trying to enact laws contrary to the spirit of federalism. There is an explanatory comment in the constitution about the propriety of the National Assembly – “This House is expected to fulfil its role to maintain creative and mutual relations between the national government and the provinces.”In addition, there are some constitutional and legal differences regarding the National Assembly. But the MPs are demanding that it should cease. When a bill originating in the House of Representatives is passed and sent to the National Assembly, and if the latter does not decide within 60 days, it proceeds de facto.This has placed the National Assembly in a dilemma. The Chairman of the National Assembly, Timilsina, says, “Such an arrangement should also apply to the House of Representatives, or both should be equal.”Need for course correction PM Pushpa Kamal Dahal speaking in the National Assembly meeting.Some instances have turned these so-called experts into a laughing stock due to their actions. On July 5, 2023,  a discussion on the Electronic Commerce (E-Commerce) Bill 2023 was tabled in the National Assembly. However, the parliamentarians misunderstood the main point and instead discussed the matter of electricity. The MPs, who had not read the proposal, suggested that electricity consumption within Nepal should also be increased besides exporting electricity to India and Bangladesh.During the meeting, Ramesh Rijal, the Minister of Industry, Commerce and Supplies, also mentioned that India would purchase electricity during the Prime Minister’s visit. Unfortunately, the bill was unanimously approved.Timilsina considers the incident an example, that in his six-year tenure, he does not want to remember. Som Bahadur Thapa, a former secretary at the Parliament Secretariat, termed the incident ‘a joke’ in the Parliament of Nepal. “This is strong proof of the kind of MPs we have, who speak without knowing what they are talking about.” Timilsina assumed the role of the speaker/chair of the National Assembly after the establishment of the Federal Democratic Republic. He had the opportunity to establish the system and the dignity of the National Assembly. However, instead of setting a positive example, he will soon be retiring after being accused of playing tricks with the Speaker and showing interest in the work of the House of Representatives.Timilsina has repeatedly commented on the affairs of the House of Representatives. The latest instance was during a seminar on ‘Japan: Past, Present, and Future’ held in the capital on December 2, 2023, he publicly stated that the election results of the House of Representatives did not bode well.Pointing to the emergence of a new party and the victory of some independent candidates, he said, “In a democracy, you get to choose candidates, irrespective of their party affiliation. However, is the signal positive?”In August/ September 2022, Timilsina wrote a letter to the Election Commission, urging them to extend the tenure of Speaker and Deputy Speaker. Upon receiving a response stating that the Commission would not determine the tenure of the elected Parliament, Timilsina directed the Parliament Secretariat not to execute decisions made by the Management Committee after September 17, 2022.This created conflict between the Speaker of the House of Representatives and the Speaker of the National Assembly and in the crux of this dispute between the parties, the country had to bear the consequences of this conflict. Laws could not be enacted promptly, and the place once considered the domain of experts was overshadowed by the party’s interest. A study conducted by the Democracy Resource Center Nepal (DRCN) on the legislative functioning of the National Assembly has revealed that the Upper House has passed some bills that go against the spirit of federalism.The report’s concluding remarks say, “…the bills passed by the House of Representatives have not undergone significant changes or discussions in the National Assembly. The conclusion section of the study states that – “Furthermore, some bills, contradicting the spirit of federalism and addressing the interests of interest groups, have been approved by the National Assembly.”Overall, in the last six years, parties have introduced individuals who, given their presentation level, have raised questions about the National Assembly’s justification. If there are no changes in the constitution, laws, and policies concerning the upper assembly, these concerns will persist.”",['nepal take myanmar fifa world cup qualifi .'],"['nation assembl form

Gyanendra Malla: The last pillar of Nepal’s golden generation bids farewell,"Representational image Photo by Tanushree Rao on UnsplashWhile most of the nation was preparing for the festival of lights, Tihar in early November 2023, something no less exciting was fuelling our sparks from oceans away. A queer art festival was happening for the seventeenth year and we had a chance to attend it as delegates. Our delegation was made possible through the collaboration between the Outburst Arts, an art organisation based in Northern Ireland, UK and the British Council, Nepal.There is a clear distinction between cities in terms of their flourishing arts scenes, and this became apparent during a visit to Belfast, Northern Ireland, specifically for the Outburst Queer Arts Festival held in the charming city centre. The organisation of such a festival requires months of careful preparation and planning.The queer art festival started as short events lasting a few days. Now, after 17 years, it has grown into a ten-day festival with panel discussions, theatre performances, and exhibitions. Program guides were available at venues, partner hotels, local libraries, and shops. Many delegates, including us, came from outside Northern Ireland to attend.During the queer art festival, we had the opportunity to connect with art curators, publishers, artists, and representatives from other British Council departments around the world (Lithuania, France, South Africa, Turkey, Greece, Jordan, England, and Argentina to name a few.) Each event that we attended gave us a different insight into what the arts can do and how it can facilitate connections. We gained insights from queer publishers and art curators on the challenges they face in their own countries due to resources and sometimes from bureaucracy in systems. We also got to see the way people can thrive when given a platform to showcase their works, such as an art exhibition in which the artist reimagined intimacy for queer people.On the other hand, Nepal struggles by and large at times for queer visibility. There are no explicit spaces for SOGIESC (Sexual Orientation, Gender Identity and Expressions and Sex Characteristics) artists to showcase their works nor openly come together as a community, it all exists in pocket spaces. In the same way, something that struck us was the presence of older queer artists at the festival. It was not just for one particular event during the queer art festival. We noticed an active participation and involvement of older queer people throughout the festival there. It was fascinating to see queer artists in their 40s and 50s share their transformative and inspiring work. Whereas, back home, the queer folks at the forefront of queer art, advocacy and activism are mostly Gen-Zs and millennials. We have very few queer elders that we can count on our fingers who are diligently working for Nepali queer folks. Even among them, some still hold onto archaic notions and refuse to evolve and embrace changes. So, there’s that.From dream to realityDuring the queer art festival, we had the opportunity to connect with art curators, publishers and artists. Photo by Raphael Renter | @raphi_rawr on UnsplashBefore being selected as delegates, both of us joined online meetings with British Council Nepal and the Outburst representatives facilitated through Kaalo 101 (an art space in Patan), along with interested queer artists from Nepal. We had a total of three meetings where we discussed the possibilities and challenges of doing a queer art festival in Nepal. The discourse also entailed us sharing a presentation about the updates of the queer art scene in Nepal in the last five years. The updates included memorable leaps taken in queer arts from music to literature and fashion and more by artists from diverse walks of life. Days after the third meeting, the British Council extended invitations to us to attend the Outburst Queer Arts Festival.Our delegation is just one example of the transcontinental collaboration because it was something that happened for the first time and involved us. But, Outburst Arts and the British Council have been practising cross-continental collaboration for years. Even in this year’s festival, we witnessed a lot of artists from different continents work together in exhibitions, lectures, panel discussions, magazines and so on. The amalgamation introduced us to brilliant thought-provoking work that defies gender and sociopolitical norms. The power of transcontinental collaboration was beyond beautiful.Imagining queer arts in NepalPhoto by Nikolas Gannon on UnsplashThe queer art scene in Nepal is an emerging one. While a full-fledged festival may not be possible now, something small yet significant is achievable. Time and again, different organisations have been running large art exhibitions/tours for weeks and months. However, in the microcosm that is Nepal, especially Kathmandu, the capital is no stranger to art-oriented programs. What it has been unfamiliar with precisely is queer art. And the unfamiliarity is not something induced by the lack of queer artists and their art. Sadly, it is because of inadequate platforms, space and resources to pursue queer arts.Despite this, through the years there have been events and literature that have emerged centring on queer identity, but it has not come without its challenges. On collections of stories, “Pride Climbing Higher” and “Songs of Revolution” showcase stories from Nepalis across Nepal. There are not many stories reflecting the Nepali queer experiences otherwise. June Pride Parade by Queer Youth Group has gained momentum as well in the past few years since its conception, from a small gathering to now a large parade with performances from community members. The same can be said about Blue Diamond Society’s (BDS) Rainbow Visibility Pride events in August during the festival of Saa-Paru (Gai Jatra) which has been running for well over a decade; in recent years they have included flash mobs and interaction programmes as well in lead up to their parade. Individuals within the community have also organised their queer gatherings with friends, thus coming back to the cosmos of pocket spaces in celebrating queerness.While artists like us are creative with what we want to put out, we still need organisations like the British Council to foster spaces and connections to enable us to do that. Then and again, artists have come together and collaborated on queer-centric projects. But, we need funding and resources to achieve bigger-scale projects that unite more artists and transcend borders.Both of us advocate for queer rights and are involved in programs and activities that push the narrative further, extend the visibility of the community and normalise conversations surrounding queerness. Among other things, we are also the founders of Queering The Bond, a networking collective for Nepali queer folks and Shuby is also the founder of Queer Honky-Tonk, a platform to promote queer performances and networking with events such as a drag show or open mic every few months. However, both of us, individually or collaboratively can only do so much. The challenges of living in a capitalistic world oftentimes outweigh the passion we have for the queer art scene in Nepal. And this is where we expect the government and organisations to step up with policies, platforms and programs to provide spaces, opportunities and resources for queer artists. Here, the British Council joined hands with Outburst Arts, which paved the way for our delegation. We would not have known about the marvellous queer art festival at the other end of the world otherwise.Besides the limitations brought by insufficient spaces and social unawareness, the centralised capital does hinder queer artists from outside the city to connect, create and collaborate. Art already is centralised and elitist. On top of that, the concentrated Kathmandu Valley is of no help when it comes to making art accessible beyond its borders.Furthermore, there is also the expectation from basically everyone to have the perfect festival that caters to all people’s needs and wants. While the festival, if it should happen, is bound to be done with the right intentions, there is a lot of pressure for the first-time event itself. The festival will be inclusive and diverse. But, realistically speaking, it would be a struggle to make it relevant to each queer person from east to west.Speaking of struggles, a visceral feeling of uneasiness swarmed over me with each step I took while exiting the airport after the flight back home. I, Birat, personally felt that I could not be as free or unrestrained in Nepal as I was during my time in Belfast. No wonder a lot of the queer people we know opt for abroad.Seventeen years ago, when the Outburst Queer Arts Festival first began, it certainly was not as celebrated or large as it is now. What we are trying to convey here is that we do not have to start big. We can aim for something small yet promising. While there might be expectations to check all the boxes, it is crucial to be mindful of our capacity as well. But, we can be capacitated and this is where you – people in power, art enthusiasts, grant and resource allocators and media come in. It is time we all believe in Nepali queer art and create space for it to not only survive but thrive. It is imperative to understand that formulating our imagination into reality can only be possible through unwavering collaboration.",['gyanendra malla : last pillar nepal ’ golden gener bid farewel'],"['represent imag photo tanushre rao unsplashwhil nation prepar festiv light , tihar earli novemb 2023 , someth less excit fuell spark ocean away .', 'queer art festiv happen seventeenth year chanc attend deleg .', 'deleg made possibl collabor outburst art , art organis base northern ireland , uk british council , nepal.ther clear distinct citi term flourish art scene , becam appar visit belfast , northern ireland , specif outburst queer art festiv held charm citi centr .', 'organis festiv requir month care prepar planning.th queer art festiv start short event last day .', ', 17 year , grown ten-day festiv panel discuss , theatr perform , exhibit .', 'program guid avail venu , partner hotel , local librari , shop .', 'mani deleg , includ us , came outsid northern ireland attend.dur queer art festiv , opportun connect art curat , publish , artist , repres british council depart around world ( lithuania , franc , south africa , turkey , greec , jordan , england , argentina name . )', 'event attend gave us differ insight art facilit connect .', 'gain insight queer publish art curat challeng face countri due resourc sometim bureaucraci system .', 'also got see way peopl thrive given platform showcas work , art exhibit artist reimagin intimaci queer people.on hand , nepal struggl larg time queer visibl .', 'explicit space sogiesc ( sexual orient , gender ident express sex characterist ) artist showcas work openli come togeth commun , exist pocket space .', 'way , someth struck us presenc older queer artist festiv .', 'one particular event queer art festiv .', 'notic activ particip involv older queer peopl throughout festiv .', 'fascin see queer artist 40 50 share transform inspir work .', 'wherea , back home , queer folk forefront queer art , advocaci activ mostli gen-z millenni .', 'queer elder count finger dilig work nepali queer folk .', 'even among , still hold onto archaic notion refus evolv embrac chang .', ', ’ that.from dream realitydur queer art festiv , opportun connect art curat , publish artist .', 'photo raphael renter | @ raphi_rawr unsplashbefor select deleg , us join onlin meet british council nepal outburst repres facilit kaalo 101 ( art space patan ) , along interest queer artist nepal .', 'total three meet discuss possibl challeng queer art festiv nepal .', 'discours also entail us share present updat queer art scene nepal last five year .', 'updat includ memor leap taken queer art music literatur fashion artist divers walk life .', 'day third meet , british council extend invit us attend outburst queer art festival.our deleg one exampl transcontinent collabor someth happen first time involv us .', ', outburst art british council practis cross-continent collabor year .', 'even year ’ festiv , wit lot artist differ contin work togeth exhibit , lectur , panel discuss , magazin .', 'amalgam introduc us brilliant thought-provok work defi gender sociopolit norm .', 'power transcontinent collabor beyond beautiful.imagin queer art nepalphoto nikola gannon unsplashth queer art scene nepal emerg one .', 'full-fledg festiv may possibl , someth small yet signific achiev .', 'time , differ organis run larg art exhibitions/tour week month .', 'howev , microcosm nepal , especi kathmandu , capit stranger art-ori program .', 'unfamiliar precis queer art .', 'unfamiliar someth induc lack queer artist art .', 'sadli , inadequ platform , space resourc pursu queer arts.despit , year event literatur emerg centr queer ident , come without challeng .', 'collect stori , “ pride climb higher ” “ song revolut ” showcas stori nepali across nepal .', 'mani stori reflect nepali queer experi otherwis .', 'june pride parad queer youth group gain momentum well past year sinc concept , small gather larg parad perform commun member .', 'said blue diamond societi ’ ( bd ) rainbow visibl pride event august festiv saa-paru ( gai jatra ) run well decad ;

Posts navigation,"The month of January saw major road accidents in different parts of the country, including Lamhi in Dang, Dhorpatan in Baglung, and Chandragiri in Kathmandu. Road accidents have been common throughout the country with Nepal Police data suggesting over 2,500 people dying in them annually. Despite this, the Ministry of Finance has shown reluctance to introduce the proposed Road Safety Bill to reduce traffic accidents, fatalities, and serious injuries, and enhance road safety. Instead, the Finance Ministry has asked the Ministry of Physical Infrastructure and Transport to include the proposed bill in the Public Roads Act. Along with that, the government’s initiative to pass dedicated laws on road safety and set up a mechanism, including the empowered National Road Safety Council (NRSC), to decrease accidents, has come to a halt.Keshav Kumar Sharma, secretary of the Ministry of Physical Infrastructure and Transport, says they asked for a dedicated road safety law that comprehensively addresses institutional arrangements was the need of the hour. This includes ensuring safety in road construction, promoting public awareness, providing training and communication facilities, implementing rescue mechanisms, and arranging rehabilitation for families affected by road accidents. However, the Ministry of Finance believes a separate law is unnecessary due to concerns about potential increased financial burden.Hourly needOfficials from the Ministry of Physical Infrastructure allege that the Ministry of Finance is approaching sensitive matters, such as passenger safety, solely from an economic standpoint. They say that concerns related to road, vehicle, and passenger safety are being overshadowed, and there are indications that this approach will continue. “The government is avoiding addressing the sensitive issue of road accidents and the associated human and material costs, fearing an increase in expenses. This contradicts the government’s commitment and policy to reduce traffic accidents in the future,” says an official from the Ministry of Physical Infrastructure on the condition of anonymity.According to the Ministry of Physical Infrastructure, the existing laws lack the vision and purpose necessary for developing a sustainable, safe, risk-free, and reliable transportation operation and security system. Therefore, the Ministry of Physical Infrastructure officials argue that a distinct law is essential to decrease road accidents and ensure the safety of pedestrians, including passenger transport workers and roadside residents, as well as pets, wild animals, and birds. “The Road Safety Act is the need of the hour as it will help us during post-accident rescue, treatment management, rehabilitation, and legal representation,” says the official.Currently, there are gaps in enforcing road rules, monitoring vehicle capacities, ensuring road structure safety, managing traffic signs, and organizing road safety facilities. The implementation of the Road Safety Act is seen as crucial to address these issues.However, there has not been a facilitative environment for providing education and raising awareness about road traffic safety, safety mechanisms, and coordinating among organisations related to road transport. The aspect of training drivers with skills and knowledge, as well as monitoring road safety on the roads, is also lacking. This is why experts have been suggesting introducing a separate road safety law to address these aspects.The Finance Ministry, however, says that road safety should not be downplayed by ignoring human sensibilities related to road safety and citing economic reasons. Officials from the Ministry of Physical Infrastructure argue that incorporating safety considerations in the Road Act does not automatically result in a decrease in accidents or the integration of post-accident rescue, relief, and rehabilitation efforts.“The existing laws do not address road safety anywhere. Due to its lack of clarity and inadequacy, it has not been implemented with due diligence. For instance, provisions such as those for vehicle inspectors outlined in the Transport Act have not been acted upon by the government,” says an official from the Transport Ministry.Policies and commitments, but no lawsThe Motor Vehicles and Transport Management Act (1993) includes several provisions related to vehicle registration, road permits, driver’s licenses, traffic management, insurance, and penalties. The Public Roads Act (1974) primarily focuses on road management. However, there is no provision in the Act regarding the National Road Safety Council.In this situation, Nepal has developed a 10-year road safety action plan but is yet to enact corresponding legislation. Unfortunately, government agencies and mechanisms are not obligated to follow the action plan, as it lacks legal guidance.Now, the Transport Ministry holds the view that if safety considerations are explicitly addressed in the Public Roads Act, the outcome will not differ from what the Finance Ministry has said. Given the Public Roads Act’s close association with the Department of Road, the ministry thinks greater emphasis will be placed on road construction. However, they argue that incorporating the road safety aspect into the Act would not be effective.Secretary Sharma of the Transport Ministry is tasked with ensuring road safety, overseeing physical infrastructure and transport, and coordinating efforts across education, health, home, law, federal affairs, and general administration ministries. This responsibility extends to provincial ministries, local levels, as well as various agencies, organisations, security agencies, non-governmental organisations, and related entities, each with their specific roles.“As all the agencies need to be allocated responsibilities for various aspects of road safety, we have requested them to collaborate in formulating a distinct law. This should encompass the reduction of all types of accidents,” said Sharma.The ministry believes that a dedicated law addressing road safety is crucial to mitigate severe road accidents in Nepal and to uphold the commitments made by the country on the international stage.Nepal has committed to implementing the Stockholm Declaration through the Global Road Traffic Safety Conference in 2020, as per the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. Nepal, which has incorporated sustainable development goals into its national development plan, has not yet commenced work aligned with these objectives.Nevertheless, Nepal’s neighbouring countries are already addressing road safety through legal frameworks. Various states in India have enacted road safety laws, and the effectiveness of these laws is contributing to a 50 per cent reduction in road accidents.In 1999, Bhutan also introduced a unified road safety and transport act. Pakistan, on the other hand, issued the National Highway Safety Ordinance-2000 to ensure road safety, distinct from its National Highway Authority Act (1991). Britain, Australia, America, New Zealand, and other countries have established separate road safety laws as well.Road safety neglectedIn Nepal, road safety has been consistently neglected due to the absence of dedicated legislation. Road safety expert Keshav Adhikari says that the government primarily focused on road construction, overlooks crucial aspects such as road safety and reinforcement. Consequently, roads are transforming into perilous pathways for both vehicles and passengers.“There is a lack of interest in formulating policies and laws aimed at mitigating financial losses resulting from accidents,” says Adhikari.He further points out that safety is not a governmental priority, as expanding the road network is perceived to yield more political benefits than implementing additional structures to enhance road safety.“When I worked as an expert in the Transport Ministry for over a year, I realised that promoting road safety is not a government priority,” he says. “Annually, more people die due to road accidents than those who die in natural disasters, but the government has not given it much attention.”Even though the prime minister, ministers, and MPs keep asserting that roads have been constructed, no one seems to be addressing the critical issues of road safety and quality.Saroj Sitaula, General Secretary of the Federation of Nepalese National Transport Entrepreneurs (FNNTE), says that the government must be attentive as accidents are on the rise due to various technical and human factors, including road infrastructure. “Many accidents can be mitigated by improving road conditions, installing barriers on the sides, putting up informational boards, and ensuring scientific and practical road markings,” he says. “We need to formulate a plan and progress accordingly.”Sitaula argues that the government should establish policies to create mechanisms for emergency rescue, treatment, and rehabilitation after an accident occurs. He emphasises the importance of enhancing road infrastructure, conducting a scientific examination of the technical condition of vehicles, and ensuring compliance with the law by drivers, passengers, and regulators. He says that blaming drivers and transport entrepreneurs for accidents is inadequate, and the government must fulfil its responsibilities.Roads are unsafeNepal currently boasts a road network spanning approximately 100,000 km, with the majority consisting of dirt and gravel roads. Among the more than 22,000 kilometres of national and subsidiary highways, numerous sections remain unpaved.Despite the government’s substantial investment in road construction and expansion, minimal efforts are allocated to ensuring road safety. Recently, all three levels of government have accelerated the widening of roads, incorporating asphalt and slopes. However, it appears that issues concerning road quality and safety are escalating at a faster pace. Roads that have been neglected in the guise of maintenance have become a nightmare for the public.Infrastructure expert Suryaraj Acharya notes that these problems arise due to the tendency to construct roads only after they have sustained damage, without considering potential issues during the initial construction phase.",['post navig'],"['month januari saw major road accid differ part

Priyam Pradhan explores the essence of money and life in ‘Mani’ ,"Realme 12 Pro+ 5G. Photo: Realme IndiaRealme has launched its popular mid-range number series smartphone, the Realme 12 Pro series. The series includes the Realme 12 Pro 5G and the Realme 12 Pro+ 5G which are the successors of the Realme 11 Pro+ 5G and Realme 11 Pro 5G respectively. The Realme 11 series was widely appreciated for its design and performance at the price range. The 12 series has stepped up the game with an even better design. Realme has not only changed the design but has also upgraded the performance and the camera to compete in the mid-range price market. Realme recently has been focusing a lot on the design aspect and the price range performance. The 12 Pro+ has some major differences from last year’s 11 Pro+ which include design, IP rating, chipset, camera and charging. Let us see what the luxuriously designed smartphone delivers in terms of specs.Specifications of Realme 12 Pro+ 5GDimensionsLength: 161.47mmWidth: 74.02mmDepth: 8.75mmWeight196 gramsDisplay typeAMOLEDDisplay size6.7-inchResolution2,412 x 1,080 (FHD+)Refresh rateUp to 120HzIP ratingIP65 dust and water resistance Glass Protection0.55mm Double-Reinforced GlassChipsetSnapdragon 7s Gen 2 (4nm)CPUOcta-core (4×2.40 GHz Cortex-A78 & 4×1.95 GHz Cortex-A55)GPUAdreno 710OSRealme UI 5.0 based on Android 14RAM8GB | 12GBStorage128GB | 256GBRear camera 50MP Sony IMX890 main camera8MP ultra-wide camera64MP periscope portrait cameraSelfie camera32MP Wi-Fi802.11 a/b/g/n/ac/ax（Wi-Fi 6）Bluetooth5.2NetworkLTE | 5GSIMDual Nano SIMAudioDual SpeakersSupports Dolby AtmosDual-mic Noise CancellationHi-Res Audio CertificationSensorsGeomagnetic sensor, Proximity sensor, Light sensor, Acceleration sensor, Gyroscope, In-display fingerprint sensorBattery5,000mAh (typ)Charging67W SUPERVOOC wired fast chargingPorts and Buttons2 Nano SIM Card SlotsType-C PortPower ButtonVolume ButtonsColoursSubmarine BlueNavigator BeigeExplorer RedPrice (expected)Rs 50,000 (8/128GB)Rs 54,000 (8/256GB)Rs 60,000 (12/256GB)Design and DisplayThe Realme 12 Pro+ and the Realme 12 Pro share the same design and dimensions. The design is fascinating. Realme patterned up with Luxury Swiss Watch designer Ollivier Savéo to craftfully design the smartphone. All the colour options have a vegan leather back. Since the phone is designed by a luxury watch designer, it comes with a big round camera module housing the triple camera setup. There is a golden 3D Jubilee Bracelet which gives the texture of a luxury watch strap. A golden patterned line runs through the middle and around the camera module for an even better look.Realme 12 Pro+ 5G designer Ollivier Savéo.

On the front, the 12 Pro+ 5G has a curved screen with a centred hole-punch cutout which houses the selfie camera. The bezels are minimal with the sides being curved almost zero while the top and the chin have a slight ear-like bezel.

Photo: Realme IndiaPerformance and StorageThe performance has also been stepped up with the change from MediaTek Chipset in the 11 Pro series to Snapdragon chipsets in the 12 Pro series. The Realme 12 Pro+ 5G is powered by the Snapdragon 7s Gen 2 chipset built on a 4nm processor. It has an octa-core CPU, which includes Cortex-A78 and Cortex-A55 cores for seamless multitasking and responsiveness. The Adreno 710 GPU handles the graphics for gaming and multimedia.

The overall software experience is good but Realme gets back to the cost-cutting techniques in the software part with a bunch load of pre-installed hot apps and hot games. It also has a 3D VC liquid cooling system which spans 3394mm² and covers the main heat sources of the motherboard giving a boost in heat dissipation efficiency.Photo: Realme IndiaThe Realme 12 Pro+ 5G is available in two RAM options which include 8GB and 12GB.

He has also won an Academy Award for Best Cinematography for his role in Life of Pi in 2013. Claudio Miranda has worked with Realme for fine-tuning images. There are also three film filters made in collaboration with Claudio Miranda with unique colour grading matched with a 2.39:1 aspect ratio and cinematic-level bokeh adjustment. The filters are Journey, Maverick and Memory. Photo: Realme IndiaThe Realme 12 Pro+ 5G has a triple camera setup at the rear.

It has a resolution of 4,096 x 3,072 and an aperture of f/1.8, while the 24mm equivalent focal length provides a wide field of view (FOV) of 84°.Photo: Realme IndiaInstead of using a macro camera or a depth sensor, Realme has stepped the game with a 64MP periscope portrait camera with an OmniVision OV64B sensor. It delivers a resolution of 4,624 x 3,472 and supports OIS for steady telephoto shots. With an aperture of f/2.8 and a focal length equivalent to 71mm, it delivers impressive portrait shots with a narrow FOV of 33° and 3x optical zoom.

Role of entrepreneurship education in Nepal’s quest for economic empowerment ,"Ram Bujhaun Yadav with his land ownership certificate stands near a border pillar which he says was erroneously placed on his land. In October 2023, when 51-year-old Ram Bujhaun Yadav of Musaharnia Rural Municipality-5, Mukhiyapatti, Dhanusha, was at a relative’s house, someone told him that two Indian Sashastra Seema Bal (SSB) personnel were looking for him.Anxious, he rushed home wondering why they were looking for him.“They asked me if the paddy field in the no man’s land was mine. I told them yes and they asked me to cut down the paddy immediately,” he said.The paddy was not ripe and Yadav asked them for some time. However, the SSB personnel told him he had to cut down his paddy immediately.Ram Bujhaun and his wife Tetari Devi each own a 677-square-metre plot of land. As Nepal and India reevaluated the border, Ram Bujhan’s land was been deemed to be near the no man’s land as it now has two demarcation pillars.Frustrated, Ram Bujhaun cut the paddy before it was due to be harvested. Now, he has been asked to not plant anything on the land as it falls in the no man’s land.“Our border police don’t say a word. I can’t fight the SSB on my own,” says Ram Bujhaun adding he had decided not to plan anything on the land anymore.Woes of the farmersMany farmers in southern Nepal say their land has now been placed in India after the recent demarcation. When the Jamuna River, which flows through the no man’s land between Nepal and India, changed its course some two decades ago, some border pillars went missing. Locals say these pillars have now been placed encroaching on Nepali land.In 2018, with the then Chief District Officer of Dhanusha, Pradeep Raj Kandel, and an official from Madhubani district, Bihar, India, a team that included border security forces from both countries, the Armed Police Force of Nepal, and SSB of India began placing border pillars after land measurement by technicians.Locals have raised concerns, stating that border pillars have been positioned, encroaching approximately 50 to 100 meters of land into Nepal compared to the previous position. Many like Ram Bujhaun are unaware of when these border pillars were placed.“I did not know that pillar was placed here. After I found out when I asked the village leaders, many said they were placing the border pillars as they pleased,” said Ram Bujhaun.He was told to carry on planting paddy and that it would not matter as these issues had happened in the past. “They encroached on my land and have asked me not to plant anything. This is gross injustice,” he says.Ram Bujhaun’s family owns a total of 4,000 square metres of land, with 2,000 square metres belonging to him and the remaining 2,000 square metres to his brother Bechan. However, 1,000 square metres of his land is now located on the Indian side after the demarcation. Despite this, he has been farming on the land and continues to pay taxes to the Department of Land Management and Archive in Nepal.“They have marked my land to be on the Indian side and placed border pillars on it. I’ve been farming till now but I don’t know when they will ask me to stop,” he says.Ignorance of the governmentThe Madhesh province in southern NepalThe former ward chair of Mukhiyapatti Musharniya Rural Municipality-5, Ram Naresh Yadav, said that over time, India has encroached on numerous Nepali lands in various locations in the Madhesh Province. This, he says, happened due to the Nepali administration’s ignorance and weak stature.“They (Nepali administration) were careless and that meant the Indian side placed these border pillars by encroaching on Nepali land,” says Ram Naresh.He said that over 40 farmers from wards 1, 5, and 6 have land ranging from 300 to 1,600 square metres on the Indian side. “These farmers have land ownership certificates, but they cannot farm as the SSB says the land is in India and not Nepal,” said Ram Naresh.In 1996, land ownership certificates were distributed after surveying the land in the border area. Local Dharmendra Kumar Yadav said that since then, the locals have been paying their land tax regularly. In 2018, when the pillar was being placed, the locals protested when they saw their land was being encroached on. However, since the demarcation had been agreed upon by high-ranking government officials of Nepal and India, the farmer’s voices went unheard.“We tried to stop when the border pillars were being placed on our land. But the administrators from both sides forcibly put it there without even trying to hold a discussion,” said Harish Chandra Yadav. The Chief District Officer of Dhanusha, Chakrapani Pandey, says that the border pillars were placed by the technical team after the measurements and with the agreement of the high-ranking officials of the two countries.“The fields and houses that are built in no man’s land have recently been cleared. No one can do anything in this particular area,” said Pandey. “We understand the people’s concern but we cannot do anything about it now.”",['role entrepreneurship educ nepal ’ quest econom empower'],"['ram bujhaun yadav land ownership certif stand near border pillar say erron place land .', 'octob 2023 , 51-year-old ram bujhaun yadav musaharnia rural municipality-5 , mukhiyapatti , dhanusha , rel ’ hous , someon told two indian sashastra seema bal ( ssb ) personnel look him.anxi , rush home wonder look him . “ ask paddi field man ’ land mine .', 'told ye ask cut paddi immedi , ” said.th paddi ripe yadav ask time .', 'howev , ssb personnel told cut paddi immediately.ram bujhaun wife tetari devi 677-square-metr plot land .', 'nepal india reevalu border , ram bujhan ’ land deem near man ’ land two demarc pillars.frustr , ram bujhaun cut paddi due harvest .', ', ask plant anyth land fall man ’ land . “ border polic ’ say word .', '’ fight ssb , ” say ram bujhaun ad decid plan anyth land anymore.wo farmersmani farmer southern nepal say land place india recent demarc .', 'jamuna river , flow man ’ land nepal india , chang cours two decad ago , border pillar went miss .', 'local say pillar place encroach nepali land.in 2018 , chief district offic dhanusha , pradeep raj kandel , offici madhubani district , bihar , india , team includ border secur forc countri , arm polic forc nepal , ssb india began place border pillar land measur technicians.loc rais concern , state border pillar posit , encroach approxim 50 100 meter land nepal compar previou posit .', 'mani like ram bujhaun unawar border pillar place . “ know pillar place .', 'found ask villag leader , mani said place border pillar pleas , ” said ram bujhaun.h told carri plant paddi would matter issu happen past .', '“ encroach land ask plant anyth .', 'gross injustic , ” says.ram bujhaun ’ famili own total 4,000 squar metr land , 2,000 squar metr belong remain 2,000 squar metr brother bechan .', 'howev , 1,000 squar metr land locat indian side demarc .', 'despit , farm land continu pay tax depart land manag archiv nepal . “ mark land indian side place border pillar .', '’ farm till ’ know ask stop , ” says.ignor governmentth madhesh provinc southern nepalth former ward chair mukhiyapatti musharniya rural municipality-5 , ram naresh yadav , said time , india encroach numer nepali land variou locat madhesh provinc .', ', say , happen due nepali administr ’ ignor weak statur . “ ( nepali administr ) careless meant indian side place border pillar encroach nepali land , ” say ram naresh.h said 40 farmer ward 1 , 5 , 6 land rang 300 1,600 squar metr indian side .', '“ farmer land ownership certif , farm ssb say land india nepal , ” said ram naresh.in 1996 , land ownership certif distribut survey land border area .', 'local dharmendra kumar yadav said sinc , local pay land tax regularli .', '2018 , pillar place , local protest saw land encroach .', 'howev , sinc demarc agre upon high-rank govern offici nepal india , farmer ’ voic went unheard . “ tri stop border pillar place land .', 'administr side forcibl put without even tri hold discuss , ” said harish chandra yadav .', 'chief district offic dhanusha , chakrapani pandey , say border pillar place technic team measur agreement high-rank offici two countri . “ field hous built man ’ land recent clear .', 'one anyth particular area , ” said pandey .', '“ understand peopl ’ concern anyth . ”']"
National Assembly election taking place today ,"Photo by pippen on UnsplashLife is filled with surprises and unexpected events and it can change at any moment. The only thing certain in life is the uncertainty. Change is a natural and inevitable part of our lives, and it may be positive as well as negative.Even though it is not guaranteed that we will wake up in the morning, we set the alarm every night with the hope that we will wake up in the morning. We do not know what each day is going to bring us, but we may have varieties, adventures, and endless opportunities.The push to exploreThe uncertainty sometimes forces us to explore those aspects of life, we never knew existed or needed. It also tests the mental strength of people and how they deal with it. The uncertainty has taught me to be grateful, as we never know what life throws at us.In life, everything does not go according to our plans, and if we do not embrace the change we will face huge trouble. The Covid-19 pandemic is the best example of uncertainty, we were constantly fearing death and it was uncertain that we would see the sunrise the next day.It is not certain that every decision in life will be correct, but if you fear not trying at all, you miss endless opportunities for learning and growing. When our decisions or outcomes are on the negative side, we get depressed and we might tend to think about committing suicide, but we forget that if we have life we have endless opportunities. Most of us plan for our careers, our love life, etc. and when those plans do not work out we start getting uncomfortable. But if we can deal with today, we can surely deal with tomorrow. We need to cherish little moments in our lives and know that nothing is permanent not even the failures and setbacks.We come here with nothing and leave with nothing. So why should we hold the egos and grudges against each other? Instead of making our life meaningful and enjoying the journey of life, we get into puzzles of accumulating wealth and we go against our own loved ones for it. Change is certainPhoto by Kathyryn Tripp on UnsplashNothing is permanent in life, everything can change in fractions of seconds. In today’s society, everyone is so busy, that we people have so less time for our loved ones. What I have learned over the years, is to find time in our busy schedule for our family because we never know when it will be our last day together with them. Yes! Death is a natural process, so if you have to die someday, why should you die with grudges in your heart? But instead of worrying about the inevitable, focusing on the things you can control will bring a lot of happiness in life.Uncertainty is not only a negative thing; it also brings a lot of opportunity because you dare to change. The life-changing experience will not come knocking down your door, you need to expose yourself. We learn by doing and experimenting, even though we might fail. But that is not the end of the world. I still remember hesitating while applying for the role of leadership, at my school level as it was not certain that I would be chosen.Even after being selected, I was uncertain about whether I could fulfil my responsibilities or not. But that uncertainty helped me grow out of my comfort zone and give my best input. If I had not applied for that role just because I was uncertain of the outcome, I would miss the biggest learning opportunity in my school life. So, do not let the uncertainty or the unknown ever stop you from trying and no matter how much we try, to plan life always finds a way to surprise us. It is important to stay grounded when we have everything we wish for because life can take such a turn that we had never expected in our wildest dreams. Similarly, nothing is permanent in life, the financial hardships, the grades, the breakups, etc. But the most important thing is not to lose hope during those difficult times.According to the data provided by Nepal police, around 6,830 people took their lives in the fiscal year 2022/23. There is nothing in life that cannot be resolved although it may take time, committing suicide should not be an option. It’s important to share feelings among family members or loved ones because together as a family any problem can be overcome.Embrace the unknown and focus on enhancing your life, instead of worrying about what will happen next. Always find time for your loved ones, as life is uncertain. We should be grateful that we are alive and accept that change is the only constant thing in life. Do not let the unknown, stop you from trying or achieving your goals and always remember that even if you fail, you still have endless opportunities.",['nation assembl elect take place today'],"['photo pippen unsplashlif fill surpris unexpect event chang moment .', 'thing certain life uncertainti .', 'chang natur inevit part live , may posit well negative.even though guarante wake morn , set alarm everi night hope wake morn .', 'know day go bring us , may varieti , adventur , endless opportunities.th push exploreth uncertainti sometim forc us explor aspect life , never knew exist need .', 'also test mental strength peopl deal .', 'uncertainti taught grate , never know life throw us.in life , everyth go accord plan , embrac chang face huge troubl .', 'covid-19 pandem best exampl uncertainti , constantli fear death uncertain would see sunris next day.it certain everi decis life correct , fear tri , miss endless opportun learn grow .', 'decis outcom neg side , get depress might tend think commit suicid , forget life endless opportun .', 'us plan career , love life , etc .', 'plan work start get uncomfort .', 'deal today , sure deal tomorrow .', 'need cherish littl moment live know noth perman even failur setbacks.w come noth leav noth .', 'hold ego grudg ?', 'instead make life meaning enjoy journey life , get puzzl accumul wealth go love one .', 'chang certainphoto kathyryn tripp unsplashnoth perman life , everyth chang fraction second .', 'today ’ societi , everyon busi , peopl less time love one .', 'learn year , find time busi schedul famili never know last day togeth .', 'ye !', 'death natur process , die someday , die grudg heart ?', 'instead worri inevit , focus thing control bring lot happi life.uncertainti neg thing ; also bring lot opportun dare chang .', 'life-chang experi come knock door , need expos .', 'learn experi , even though might fail .', 'end world .', 'still rememb hesit appli role leadership , school level certain would chosen.even select , uncertain whether could fulfil respons .', 'uncertainti help grow comfort zone give best input .', 'appli role uncertain outcom , would miss biggest learn opportun school life .', ', let uncertainti unknown ever stop tri matter much tri , plan life alway find way surpris us .', 'import stay ground everyth wish life take turn never expect wildest dream .', 'similarli , noth perman life , financi hardship , grade , breakup , etc .', 'import thing lose hope difficult times.accord data provid nepal polic , around 6,830 peopl took live fiscal year 2022/23 .', 'noth life resolv although may take time , commit suicid option .', '’ import share feel among famili member love one togeth famili problem overcome.embrac unknown focu enhanc life , instead worri happen next .', 'alway find time love one , life uncertain .', 'grate aliv accept chang constant thing life .', 'let unknown , stop tri achiev goal alway rememb even fail , still endless opportun .']"

Nepal to send 234 athletes for 19th Asian Games,"Tyson Moktan the first registered Crossfit L1 Trainer in Nepal. Photo Courtesy: Ox StrengthFitness has become a top priority for those considering health and well-being. It has gained immense popularity across all social media platforms, and fitness influencers have emerged as influential agents of change, motivating millions. And when it comes to fitness, Tyson Moktan is one of these influencers, as he has established himself as a trailblazing powerlifter in the country.Starting as a passionate athlete and talented tennis player, Moktan has now become the country’s first professional powerlifter. He has achieved remarkable personal milestones and gained respect as a strength powerlifting coach. He has taken part in countless competitions in Nepal and abroad becoming one of to go to guys for powerlifting in the country.Now, Moktan, who is a strength powerlifting coach at Ox Strength, wants to continue grooming young talents. Having successfully coached multiple national champions, his passion continues to drive him to support and nurture young talent. He firmly believes that by providing guidance and mentorship to emerging athletes, he can contribute to putting Nepal on the global map of powerlifting.Getting into the zonePhoto Courtesy: Ox StrengthTyson Moktan has been a highly competitive individual since his childhood. He embarked on his fitness journey at the age of 16 as he wanted to stay in shape. He was into sports from his childhood but gradually shifted to bodybuilding as he had a knack for it. As a year went by, he found his true passion – powerlifting.“As I have been competitive all my life, I wanted an outlet to pursue a gym lifestyle, so I initially explored bodybuilding and men’s physique. However, in the end, I realised that powerlifting was the perfect fit for me,” he says.Powerlifting is an extremely demanding form of fitness that requires immense dedication and effort. At the time when he started, Nepal had no professional powerlifters, but Moktan took it upon himself to pioneer the sport in the country.“I conducted extensive research and received online coaching, which significantly enhanced my skills and knowledge in powerlifting,” he says. However, finding suitable platforms for showcasing his talent was a challenge.“When I ventured into powerlifting, it was still a relatively new concept in our country. I was searching for a competitive outlet and started participating in local competitions in Nepal,” he says.Tyson Moktan has always made it a priority to stay updated with the latest information and technology in the fitness industry. He has crafted a routine that has remained consistent and rewarding since the beginning. His passion for the gym and the incredible outcomes it brings have made training an integral part of his life.Photo Courtesy: Ox Strength“My fitness routine has remained the same since the beginning. I don’t feel the need to change it because I love doing it passionately. I can’t go a few days without training. It has become a natural part of my progression,” he says.Tyson Moktan’s first powerlifting competition in 2016 thrust him into the spotlight of the Nepali fitness industry. Following that, he became the first registered Crossfit L1 Trainer in Nepal and embarked on his coaching career.One of Moktan’s most impactful moments occurred in late 2017 when he achieved a monumental lift of 250 kg, a weight that no one from Nepal had accomplished before. This achievement strengthened his belief in the power of determination and motivated him to train even harder.“I felt like I could do anything if I put my mind to it. It was an incredible feeling of being on top of the world,” he says.From that day forward, Tyson Moktan dedicated himself to becoming a top powerlifter. Understanding his end goals, creating sustainable plans, and trusting the process became the key pillars of his success. Moktan has been a winner of the pump powerlifting meet open categories from 2016- 2018. In 2020, he also bagged the second position and set a national squat record with 245.5 kg during the Thailand National Championships U93. He aspires to continue pushing the boundaries in the sport as an athlete himself while helping other athletes and fitness enthusiasts reach their full potential.Photo Courtesy: Ox StrengthWith his years of training, experience, education, and knowledge, Moktan has established Ox Strength to coach individuals virtually, aiming to achieve unimaginable goals.A life of determinationTyson Moktan places great emphasis on the importance of proper planning in one’s fitness journey. He believes that sustainable progress and dedication can be achieved by getting in the zone and following a well-thought-out plan.“There is a quote that says, ‘Failing to plan is planning to fail.’ I strongly adhere to that. As long as you have a sustainable plan and a clear understanding of your end goal, planning and taking one step at a time while trusting the process is all you need,” he says.In a world where the lines can often be blurred by performance-enhancing drugs, Moktan firmly believes in maintaining a natural approach to fitness. He meticulously balances his diet and avoids relying on supplements, instead focusing on a wholesome approach to nutrition.“There is a clear distinction between protein shakes and performance-enhancing substances. I believe in staying natural and considering supplements as a convenient form of food that helps complete my protein intake,” he says.Reflecting on prevalent trends in the fitness industry, Moktan advocates for a discerning approach. While flashy movements may initially attract people to sports and fitness, he believes that true progress lies in sticking to the basics and understanding one’s journey.Moktan strongly believes in delivering quality content that offers valuable information to his followers. He remains dedicated to his small yet loyal audience who seek his coaching expertise and support him wholeheartedly. He consciously chooses not to chase fleeting trends or prioritise being at the top of social media.Photo Courtesy: Ox Strength“I believe in sticking to the basics. I don’t force myself to follow the latest trends. Providing quality information and valuable tips is important to me. I have a small group of dedicated followers on social media, and that is what matters to us. We are not targeting a large audience who are just there for entertainment,” he says.Tyson Moktan’s coaching extends beyond the realm of powerlifting, as he also assists individuals on weight loss journeys and helps athletes achieve multiple national records.“Each client is unique, with different backgrounds, experiences, and challenges. Effective communication and understanding are crucial. I work closely with my clients to develop personalised training programs that ensure long-term success,” he says.With his unwavering dedication, pioneering spirit, and commitment to sustainable training, Tyson Moktan continues to make a lasting impact in the world of strength sports and coaching.",['nepal send 234 athlet 19th asian game'],"['tyson moktan first regist crossfit l1 trainer

Nepali women’s football team drawn into a tough group in the 19th Asian Games,"Kathmandu, July 14Pakistan A beat Nepal by four wickets during the ACC Emerging Team’s Asia Cup being held in Sri Lanka.Winning the toss and batting first, Nepal got off to a poor start losing six wickets by the 10th over. The Nepali batters struggled to cope with the pace bowling of Shahnawaz Dahani Muhammad Wasim as they pestered the batters with short balls which the Nepalis have struggled with since the ICC World Cup Qualifiers.At 72 for eight, it was looking like Nepal would not reach the 100 mark but superb innings by Sompal Kami who scored 75 runs took Nepal to 179. Kami put up a 58-run stand with Pratish GC and a 49-run stand with Lalit Rajbanshi to take Nepal to a respectable score.In reply, Pakistan A reached the total with 103 balls to spare. Despite losing regular wickets, Muhammad Tayyab Tahir and Kamran Ghulam helped take Pakistan A home as the Nepali bowlers did not look threatening.Nepal will take on India A on July 17.",['nepali women ’ footbal team drawn tough group 19th asian game'],"['kathmandu , juli 14pakistan beat nepal four wicket acc emerg team ’ asia cup held sri lanka.win toss bat first , nepal got poor start lose six wicket 10th .', 'nepali batter struggl cope pace bowl shahnawaz dahani muhammad wasim pester batter short ball nepali struggl sinc icc world cup qualifiers.at 72 eight , look like nepal would reach 100 mark superb inning sompal kami score 75 run took nepal 179 .', 'kami put 58-run stand pratish gc 49-run stand lalit rajbanshi take nepal respect score.in repli , pakistan reach total 103 ball spare .', 'despit lose regular wicket , muhammad tayyab tahir kamran ghulam help take pakistan home nepali bowler look threatening.nep take india juli 17 .']"
Nepal to face Laos in the first round of the 2026 World Cup Qualifier,"As untouched and less discussed as the sports management industry is in Nepal, it has ample room to showcase creativity. Photo by Miguel Bruna on UnsplashIn 2023, Barbie named Women in Sports as their career of the year.Whenever I am out and about socially, there is always someone who seems pretty certain about not considering my profession as mainstream. Hold up! Sports as a career? In Nepal? You bet! This article aims to explain why women in this male-dominant sports industry in Nepal should not be viewed as a surprise.I have been part of the Nepali cricket industry in a private capacity for quite a while now. Armed with a Master’s Degree in IT from an American University, my choice to stick with sports management tends to raise eyebrows. While I am not an on-field player, I am definitely behind the scenes, playing strong games of serious deliverance with my team. We are all about creating what is not there.As untouched and less discussed as the sports management industry is in Nepal, it has ample room to showcase creativity. Being a commanding woman in a position can be challenging, but on the brighter side, the gender advantage has yet to fail me. As alien as I might be in sports management in Nepal, I have been accepted with open arms. The nature of the job is highly competitive, no doubt.Embraced by the sports fraternityPhoto: PixabayWomen in sports are safe, heard, and welcomed. I absolutely relish the addition of spirited women to the team. The nuances of sports are something women complement greatly. Sports management inherently rejects narrow minds. There is a lot of travelling, meeting people, experimenting, and remembering limitations. The adjustments are both trivial and clever. Often, in our part of the world, societal norms limit women from making career decisions, hindering them from living life on their terms. This restriction potentially keeps many capable women from pursuing the sports industry, where they could truly wield their power to make an impact. Change is gradual, and I hope to see numerous female faces in charge of stadiums someday in Nepal.Yes, there are challenges. It ranges from personal sacrifices to job security and opportunities. However, these are workable factors for any freelancer in sports management. The key is excelling at our jobs to thrive anywhere. Taking a page from the medical field, the seriousness we apply there should not differ in sports management. Sports is a powerful industry. Children grow up idolising what we showcase on TV. As glorious as the game is, it is every child’s dream to represent their country someday. Carrying that responsibility is our role in sports—an often thankless yet deeply satisfying job.Nepali sports industryThe fans went wild at TU Cricket Ground after Nepal beat UAE.Sports may be a smaller industry in Nepal, but globally, it is a behemoth. The world economy has shifted, and it is time we alter our perspective to recognise the potential of sports as an industry in Nepal. The idea of open commercialisation of sports remains somewhat unexplored, as it continues to be a more exclusive affair in Nepal. By sourcing innovative ideas, there’s a wealth of public attention and investment waiting to be tapped into, along with numerous practices to establish and discard. As the Nepali team achieves international records, the packaging of the sport becomes everything. There is plenty to learn from international sports management to make our industry highly marketable and poised for global entry.Sports such as cricket, football, volleyball, or even golf serve as key intersections for reshaping Nepal’s global narrative. Over the years, Kabaddi has witnessed a substantial surge in India, both in terms of viewership and commercial success. The primary challenge we grapple with is Nepal’s comparatively small market size, posing constraints on our ability to generate substantial economic gains. Therefore, there is unanimous agreement on the imperative for Nepal’s sports to venture onto the international stage.Nepal boasts many hardworking individuals, yet achieving this goal demands specialised talents in sports management with the requisite experience and the capacity to enhance existing values. In the long run, outsourcing such talents may foster dependence. Hence, a concerted effort is needed to inspire Nepali youth to engage in sports management, contributing to our sports ecosystem. There are various ways in which we can harness the potential of sports for our benefit. Encouraging youth involvement can be instrumental in capitalising on the multifaceted opportunities presented by the sports industry. There is a lot to explore if you think about it.",['nepal face lao first round 2026 world cup qualifi'],"['untouch less discuss sport manag industri nepal , ampl room showcas creativ .', 'photo miguel bruna unsplashin 2023 , barbi name women sport career year.whenev social , alway someon seem pretti certain consid profess mainstream .', 'hold !', 'sport career ?', 'nepal ?', 'bet !', 'articl aim explain women male-domin sport industri nepal view surprise.i part nepali cricket industri privat capac quit .', 'arm master ’ degre american univers , choic stick sport manag tend rais eyebrow .', 'on-field player , definit behind scene , play strong game seriou deliver team .', 'creat there.a untouch less discuss sport manag industri nepal , ampl room showcas creativ .', 'command woman posit challeng , brighter side , gender advantag yet fail .', 'alien might sport manag nepal , accept open arm .', 'natur job highli competit , doubt.embrac sport fraternityphoto : pixabaywomen sport safe , heard , welcom .', 'absolut relish addit spirit women team .', 'nuanc sport someth women complement greatli .', 'sport manag inher reject narrow mind .', 'lot travel , meet peopl , experi , rememb limit .', 'adjust trivial clever .', 'often , part world , societ norm limit women make career decis , hinder live life term .', 'restrict potenti keep mani capabl women pursu sport industri , could truli wield power make impact .', 'chang gradual , hope see numer femal face charg stadium someday nepal.y , challeng .', 'rang person sacrific job secur opportun .', 'howev , workabl factor freelanc sport manag .', 'key excel job thrive anywher .', 'take page medic field , serious appli differ sport manag .', 'sport power industri .', 'children grow idolis showcas tv .', 'gloriou game , everi child ’ dream repres countri someday .', 'carri respons role sports—an often thankless yet deepli satisfi job.nepali sport industryth fan went wild tu cricket ground nepal beat uae.sport may smaller industri nepal , global , behemoth .', 'world economi shift , time alter perspect recognis potenti sport industri nepal .', 'idea open commercialis sport remain somewhat unexplor , continu exclus affair nepal .', 'sourc innov idea , ’ wealth public attent invest wait tap , along numer practic establish discard .', 'nepali team achiev intern record , packag sport becom everyth .', 'plenti learn intern sport manag make industri highli market pois global entry.sport cricket , footbal , volleybal , even golf serv key intersect reshap nepal ’ global narr .', 'year , kabaddi wit substanti surg india , term viewership commerci success .', 'primari challeng grappl nepal ’ compar small market size , pose constraint abil gener substanti econom gain .', 'therefor , unanim agreement imper nepal ’ sport ventur onto intern stage.nep boast mani hardwork individu , yet achiev goal demand specialis talent sport manag requisit experi capac enhanc exist valu .', 'long run , outsourc talent may foster depend .', 'henc , concert effort need inspir nepali youth engag sport manag , contribut sport ecosystem .', 'variou way har potenti sport benefit .', 'encourag youth involv instrument capitalis multifacet opportun present sport industri .', 'lot explor think .']"
Nasir Yahya Hussain and Gaurika Singh set national records in World Aquatic Championship,"Painting ‘My Private Life’ by artist Priyam Pradhan at the exhibition Mani at Siddhartha Art Gallery, Baber Mahal. Photo: Chandra Bahadur AleUsing Pitt’s artist pen on paper, artist Priyam Pradhan presents My Private Life, a showcase of the current significance of his life depicted in abstract form.At the centre of the painting is a 1000-rupee note, within which Pradhan has intricately painted Lord Krishna, a man wearing a hoodie tenderly embracing his dog, and a woman. The woman stands tall, elongated in form. Towards the bottom of the canvas, a holy man reaches out his hands, appearing to be in flight.Priyam Pradhan has used a vibrant colour palette, incorporating bright hues such as pink, orange, and yellow, as well as green, black, white, and grey. This combination adds a dynamic and lively quality to the artwork.“The man in the centre is me and the girl in green is my girlfriend. And the faces are my mom and dad,” says Pradhan. “The sadhu (holy man) symbolises my desires that I don’t have many desires for materialistic things however I do understand the value of money.”The use of colours, figures and lines in an abstract form in his painting resembles the painting of American painter Paul Jackson Pollock. Like his abstract expressionism, Pradhan has expressed himself in his painting.Furthermore, this marks Priyam Pradhan’s third solo painting exhibition titled Mani (money), inaugurated on January 17 at Siddhartha Art Gallery, Baber Mahal.In his previous exhibitions, Pradhan’s artworks centred around Hindu philosophy and his spontaneous thought process. However, in this latest exhibition, he explores the theme of money and its impact on an individual’s life, delving into the reverberating effects of financial aspects.Understanding the value of moneyPaintings by artist Priyam Pradhan at Siddhartha Art Gallery, Baber Mahal. Photo: Chandra Bahadur AleAny form of art is known as a reflection of the contemporary time. Likewise, Priyam Pradhan’s paintings reflect the lifestyle, desires, obligations and more of today’s younger generation living in urban areas in Nepal.Pradhan himself is in his 20s and he has justified the want of most of the youngsters in their 20s, who might be declared adults and understand the need for money and materialistic things but are still kids at their heart who want to explore and experience life as much as possible.The exhibition has 27 paintings which Pradhan took around nine months to complete. According to him, while he was travelling the idea that his life was luxurious and him being capable of exploring anything he wanted to was because of money.And being an artist this concept lingered on him and he was compelled to create on the theme of money.Once you enter the gallery, you can also view an animated video, which introduces artist Pradhan and the importance of money, which is on the ground floor. On the first floor, a huge painting (193×62 in cm) Apatkalin Awastha using mixed media on canvas welcomes you and other paintings are small in size (18×30 in cm).“It is a team work and it is my introduction as an artist for the exhibition,” he says. “Also, being a recent multimedia graduate from Islington College, I wanted to explore my skills and I got my team. Then, like money, multimedia is relevant to current society.”Experiencing life through artPainting by artist Priyam Pradhan at Siddhartha Art Gallery, Baber Mahal. Photo: Chandra Bahadur Ale Priyam Pradhan says enjoyment is the meaning of life and he enjoys creating artwork. Moreover, Pradhan who came into the art world first being a tattoo artist feels blessed that he has the privilege to explore whatever he likes in his life.He also believes that the philosophy that says one should not be materialistic is wrong. “If material things are not important, why would one build a house? And after building a house why do they want to decorate their house?” he questions.Alongside, money and materialistic things, his paintings also explore love, romance, life and childhood experiences. Motifs like Pokemon, ramen noodles, animals, dancers, etc have been used in his paintings. In most of his paintings, he has used numerous white lines in wavy form and these lines for Pradhan indicate the sound or the energy that exists in the surroundings all the time.About using a pitta artist pen, he says, “I have enjoyed drawing and painting since my childhood and using a pitta artist pen helps me revisit that feeling of happiness and sense of freedom.”So many things happening on the canvas with the use of vibrant colours gives a sense of excitement to the viewers. Though referencing artists like Pollock, MF Husain, Picasso and more, his pen strokes give a sense of newness through his expression and thoughts about his life experiences.In his paintings, these bright colours and motifs are in harmony and are visual treats that can surely cheer up the mood of any visitor. Moreover, you can also get free stickers from the artist.If you too are in a gloomy mood and want to uplift a little, visit the exhibition that continues till February 6.",['nasir yahya hussain gaurika singh set nation record world aquat championship'],"['paint ‘ privat life ’ artist priyam pradhan exhibit mani siddhartha art galleri , baber mahal .', 'photo : chandra bahadur aleus pitt ’ artist pen paper , artist priyam pradhan present privat life , showcas current signific life depict abstract form.at centr paint 1000-rupe note , within pradhan intric paint lord krishna , man wear hoodi tenderli embrac dog , woman .', 'woman stand tall , elong form .', 'toward bottom canva , holi man reach hand , appear flight.priyam pradhan use vibrant colour palett , incorpor bright hue pink , orang , yellow , well green , black , white , grey .', 'combin add dynam live qualiti artwork . “ man centr girl green girlfriend .', 'face mom dad , ” say pradhan .', '“ sadhu ( holi man ) symbolis desir ’ mani desir materialist thing howev understand valu money . ” use colour , figur line abstract form paint resembl paint american painter paul jackson pollock .', 'like abstract expression , pradhan express painting.furthermor , mark priyam pradhan ’ third solo paint exhibit titl mani ( money ) , inaugur januari 17 siddhartha art galleri , baber mahal.in previou exhibit , pradhan ’ artwork centr around hindu philosophi spontan thought process .', 'howev , latest exhibit , explor theme money impact individu ’ life , delv reverber effect financi aspects.understand valu moneypaint artist priyam pradhan siddhartha art galleri , baber mahal .', 'photo : chandra bahadur aleani form art known reflect contemporari time .', 'likewis , priyam pradhan ’ paint reflect lifestyl , desir , oblig today ’ younger gener live urban area nepal.pradhan 20 justifi want youngster 20 , might declar adult understand need money materialist thing still kid heart want explor experi life much possible.th exhibit 27 paint pradhan took around nine month complet .', 'accord , travel idea life luxuri capabl explor anyth want money.and artist concept linger compel creat theme money.onc enter galleri , also view anim video , introduc artist pradhan import money , ground floor .', 'first floor , huge paint ( 193×62 cm ) apatkalin awastha use mix media canva welcom paint small size ( 18×30 cm ) . “ team work introduct artist exhibit , ” say .', '“ also , recent multimedia graduat islington colleg , want explor skill got team .', ', like money , multimedia relev current societi . ” experienc life artpaint artist priyam pradhan siddhartha art galleri , baber mahal .', 'photo : chandra bahadur ale priyam pradhan say enjoy mean life enjoy creat artwork .', 'moreov , pradhan came art world first tattoo artist feel bless privileg explor whatev like life.h also believ philosophi say one materialist wrong .', '“ materi thing import , would one build hous ?', 'build hous want decor hous ? ” questions.alongsid , money materialist thing , paint also explor love , romanc , life childhood experi .', 'motif like pokemon , ramen noodl , anim , dancer , etc use paint .', 'paint , use numer white line wavi form line pradhan indic sound energi exist surround time.about use pitta artist pen , say , “ enjoy draw paint sinc childhood use pitta artist pen help revisit feel happi sens freedom . ” mani thing happen canva use vibrant colour give sens excit viewer .', 'though referenc artist like pollock , mf husain , picasso , pen stroke give sens new express thought life experiences.in paint , bright colour motif harmoni visual treat sure cheer mood visitor .', 'moreov , also get free sticker artist.if gloomi mood want uplift littl , visit exhibit continu till februari 6 .']"
Nasir Yahya Hussain sets new national record in 400m freestyle in World Aquatic Championship 2023,"Entrepreneurship education is not just an investment in the education system; it is an investment in the nation’s future prosperity. Photo: Pexels/ Rodnae ProductionsIn the shadow of the towering Himalayas, Nepal faces a challenge that rivals the steepness of its mountainous terrain- the challenge of economic development. As the nation earnestly pursues its Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), it becomes increasingly evident that a transformation in the education system is not only necessary but also urgent. Rooted in common living strategies, the prevailing education model, especially in higher education, may not adequately prepare the youth for the demands of the modern world. In this critical juncture, the incorporation of entrepreneurship education emerges as a beacon of hope, offering a pathway towards a self-reliant and prosperous Nepal.Time to reevaluate the education systemNepal’s journey towards economic prosperity has been marked by challenges that demand innovative solutions. The commitment of the SDGs reflects not only a global responsibility but also a domestic imperative for sustainable development. For this, it is high time to reevaluate the education system in the country.The current education system in Nepal, deeply entrenched in common living strategies, has been the foundation of learning for generations. However, in the face of a rapidly evolving world, today’s generation aspires for more than the status quo. The call for independence reverberates through the aspirations of youth who seek a curriculum fostering critical thinking, innovation and entrepreneurial skills.Entrepreneurship education is a dynamic force capable of reshaping Nepal’s educational landscape. This innovative approach moves beyond traditional learning methods, providing students with the tools to navigate the complexities of the modern world. At its core, entrepreneurship education is about empowering students to implement learned information in practical and tangible ways.Consider a student engrossed in the intricacies of sensor systems during a science class, entrepreneurship education transforms this theoretical knowledge into practical applications, inspiring the creation of a sensor-operated door. Such innovation born from a fusion of science and entrepreneurship becomes a valuable mindset in solving practical problems.  Expanding the horizons of entrepreneurship education, let us delve into chemistry. Imagine students studying chemistry not just as a theoretical subject, but also as entrepreneurs in the making. Armed with entrepreneurial principles, these students can tap into Nepal’s rich biodiversity, exploring market demands for products derived from local plants.In the scenario, chemistry students could embark on a journey to develop performance-enhancing products based on market demand, harnessing the potential of indigenous flora. What makes this approach remarkable is that it does not necessarily require sophisticated machines or extensive human resources. Instead, it leverages the inherent skills and awareness of individuals within the community, paving the way for a grassroots economic revolution.Entrepreneurship in education Representational graphic. Image: FreepikThe beauty of entrepreneurship education lies in its universal applicability. It is not confined to science or chemistry alone. Consider an art student, for example. Through entrepreneurship education, they can understand what art to develop (product), how much to set the price (price), where to sell (place) and how to sell (promote) their artworks. Every subject becomes a canvas for innovation and enterprise.Moreover, entrepreneurship education is a powerful equaliser, recognising the unique skills and talents of individuals across various disciplines. It is not about fitting into a predefined mould but rather about unleashing the potential within each student. When every single person is aware of their skills and potential, they can rise to different levels, contributing to the overall progress of the nation.Entrepreneurship education goes beyond skill recognition; it is about nurturing the ability to produce goods and mastering the art of marketing. Returning to the example of the student developing a sensor-operated door, entrepreneurship education not only equips them to produce the product but also teaches them how to navigate the complexities of marketing it to potential users and clients.The impact of entrepreneurship education extends beyond individual success stories; it reverberates through the entire nation. A generation equipped with entrepreneurial skills becomes a driving force for economic growth and independence. They will be able to recognise the resources and ideas to utilise them to reach the global market. They will be able to be the pioneers in products and contribute to the economy. By fostering a culture of innovation, creativity and self-reliance, Nepal can reduce its dependence on external sources and strengthen its economy from within.In essence, entrepreneurship education is not just an investment in the education system; it is an investment in the nation’s future prosperity. It is a transformative force that has the potential to shape a generation of independent thinkers, innovators and entrepreneurs- the architects of a self-reliant and economically vibrant Nepal. Entrepreneurship education, by teaching students to utilise available resources (physical and financial) and make them commercial, becomes a cornerstone in the nation’s journey towards economic empowerment and independence.",['nasir yahya hussain set new nation record 400m freestyl world aquat championship 2023'],"['entrepreneurship educ invest educ system ; invest nation ’ futur prosper .', 'photo : pexels/ rodna productionsin shadow tower himalaya , nepal face challeng rival steep mountain terrain- challeng econom develop .', 'nation earnestli pursu sustain develop goal ( sdg ) , becom increasingli evid transform educ system necessari also urgent .', 'root common live strategi , prevail educ model , especi higher educ , may adequ prepar youth demand modern world .', 'critic junctur , incorpor entrepreneurship educ emerg beacon hope , offer pathway toward self-reli prosper nepal.tim reevalu educ systemnep ’ journey toward econom prosper mark challeng demand innov solut .', 'commit sdg reflect global respons also domest imper sustain develop .', ', high time reevalu educ system country.th current educ system nepal , deepli entrench common live strategi , foundat learn gener .', 'howev , face rapidli evolv world , today ’ gener aspir statu quo .', 'call independ reverber aspir youth seek curriculum foster critic think , innov entrepreneuri skills.entrepreneurship educ dynam forc capabl reshap nepal ’ educ landscap .', 'innov approach move beyond tradit learn method , provid student tool navig complex modern world .', 'core , entrepreneurship educ empow student implement learn inform practic tangibl ways.consid student engross intricaci sensor system scienc class , entrepreneurship educ transform theoret knowledg practic applic , inspir creation sensor-oper door .', 'innov born fusion scienc entrepreneurship becom valuabl mindset solv practic problem .', 'expand horizon entrepreneurship educ , let us delv chemistri .', 'imagin student studi chemistri theoret subject , also entrepreneur make .', 'arm entrepreneuri principl , student tap nepal ’ rich biodivers , explor market demand product deriv local plants.in scenario , chemistri student could embark journey develop performance-enhanc product base market demand , har potenti indigen flora .', 'make approach remark necessarili requir sophist machin extens human resourc .', 'instead , leverag inher skill awar individu within commun , pave way grassroot econom revolution.entrepreneurship educ represent graphic .', 'imag : freepikth beauti entrepreneurship educ lie univers applic .', 'confin scienc chemistri alon .', 'consid art student , exampl .', 'entrepreneurship educ , understand art develop ( product ) , much set price ( price ) , sell ( place ) sell ( promot ) artwork .', 'everi subject becom canva innov enterprise.moreov , entrepreneurship educ power equalis , recognis uniqu skill talent individu across variou disciplin .', 'fit predefin mould rather unleash potenti within student .', 'everi singl person awar skill potenti , rise differ level , contribut overal progress nation.entrepreneurship educ goe beyond skill recognit ; nurtur abil produc good master art market .', 'return exampl student develop sensor-oper door , entrepreneurship educ equip produc product also teach navig complex market potenti user clients.th impact entrepreneurship educ extend beyond individu success stori ; reverber entir nation .', 'gener equip entrepreneuri skill becom drive forc econom growth independ .', 'abl recognis resourc idea utilis reach global market .', 'abl pioneer product contribut economi .', 'foster cultur innov , creativ self-reli , nepal reduc depend extern sourc strengthen economi within.in essenc , entrepreneurship educ invest educ system ; invest nation ’ futur prosper .', 'transform forc potenti shape gener independ thinker , innov entrepreneurs- architect self-reli econom vibrant nepal .', 'entrepreneurship educ , teach student utilis avail resourc ( physic financi ) make commerci , becom cornerston nation ’ journey toward econom empower independ .']"

Nepal Unilever Limited to sponsor Nepal women’s football team,"Ram Bujhaun Yadav with his land ownership certificate stands near a border pillar which he says was erroneously placed on his land. In October 2023, when 51-year-old Ram Bujhaun Yadav of Musaharnia Rural Municipality-5, Mukhiyapatti, Dhanusha, was at a relative’s house, someone told him that two Indian Sashastra Seema Bal (SSB) personnel were looking for him.Anxious, he rushed home wondering why they were looking for him.“They asked me if the paddy field in the no man’s land was mine. I told them yes and they asked me to cut down the paddy immediately,” he said.The paddy was not ripe and Yadav asked them for some time. However, the SSB personnel told him he had to cut down his paddy immediately.Ram Bujhaun and his wife Tetari Devi each own a 677-square-metre plot of land. As Nepal and India reevaluated the border, Ram Bujhan’s land was been deemed to be near the no man’s land as it now has two demarcation pillars.Frustrated, Ram Bujhaun cut the paddy before it was due to be harvested. Now, he has been asked to not plant anything on the land as it falls in the no man’s land.“Our border police don’t say a word. I can’t fight the SSB on my own,” says Ram Bujhaun adding he had decided not to plan anything on the land anymore.Woes of the farmersMany farmers in southern Nepal say their land has now been placed in India after the recent demarcation. When the Jamuna River, which flows through the no man’s land between Nepal and India, changed its course some two decades ago, some border pillars went missing. Locals say these pillars have now been placed encroaching on Nepali land.In 2018, with the then Chief District Officer of Dhanusha, Pradeep Raj Kandel, and an official from Madhubani district, Bihar, India, a team that included border security forces from both countries, the Armed Police Force of Nepal, and SSB of India began placing border pillars after land measurement by technicians.Locals have raised concerns, stating that border pillars have been positioned, encroaching approximately 50 to 100 meters of land into Nepal compared to the previous position. Many like Ram Bujhaun are unaware of when these border pillars were placed.“I did not know that pillar was placed here. After I found out when I asked the village leaders, many said they were placing the border pillars as they pleased,” said Ram Bujhaun.He was told to carry on planting paddy and that it would not matter as these issues had happened in the past. “They encroached on my land and have asked me not to plant anything. This is gross injustice,” he says.Ram Bujhaun’s family owns a total of 4,000 square metres of land, with 2,000 square metres belonging to him and the remaining 2,000 square metres to his brother Bechan. However, 1,000 square metres of his land is now located on the Indian side after the demarcation. Despite this, he has been farming on the land and continues to pay taxes to the Department of Land Management and Archive in Nepal.“They have marked my land to be on the Indian side and placed border pillars on it. I’ve been farming till now but I don’t know when they will ask me to stop,” he says.Ignorance of the governmentThe Madhesh province in southern NepalThe former ward chair of Mukhiyapatti Musharniya Rural Municipality-5, Ram Naresh Yadav, said that over time, India has encroached on numerous Nepali lands in various locations in the Madhesh Province. This, he says, happened due to the Nepali administration’s ignorance and weak stature.“They (Nepali administration) were careless and that meant the Indian side placed these border pillars by encroaching on Nepali land,” says Ram Naresh.He said that over 40 farmers from wards 1, 5, and 6 have land ranging from 300 to 1,600 square metres on the Indian side. “These farmers have land ownership certificates, but they cannot farm as the SSB says the land is in India and not Nepal,” said Ram Naresh.In 1996, land ownership certificates were distributed after surveying the land in the border area. Local Dharmendra Kumar Yadav said that since then, the locals have been paying their land tax regularly. In 2018, when the pillar was being placed, the locals protested when they saw their land was being encroached on. However, since the demarcation had been agreed upon by high-ranking government officials of Nepal and India, the farmer’s voices went unheard.“We tried to stop when the border pillars were being placed on our land. But the administrators from both sides forcibly put it there without even trying to hold a discussion,” said Harish Chandra Yadav. The Chief District Officer of Dhanusha, Chakrapani Pandey, says that the border pillars were placed by the technical team after the measurements and with the agreement of the high-ranking officials of the two countries.“The fields and houses that are built in no man’s land have recently been cleared. No one can do anything in this particular area,” said Pandey. “We understand the people’s concern but we cannot do anything about it now.”",['nepal unilev limit sponsor nepal women ’ footbal team'],"['ram bujhaun yadav land ownership certif stand near border pillar say erron place land .', 'octob 2023 , 51-year-old ram bujhaun yadav musaharnia rural municipality-5 , mukhiyapatti , dhanusha , rel ’ hous , someon told two indian sashastra seema bal ( ssb ) personnel look him.anxi , rush home wonder look him . “ ask paddi field man ’ land mine .', 'told ye ask cut paddi immedi , ” said.th paddi ripe yadav ask time .', 'howev , ssb personnel told cut paddi immediately.ram bujhaun wife tetari devi 677-square-metr plot land .', 'nepal india reevalu border , ram bujhan ’ land deem near man ’ land two demarc pillars.frustr , ram bujhaun cut paddi due harvest .', ', ask plant anyth land fall man ’ land . “ border polic ’ say word .', '’ fight ssb , ” say ram bujhaun ad decid plan anyth land anymore.wo farmersmani farmer southern nepal say land place india recent demarc .', 'jamuna river , flow man ’ land nepal india , chang cours two decad ago , border pillar went miss .', 'local say pillar place encroach nepali land.in 2018 , chief district offic dhanusha , pradeep raj kandel , offici madhubani district , bihar , india , team includ border secur forc countri , arm polic forc nepal , ssb india began place border pillar land measur technicians.loc rais concern , state border pillar posit , encroach approxim 50 100 meter land nepal compar previou posit .', 'mani like ram bujhaun unawar border pillar place . “ know pillar place .', 'found ask villag leader , mani said place border pillar pleas , ” said ram bujhaun.h told carri plant paddi would matter issu happen past .', '“ encroach land ask plant anyth .', 'gross injustic , ” says.ram bujhaun ’ famili own total 4,000 squar metr land , 2,000 squar metr belong remain 2,000 squar metr brother bechan .', 'howev , 1,000 squar metr land locat indian side demarc .', 'despit , farm land continu pay tax depart land manag archiv nepal . “ mark land indian side place border pillar .', '’ farm till ’ know ask stop , ” says.ignor governmentth madhesh provinc southern nepalth former ward chair mukhiyapatti musharniya rural municipality-5 , ram naresh yadav , said time , india encroach numer nepali land variou locat madhesh provinc .', ', say , happen due nepali administr ’ ignor weak statur . “ ( nepali administr ) careless meant indian side place border pillar encroach nepali land , ” say ram naresh.h said 40 farmer ward 1 , 5 , 6 land rang 300 1,600 squar metr indian side .', '“ farmer land ownership certif , farm ssb say land india nepal , ” said ram naresh.in 1996 , land ownership certif distribut survey land border area .', 'local dharmendra kumar yadav said sinc , local pay land tax regularli .', '2018 , pillar place , local protest saw land encroach .', 'howev , sinc demarc agre upon high-rank govern offici nepal india , farmer ’ voic went unheard . “ tri stop border pillar place land .', 'administr side forcibl put without even tri hold discuss , ” said harish chandra yadav .', 'chief district offic dhanusha , chakrapani pandey , say border pillar place technic team measur agreement high-rank offici two countri . “ field hous built man ’ land recent clear .', 'one anyth particular area , ” said pandey .', '“ understand peopl ’ concern anyth . ”']"
Man Bahadur Shrestha appointed new volleyball captain,"Regenerative braking representational image. Photo: FreepikThe electric vehicle market in Nepal has grown significantly over the past year. Electric four-wheelers and two-wheelers are being launched almost every month, spanning from passenger to commercial vehicles. Electric transportation appears to be an emerging trend in the automotive industry.New EVs are regularly introduced with advanced features as car companies develop unique electric platforms. One standout feature is regenerative braking.Regenerative braking was first introduced in 1967 by the American Motor Car Company (AMC) in their prototype electric vehicle, the AMC Amitron. However, Toyota became the automobile manufacturer to implement regenerative braking system (RBS) technology in their Prius series hybrid vehicles in 1997. Toyota brought up the new hybrid technology in the Prius when fuel prices were going up at a massive rate. 1997 Toyota Prius Hybrid. Photo: ToyotaBut what is regenerative braking? There are still many people confused about what it is, whether it is safe or helpful in fuel economy in hybrid cars and the regeneration of electricity in electric cars.In simple terms, regen braking is when a car saves energy by recharging its battery when you brake, helping it use less fuel or electricity and go further. Easy but scientifically, regen braking is a process used in vehicles where the kinetic energy produced during braking is converted into electrical energy through an electric motor acting as a generator. This electrical energy is then stored in the vehicle’s battery for later use, reducing energy wastage and increasing overall efficiency.Photo: FreepikRegen braking can be seen in all kinds of EVs, including cars, scooters, commercial vans, buses, bicycles, three-wheelers, and rickshaws. It now can be electrically managed to what extent the power and braking can be generated. Regenerative Braking work process in EVPrinciple of Operation: Regene braking works by turning the energy from slowing down into electricity.Electric Motor as a Generator: In EV or hybrid cars with regen braking, the motor changes roles from moving the car to making electricity when you brake.Switching Polarity: When you brake, the motor switches directions, turning energy from the wheels into electricity instead of using it to move the car.Generation of Electricity: The turning wheels make the motor produce electricity, which goes to the car’s battery.Power Electronics: Special electronics change the electricity from the motor into the right kind for charging the battery.Battery Charging: The electricity made during braking charges up the car’s battery, storing the energy for later.Integration with Hydraulic Braking System: Regenerative braking works with the regular brakes, blending them for smooth stopping.Photo: automotive-iqAdvantages and Disadvantages of Regenerative Braking The advantages are listed below:Energy Efficiency: Regenerative braking efficiently captures the kinetic energy generated during braking, effectively reducing energy wastage and contributing to a more sustainable driving experience.Extended Range: By using the energy that would otherwise be lost during braking as heat and sound, regenerative braking helps to extend the driving range of electric vehicles in instances such as travelling downhill. Reduced Brake Wear: Regenerative braking minimizes the strain on traditional braking components, mitigating wear and tear, and potentially extending the lifespan of the braking components such as brake pads, rotors and brake lines, thus reducing maintenance costs over time.Enhanced Driving Experience: Regenerative braking provides a smoother braking experience and a more responsive feel to drivers, enhancing overall driving comfort and control on the road.The disadvantages are listed below:Limited Effectiveness at Low Speeds: While regenerative braking efficiently recaptures energy during braking, its effectiveness diminishes at lower speeds which leads to decreased energy recovery compared to higher speeds.Complexity and Cost: Implementing regenerative braking adds complexity and cost to vehicle systems, potentially raising manufacturing and maintenance expenses, and impacting consumer affordability.Maintenance Requirements: Regenerative braking systems require periodic maintenance and calibration to ensure they operate optimally.Efficiency Variability: Regenerative braking may exhibit variability in efficiency under extreme weather conditions or on certain road surfaces, leading to fluctuations in overall energy recapture and impacting the vehicle’s efficiency.MisconceptionsFully Recharges Battery: Some mistakenly believe that regenerative braking fully replenishes the battery, but in reality, it only adds a modest amount of charge.Increases Braking Distances: There is a misconception that regenerative braking extends braking distances, but it enhances braking performance by complementing traditional brakes.High-Speed Only: While more effective at higher speeds, regenerative braking still functions at lower speeds, such as during city driving or stop-and-go traffic.Maintenance-Free: Despite requiring less maintenance than traditional brakes, regen braking systems still need periodic checks and maintenance to ensure proper operation.Significantly Boosts Range: While regen braking contributes to extending the driving range of electric vehicles, its impact is influenced by various factors beyond just braking efficiency.Only for Electric Cars: Although commonly associated with electric vehicles, regen braking systems are also found in some conventional vehicles, particularly those aiming to improve fuel efficiency with advanced technology.Photo: FreepikRegenerative braking might sound complicated, but it is pretty cool. Think of it as a way for EVs and hybrids to recycle energy when they slow down. Instead of just wasting that energy, regenerative braking turns it into electricity, which can then be used to power the battery.",['man bahadur shrestha appoint new volleybal captain'],"['regen brake represent imag .', 'photo : freepikth electr vehicl market nepal grown significantli past year .', 'electr four-wheel two-wheel launch almost everi month , span passeng commerci vehicl .', 'electr transport appear emerg trend automot industry.new ev regularli introduc advanc featur car compani develop uniqu electr platform .', 'one standout featur regen braking.regen brake first introduc 1967 american motor car compani ( amc ) prototyp electr vehicl , amc amitron .', 'howev , toyota becam automobil manufactur implement regen brake system ( rb ) technolog priu seri hybrid vehicl 1997 .', 'toyota brought new hybrid technolog priu fuel price go massiv rate .', '1997 toyota priu hybrid .', 'photo : toyotabut regen brake ?', 'still mani peopl confus , whether safe help fuel economi hybrid car regener electr electr cars.in simpl term , regen brake car save energi recharg batteri brake , help use less fuel electr go .', 'easi scientif , regen brake process use vehicl kinet energi produc brake convert electr energi electr motor act gener .', 'electr energi store vehicl ’ batteri later use , reduc energi wastag increas overal efficiency.photo : freepikregen brake seen kind ev , includ car , scooter , commerci van , buse , bicycl , three-wheel , rickshaw .', 'electr manag extent power brake gener .', 'regen brake work process evprincipl oper : regen brake work turn energi slow electricity.electr motor gener : ev hybrid car regen brake , motor chang role move car make electr brake.switch polar : brake , motor switch direct , turn energi wheel electr instead use move car.gener electr : turn wheel make motor produc electr , goe car ’ battery.pow electron : special electron chang electr motor right kind charg battery.batteri charg : electr made brake charg car ’ batteri , store energi later.integr hydraul brake system : regen brake work regular brake , blend smooth stopping.photo : automotive-iqadvantag disadvantag regen brake advantag list : energi effici : regen brake effici captur kinet energi gener brake , effect reduc energi wastag contribut sustain drive experience.extend rang : use energi would otherwis lost brake heat sound , regen brake help extend drive rang electr vehicl instanc travel downhil .', 'reduc brake wear : regen brake minim strain tradit brake compon , mitig wear tear , potenti extend lifespan brake compon brake pad , rotor brake line , thu reduc mainten cost time.enhanc drive experi : regen brake provid smoother brake experi respons feel driver , enhanc overal drive comfort control road.th disadvantag list : limit effect low speed : regen brake effici recaptur energi brake , effect diminish lower speed lead decreas energi recoveri compar higher speeds.complex cost : implement regen brake add complex cost vehicl system , potenti rais manufactur mainten expens , impact consum affordability.mainten requir : regen brake system requir period mainten calibr ensur oper optimally.effici variabl : regen brake may exhibit variabl effici extrem weather condit certain road surfac , lead fluctuat overal energi recaptur impact vehicl ’ efficiency.misconceptions recharg batteri : mistakenli believ regen brake fulli replenish batteri , realiti , add modest amount charge.increas brake distanc : misconcept regen brake extend brake distanc , enhanc brake perform complement tradit brakes.high-spe : effect higher speed , regen brake still function lower speed , citi drive stop-and-go traffic.maintenance-fre : despit requir less mainten tradit brake , regen brake system still need period check mainten ensur proper operation.significantli boost rang : regen brake contribut extend drive rang electr vehicl , impact influenc variou factor beyond brake efficiency.onli electr car : although commonli associ electr vehicl , regen brake system also found convent vehicl , particularli aim improv fuel effici advanc technology.photo : freepikregen brake might sound complic , pretti cool .', 'think way ev hybrid recycl energi slow .', 'instead wast energi , regen brake turn electr , use power batteri .']"
Emerging Team’s Asia Cup: India A humiliate Nepal to send them packing,"The snow leopard rescued from Urlabari is currently being kept at the Central Zoo in Lalitpur. Photo: Aryan DhimalAs the gates to the vet clinic at the Central Zoo in Lalitpur opened, more than two dozen photojournalists thronged the facility and surrounded a metal cage aiming their DSLR cameras at a snow leopard inside.“Please don’t come close to the animal,” the zoo’s vet, Radha Krishna Gharti, told approaching photojournalists. But in the gush of excitement to take exclusive photographs of the elusive cat, difficult to spot even in its prime habitats, there were few takers for the word of caution.Nepal’s Department of National Parks and Wildlife Conservation (DNPWC) organised the photo-op two days after the male subadult cat, which was until recently found in the country only at altitudes higher than 2,000-6,000 metres above sea level, was brought to the zoo from Urlabari town(146 m above sea level). According to the department, the animal has sustained injuries to its right foreleg and cannot stand upright.Although officials involved said they are looking at releasing the animal into the wild after it recuperates, doing so will be a daunting task, adding that the zoo may be the only place where it can now survive.Not a wild catReporters and photojournalists take photos of a snow leopard being held at the Central Zoo in Lalitpur, Nepal. Image by Abhaya Raj Joshi/ Mongabay“Nepali snow leopard experts have come up with two hypotheses to explain how the animal from the mountains landed up in the plains,” said Sharad Chandra Adhikari, member-secretary at the National Trust for Nature Conservation (NTNC), a semi-government body that manages the zoo in Lalitpur, a town in the Kathmandu Valley. The first of the two hypotheses made public during the photo-op-cum-press conference, is that it was raised in captivity and somehow managed to escape into the wild. The second is that it lost its orientation while trying to establish its territory after separating from its mother.Kulbhushansingh Suryawanshi, director of the India program, Snow Leopard Trust, said that both hypotheses are plausible explanations as to how the snow leopard got to the plains in Nepal.A DNPWC official, who wished to remain anonymous as he is not authorised to talk to the press, said that it was more likely that the animal had been raised in captivity. “The way it sipped the water and ate the food zoo staff offered indicates that it may have been raised in captivity,” the official said.Snow leopards are shy cats living at extreme altitudes in the steep mountainous areas of 12 countries in Central and South Asia. Their global population spread over altitudes of 500-5,800 m, is estimated to be between around 3,900 and 6,000 as detailed coordinated surveys of the population in the range countries are yet to be carried out. In Nepal, their population divided into three blocks (eastern, central and western) is estimated to be between 301 and 400.Adhikari from NTNC said that researchers will now examine the animal’s scat to analyse its diet and try to find out whether it was roaming in the wild or had been in some sort of captivity. Researchers are also preparing to analyse its genes to try to find out to which of the three metapopulations in Nepal it belongs. They will also observe the animal’s canine teeth and fur to look for clues.Relocation challenge A snow leopard found in Urlabari town in Nepal’s plains in a cage at the Central Zoo in Kathmandu. Photo: Aryan DhimalThe whole process could take a few months to complete, and summer could set in in Kathmandu by then, officials concede. “The current temperature in Kathmandu is suitable for snow leopards, as we are in the peak of winter,” said Madhu Chetri, a snow leopard researcher from NTNC. But that could change as spring season begins in the Northern Hemisphere.The DNPWC official said that regardless of the findings related to how the animal got to Urlabarli, the animal would have spent a significant amount of time with humans during its recovery phase. “That would mean that it would have gotten habituated with having humans around,” the official said.Sending such animals back into the wild is a challenge, as they may have lost their hunting and other adaptation skills, he added. In May last year, officials at the Chitwan National Park released two rescued rhino calves into the wild, with limited success. The safety of the animals, which had gotten used to having humans around, was compromised as poachers could easily approach and kill them. Eventually, they were transferred to an enclosure in eastern Nepal away from human intervention.Veteran conservationist Professor Karan Bahadur Shah said that rewilding the snow leopard would be a daunting task, as the animals are territorial. “If we just leave the animal in its natural habitat, it will get killed by other snow leopards defending their territory,” he said. “The best option would be to keep the animal in the zoo for the public to see.”But Nepal’s Central Zoo has its own set of problems. The facility, established in 1932 as a private collection, has limited space and has frequently run into financial trouble. Conservationists say the snow leopard would need special facilities to cater to its needs.“If the government decides that the snow leopard needs to remain at the zoo, we are ready to shoulder the responsibility,” said Adhikari. “We have set up special facilities for animals such as the red panda and chimpanzees,” he said. “We can do that for the snow leopard as well.”Those advocating for keeping the animal in the zoo also said that Nepal is a snow leopard range country and the public, especially the young generation, also needs to see the different animals found in the country. “It has great educational value,” said Shah.Snow leopard expert Suryawanshi from neighbouring India also said that it would be challenging to release the animal into the wild. “If the team at the zoo can establish the exact cause of this behaviour [why it ventured into the plains] and can keep the animal away from human contact, then it might be okay to release it back,” he said. “But otherwise, there is little hope for it in the wild. Better to let it live in the zoo.”Back at the zoo, after the photojournalists are done taking photos, it is the turn of the reporters to point their smartphones at the animal. Then there is a contingent of senior wildlife department officials waiting in line to catch a glimpse of the animal. “So much for keeping it away from human contact,” a conservationist observing the hullabaloo from a distance said.This story first appeared on Mongabay and Onlinekhabar is republishing it under a Creative Commons licence.",['emerg team ’ asia cup : india humili nepal send pack'],"['snow leopard rescu urlabari current kept central zoo lalitpur .', 'photo : aryan dhimala gate vet clinic central zoo lalitpur open , two dozen photojournalist throng facil surround metal cage aim dslr camera snow leopard insid . “ pleas ’ come close anim , ” zoo ’ vet , radha krishna gharti , told approach photojournalist .', 'gush excit take exclus photograph elus cat , difficult spot even prime habitat , taker word caution.nep ’ depart nation park wildlif conserv ( dnpwc ) organis photo-op two day male subadult cat , recent found countri altitud higher 2,000-6,000 metr sea level , brought zoo urlabari town ( 146 sea level ) .', 'accord depart , anim sustain injuri right foreleg stand upright.although offici involv said look releas anim wild recuper , daunt task , ad zoo may place survive.not wild catreport photojournalist take photo snow leopard held central zoo lalitpur , nepal .', 'imag abhaya raj joshi/ mongabay “ nepali snow leopard expert come two hypothes explain anim mountain land plain , ” said sharad chandra adhikari , member-secretari nation trust natur conserv ( ntnc ) , semi-govern bodi manag zoo lalitpur , town kathmandu valley .', 'first two hypothes made public photo-op-cum-press confer , rais captiv somehow manag escap wild .', 'second lost orient tri establish territori separ mother.kulbhushansingh suryawanshi , director india program , snow leopard trust , said hypothes plausibl explan snow leopard got plain nepal.a dnpwc offici , wish remain anonym authoris talk press , said like anim rais captiv .', '“ way sip water ate food zoo staff offer indic may rais captiv , ” offici said.snow leopard shi cat live extrem altitud steep mountain area 12 countri central south asia .', 'global popul spread altitud 500-5,800 , estim around 3,900 6,000 detail coordin survey popul rang countri yet carri .', 'nepal , popul divid three block ( eastern , central western ) estim 301 400.adhikari ntnc said research examin anim ’ scat analys diet tri find whether roam wild sort captiv .', 'research also prepar analys gene tri find three metapopul nepal belong .', 'also observ anim ’ canin teeth fur look clues.reloc challeng snow leopard found urlabari town nepal ’ plain cage central zoo kathmandu .', 'photo : aryan dhimalth whole process could take month complet , summer could set kathmandu , offici conced .', '“ current temperatur kathmandu suitabl snow leopard , peak winter , ” said madhu chetri , snow leopard research ntnc .', 'could chang spring season begin northern hemisphere.th dnpwc offici said regardless find relat anim got urlabarli , anim would spent signific amount time human recoveri phase .', '“ would mean would gotten habitu human around , ” offici said.send anim back wild challeng , may lost hunt adapt skill , ad .', 'may last year , offici chitwan nation park releas two rescu rhino calv wild , limit success .', 'safeti anim , gotten use human around , compromis poacher could easili approach kill .', 'eventu , transfer enclosur eastern nepal away human intervention.veteran conservationist professor karan bahadur shah said rewild snow leopard would daunt task , anim territori .', '“ leav anim natur habitat , get kill snow leopard defend territori , ” said .', '“ best option would keep anim zoo public see . ” nepal ’ central zoo set problem .', 'facil , establish 1932 privat collect , limit space frequent run financi troubl .', 'conservationist say snow leopard would need special facil cater need . “ govern decid snow leopard need remain zoo , readi shoulder respons , ” said adhikari .', '“ set special facil anim red panda chimpanze , ” said .', '“ snow leopard well . ” advoc keep anim zoo also said nepal snow leopard rang countri public , especi young gener , also need see differ anim found countri .', '“ great educ valu , ” said shah.snow leopard expert suryawanshi neighbour india also said would challeng releas anim wild .', '“ team zoo establish exact caus behaviour [ ventur plain ] keep anim away human contact , might okay releas back , ” said .', '“ otherwis , littl hope wild .', 'better let live zoo . ” back zoo , photojournalist done take photo , turn report point smartphon anim .', 'conting senior wildlif depart offici wait line catch glimps anim .', '“ much keep away human contact , ” conservationist observ hullabaloo distanc said.thi stori first appear mongabay onlinekhabar republish creativ common licenc .']"
Nepal beat Bangladesh on penalties to win FIFA International Women’s Football Series,"The National Assembly was formed to give experienced people a chance to be part of the parliament and help during the formation of important bills. In countries that follow the Westminster model of government, the upper house plays an important role. That, however, is not the case in Nepal as the country’s upper house has become a platform where individuals secure positions in the National Assembly based on their connections. As the election nears, many once again question the relevance and existence of the upper house.Things were different in the past as the initial years of the National Assembly saw experienced politicians and experts others in their field be nominated for the post. That slowly changed as the first batch completed its two-year term.“I understand why people are frustrated with the upper house. People expected experts but all we got was party cadres who lacked knowledge or experience,” says Bimala Rai Paudyal a National Assembly member. “Considering such behaviour and practices, what distinguishes the House of Representatives from the National Assembly?”A loser’s second chance Narayan Kaji Shrestha, who faced defeat in the 2017 general election from Gorkha-2, was elected as a member of the National Assembly on January 23, 2020. Elected from Gandaki Province, Shrestha currently is the Deputy Prime Minister and Home Minister of the country.Bhagwati Neupane who lost the election from Gandaki province and Bimala Ghimire who lost the election for mayorship in Bhanu Municipality also shared the same trajectory.Similarly, Mrigendra Kumar Singh Yadav and Jag Prasad Sharma were defeated in the House of Representatives elections, from Saptari-4 and Dang-3 respectively are now members of the National Assembly. Bam Dev Gautam, who lost the elections from Bardiya, secured a place in the upper house through nomination by President Bidya Devi Bhandari.Even those who did not win as ward member(s) got the opportunity to become members of the National Assembly including Sindh Bahadur Bishwakarma who was appointed on February 7, 2018. He is soon leaving his post on March 3.Despite the repeated criticisms, the political parties have not paid attention to this concern posed by political leaders and the general public. The latest proof of this is the list of candidates for the National Assembly elections scheduled on January 25. The list contains names like Krishna Prasad Sitaula, defeated in the House of Representatives elections in 2022 from Koshi Province, and Pooja Chaudhary, who lost in the provincial assembly elections 2022 from Rautahat-3 (a).Speaker Ganesh Prasad Timilsina, who led the National Assembly for the entire six years under the federal system, is also dissatisfied with the individuals who have made it to the upper house. “The allegations are something for the parties to ponder upon. The leaders should have prioritised involving intellectuals/neutrals rather than managing its members,” he says.The 59-member National Assembly elects eight representatives, equally from all seven provinces, with an additional three individuals nominated by the President. The Constitution ensures representation of women, Dalits, minorities or disabled communities, envisioning that experts, experienced individuals, and the most qualified people from various fields will become members of the National Assembly.Easy way inFile: A National Assembly meetingThere are some reasons why leaders aspire to join the upper house, and even the leadership create opportunities for them. In National Assembly elections, voters consist of local-level heads/deputy heads and provincial assembly members. Typically, individuals seeking these positions undergo a vetting process by their respective parties. As a result, aspiring members of parliament can focus less on persuading individual voters and more on gaining party support to secure their candidacy. Moreover, being a member of the National Assembly opens avenues to ministerial roles. The constitution prohibits a National Assembly member from becoming the Prime Minister, but not Deputy Prime Minister. Due to such opportunities, leaders are enticed to seek a position in the assembly.The National Assembly is currently in its fourth election cycle since the promulgation of the Consitution in 2015. Scheduled for January 25, this election aims to fill 19 seats vacated by individuals completing their six-year terms. The previous election cycles took place in 2017, involving 56 members, followed by 2019 with 18 positions, and 2020 with 19 positions.The cascading impactsFile: A National Assembly meetingAnother reason why the National Assembly is finding it difficult to justify itself is that it has become a shadow of the House of Representatives. The meeting of the National Assembly did not have one session when the House of Representatives was dissolved by then Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli twice. The demands and issues raised by the opposition parties in the House of Representatives automatically went to the National Assembly, where the parliamentarians of the ruling party put forward any proposal, they endorse it the same as in the House of Representatives.The latest example – is the main opposition UML did not allow the meeting of the House of Representatives to continue for five days from July 5, 2023, due to a statement made by Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal during his visit to India. Consequently, the meeting of the National Assembly was also paused during that period.The UML obstructed the House of Representatives for almost a month starting mid-July last year demanding a high-level inquiry committee to probe the 60-kilogram gold smuggling case and the resignation of the Home Minister. The National Assembly followed suit with leaders pushing their agendas forward.Speaker Ganesh Timilsina himself is dissatisfied that every behaviour and activity of the House of Representatives influence the National Assembly. He says despite his attempts to prevent the overshadowing, it has been unfortunate that he did not garner the goodwill of the top leaders during political disputes.Reinstating powerThe National Assembly is a permanent institution. Therefore, it can remain operational even in the absence of the House of Representatives. Under normal circumstances, Speaker Timilsina initiated a positive practice by personally participating in different committees. Nevertheless, in the absence of the House of Representatives, the National Assembly often experienced inactivity.In December 2020, the Prime Minister at that time, KP Sharma Oli, dissolved the House of Representatives. Subsequently, a session of the National Assembly was convened on January 1, 2021. Despite lasting only seven hours over four days, this session, which took place after the dissolution, failed to address crucial public issues. Even after six months, important matters remained unaddressed within the House.On May 22, 2021, the UML-led government once again dissolved the House of Representatives. The meeting of the National Assembly and committees was affected once more. However, the dissolutions were declared unconstitutional by the Supreme Court, reinstating the parliament.The Constitution says that despite the closing of the National Assembly session, thematic committee meetings can still take place. However, both the National Assembly and its committees remained inactive until the restoration of the House of Representatives.According to Khimlal Devkota, a member of the National Assembly, when the House of Representatives was dissolved twice, it seemed that the National Assembly was also in a state of dissolution.Bimala Rai Paudyal also believes that the inability to resume the upper house is a mark of weakness. “Since the government was not in a position to call, the President needed to be consulted by the chair together with the consultation committee. That was not done either,” she says.Constitutional and legal distinctionsExcept for the Constitution of Nepal (1962) and the Interim Constitution of Nepal (2007), all other constitutions in Nepal provided for a bicameral parliament with the National Assembly or the Upper House and the House of Representatives or the Lower House. The practices before 2015 were under the unitary governance system, but after the adoption of the federal democratic republican governance system, the role of the National Assembly has changed somewhat.In the preamble of the constitution prepared by the ‘Constituent Assembly, and Administrative Organ Designation Committee’ during the drafting of the constitution, it is mentioned that some different qualifications have been prescribed for being a member of the House of Representatives and the National Assembly, with the intention that qualified people can be represented in the National Assembly.Chair of the National Assembly Ganesh Prasad Timilsina restates that the members of the upper house should be assessed based on the country’s expectations with clear criteria. There is no definite definition of an expert in the constitution. It has been stated symbolically, “…It is expected that the members should have some basic skills to face the challenges and fulfil their responsibilities.”According to the constitution, the responsibility of the National Assembly is to correctly establish the rights of the local level, state, and union, and to prevent the House of Representatives from trying to enact laws contrary to the spirit of federalism. There is an explanatory comment in the constitution about the propriety of the National Assembly – “This House is expected to fulfil its role to maintain creative and mutual relations between the national government and the provinces.”In addition, there are some constitutional and legal differences regarding the National Assembly. But the MPs are demanding that it should cease. When a bill originating in the House of Representatives is passed and sent to the National Assembly, and if the latter does not decide within 60 days, it proceeds de facto.This has placed the National Assembly in a dilemma. The Chairman of the National Assembly, Timilsina, says, “Such an arrangement should also apply to the House of Representatives, or both should be equal.”Need for course correction PM Pushpa Kamal Dahal speaking in the National Assembly meeting.Some instances have turned these so-called experts into a laughing stock due to their actions. On July 5, 2023,  a discussion on the Electronic Commerce (E-Commerce) Bill 2023 was tabled in the National Assembly. However, the parliamentarians misunderstood the main point and instead discussed the matter of electricity. The MPs, who had not read the proposal, suggested that electricity consumption within Nepal should also be increased besides exporting electricity to India and Bangladesh.During the meeting, Ramesh Rijal, the Minister of Industry, Commerce and Supplies, also mentioned that India would purchase electricity during the Prime Minister’s visit. Unfortunately, the bill was unanimously approved.Timilsina considers the incident an example, that in his six-year tenure, he does not want to remember. Som Bahadur Thapa, a former secretary at the Parliament Secretariat, termed the incident ‘a joke’ in the Parliament of Nepal. “This is strong proof of the kind of MPs we have, who speak without knowing what they are talking about.” Timilsina assumed the role of the speaker/chair of the National Assembly after the establishment of the Federal Democratic Republic. He had the opportunity to establish the system and the dignity of the National Assembly. However, instead of setting a positive example, he will soon be retiring after being accused of playing tricks with the Speaker and showing interest in the work of the House of Representatives.Timilsina has repeatedly commented on the affairs of the House of Representatives. The latest instance was during a seminar on ‘Japan: Past, Present, and Future’ held in the capital on December 2, 2023, he publicly stated that the election results of the House of Representatives did not bode well.Pointing to the emergence of a new party and the victory of some independent candidates, he said, “In a democracy, you get to choose candidates, irrespective of their party affiliation. However, is the signal positive?”In August/ September 2022, Timilsina wrote a letter to the Election Commission, urging them to extend the tenure of Speaker and Deputy Speaker. Upon receiving a response stating that the Commission would not determine the tenure of the elected Parliament, Timilsina directed the Parliament Secretariat not to execute decisions made by the Management Committee after September 17, 2022.This created conflict between the Speaker of the House of Representatives and the Speaker of the National Assembly and in the crux of this dispute between the parties, the country had to bear the consequences of this conflict. Laws could not be enacted promptly, and the place once considered the domain of experts was overshadowed by the party’s interest. A study conducted by the Democracy Resource Center Nepal (DRCN) on the legislative functioning of the National Assembly has revealed that the Upper House has passed some bills that go against the spirit of federalism.The report’s concluding remarks say, “…the bills passed by the House of Representatives have not undergone significant changes or discussions in the National Assembly. The conclusion section of the study states that – “Furthermore, some bills, contradicting the spirit of federalism and addressing the interests of interest groups, have been approved by the National Assembly.”Overall, in the last six years, parties have introduced individuals who, given their presentation level, have raised questions about the National Assembly’s justification. If there are no changes in the constitution, laws, and policies concerning the upper assembly, these concerns will persist.”",['nepal beat bangladesh penalti win fifa intern women ’ footbal

3 volleyball players suspended for laying hands on spectators,"Representational image Photo by Tanushree Rao on UnsplashWhile most of the nation was preparing for the festival of lights, Tihar in early November 2023, something no less exciting was fuelling our sparks from oceans away. A queer art festival was happening for the seventeenth year and we had a chance to attend it as delegates. Our delegation was made possible through the collaboration between the Outburst Arts, an art organisation based in Northern Ireland, UK and the British Council, Nepal.There is a clear distinction between cities in terms of their flourishing arts scenes, and this became apparent during a visit to Belfast, Northern Ireland, specifically for the Outburst Queer Arts Festival held in the charming city centre. The organisation of such a festival requires months of careful preparation and planning.The queer art festival started as short events lasting a few days. Now, after 17 years, it has grown into a ten-day festival with panel discussions, theatre performances, and exhibitions. Program guides were available at venues, partner hotels, local libraries, and shops. Many delegates, including us, came from outside Northern Ireland to attend.During the queer art festival, we had the opportunity to connect with art curators, publishers, artists, and representatives from other British Council departments around the world (Lithuania, France, South Africa, Turkey, Greece, Jordan, England, and Argentina to name a few.) Each event that we attended gave us a different insight into what the arts can do and how it can facilitate connections. We gained insights from queer publishers and art curators on the challenges they face in their own countries due to resources and sometimes from bureaucracy in systems. We also got to see the way people can thrive when given a platform to showcase their works, such as an art exhibition in which the artist reimagined intimacy for queer people.On the other hand, Nepal struggles by and large at times for queer visibility. There are no explicit spaces for SOGIESC (Sexual Orientation, Gender Identity and Expressions and Sex Characteristics) artists to showcase their works nor openly come together as a community, it all exists in pocket spaces. In the same way, something that struck us was the presence of older queer artists at the festival. It was not just for one particular event during the queer art festival. We noticed an active participation and involvement of older queer people throughout the festival there. It was fascinating to see queer artists in their 40s and 50s share their transformative and inspiring work. Whereas, back home, the queer folks at the forefront of queer art, advocacy and activism are mostly Gen-Zs and millennials. We have very few queer elders that we can count on our fingers who are diligently working for Nepali queer folks. Even among them, some still hold onto archaic notions and refuse to evolve and embrace changes. So, there’s that.From dream to realityDuring the queer art festival, we had the opportunity to connect with art curators, publishers and artists. Photo by Raphael Renter | @raphi_rawr on UnsplashBefore being selected as delegates, both of us joined online meetings with British Council Nepal and the Outburst representatives facilitated through Kaalo 101 (an art space in Patan), along with interested queer artists from Nepal. We had a total of three meetings where we discussed the possibilities and challenges of doing a queer art festival in Nepal. The discourse also entailed us sharing a presentation about the updates of the queer art scene in Nepal in the last five years. The updates included memorable leaps taken in queer arts from music to literature and fashion and more by artists from diverse walks of life. Days after the third meeting, the British Council extended invitations to us to attend the Outburst Queer Arts Festival.Our delegation is just one example of the transcontinental collaboration because it was something that happened for the first time and involved us. But, Outburst Arts and the British Council have been practising cross-continental collaboration for years. Even in this year’s festival, we witnessed a lot of artists from different continents work together in exhibitions, lectures, panel discussions, magazines and so on. The amalgamation introduced us to brilliant thought-provoking work that defies gender and sociopolitical norms. The power of transcontinental collaboration was beyond beautiful.Imagining queer arts in NepalPhoto by Nikolas Gannon on UnsplashThe queer art scene in Nepal is an emerging one. While a full-fledged festival may not be possible now, something small yet significant is achievable. Time and again, different organisations have been running large art exhibitions/tours for weeks and months. However, in the microcosm that is Nepal, especially Kathmandu, the capital is no stranger to art-oriented programs. What it has been unfamiliar with precisely is queer art. And the unfamiliarity is not something induced by the lack of queer artists and their art. Sadly, it is because of inadequate platforms, space and resources to pursue queer arts.Despite this, through the years there have been events and literature that have emerged centring on queer identity, but it has not come without its challenges. On collections of stories, “Pride Climbing Higher” and “Songs of Revolution” showcase stories from Nepalis across Nepal. There are not many stories reflecting the Nepali queer experiences otherwise. June Pride Parade by Queer Youth Group has gained momentum as well in the past few years since its conception, from a small gathering to now a large parade with performances from community members. The same can be said about Blue Diamond Society’s (BDS) Rainbow Visibility Pride events in August during the festival of Saa-Paru (Gai Jatra) which has been running for well over a decade; in recent years they have included flash mobs and interaction programmes as well in lead up to their parade. Individuals within the community have also organised their queer gatherings with friends, thus coming back to the cosmos of pocket spaces in celebrating queerness.While artists like us are creative with what we want to put out, we still need organisations like the British Council to foster spaces and connections to enable us to do that. Then and again, artists have come together and collaborated on queer-centric projects. But, we need funding and resources to achieve bigger-scale projects that unite more artists and transcend borders.Both of us advocate for queer rights and are involved in programs and activities that push the narrative further, extend the visibility of the community and normalise conversations surrounding queerness. Among other things, we are also the founders of Queering The Bond, a networking collective for Nepali queer folks and Shuby is also the founder of Queer Honky-Tonk, a platform to promote queer performances and networking with events such as a drag show or open mic every few months. However, both of us, individually or collaboratively can only do so much. The challenges of living in a capitalistic world oftentimes outweigh the passion we have for the queer art scene in Nepal. And this is where we expect the government and organisations to step up with policies, platforms and programs to provide spaces, opportunities and resources for queer artists. Here, the British Council joined hands with Outburst Arts, which paved the way for our delegation. We would not have known about the marvellous queer art festival at the other end of the world otherwise.Besides the limitations brought by insufficient spaces and social unawareness, the centralised capital does hinder queer artists from outside the city to connect, create and collaborate. Art already is centralised and elitist. On top of that, the concentrated Kathmandu Valley is of no help when it comes to making art accessible beyond its borders.Furthermore, there is also the expectation from basically everyone to have the perfect festival that caters to all people’s needs and wants. While the festival, if it should happen, is bound to be done with the right intentions, there is a lot of pressure for the first-time event itself. The festival will be inclusive and diverse. But, realistically speaking, it would be a struggle to make it relevant to each queer person from east to west.Speaking of struggles, a visceral feeling of uneasiness swarmed over me with each step I took while exiting the airport after the flight back home. I, Birat, personally felt that I could not be as free or unrestrained in Nepal as I was during my time in Belfast. No wonder a lot of the queer people we know opt for abroad.Seventeen years ago, when the Outburst Queer Arts Festival first began, it certainly was not as celebrated or large as it is now. What we are trying to convey here is that we do not have to start big. We can aim for something small yet promising. While there might be expectations to check all the boxes, it is crucial to be mindful of our capacity as well. But, we can be capacitated and this is where you – people in power, art enthusiasts, grant and resource allocators and media come in. It is time we all believe in Nepali queer art and create space for it to not only survive but thrive. It is imperative to understand that formulating our imagination into reality can only be possible through unwavering collaboration.",['3 volleybal player suspend lay hand spectat'],"['represent imag photo tanushre rao unsplashwhil nation prepar festiv light , tihar earli novemb 2023 , someth less excit fuell spark ocean away .', 'queer art festiv happen seventeenth year chanc attend deleg .', 'deleg made possibl collabor outburst art , art organis base northern ireland , uk british council , nepal.ther clear distinct citi term flourish art scene , becam appar visit belfast , northern ireland , specif outburst queer art festiv held charm citi centr .', 'organis festiv requir month care prepar planning.th queer art festiv start short event last day .', ', 17 year , grown ten-day festiv panel discuss , theatr perform , exhibit .', 'program guid avail venu , partner hotel , local librari , shop .', 'mani deleg , includ us , came outsid northern ireland attend.dur queer art festiv , opportun connect art curat , publish , artist , repres british council depart around world ( lithuania , franc , south africa , turkey , greec , jordan , england , argentina name . )', 'event attend gave us differ insight art facilit connect .', 'gain insight queer publish art curat challeng face countri due resourc sometim bureaucraci system .', 'also got see way peopl thrive given platform showcas work , art exhibit artist reimagin intimaci queer people.on hand , nepal struggl larg time queer visibl .', 'explicit space sogiesc ( sexual orient , gender ident express sex characterist ) artist showcas work openli come togeth commun , exist pocket space .', 'way , someth struck us presenc older queer artist festiv .', 'one particular event queer art festiv .', 'notic activ particip involv older queer peopl throughout festiv .', 'fascin see queer artist 40 50 share transform inspir work .', 'wherea , back home , queer folk forefront queer art , advocaci activ mostli gen-z millenni .', 'queer elder count finger dilig work nepali queer folk .', 'even among , still hold onto archaic notion refus evolv embrac chang .', ', ’ that.from dream realitydur queer art festiv , opportun connect art curat , publish artist .', 'photo raphael renter | @ raphi_rawr unsplashbefor select deleg , us join onlin meet british council nepal outburst repres facilit kaalo 101 ( art space patan ) , along interest queer artist nepal .', 'total three meet discuss possibl challeng queer art festiv nepal .', 'discours also entail us share present updat queer art scene nepal last five year .', 'updat includ memor leap taken queer art music literatur fashion artist divers walk life .', 'day third meet , british council extend invit us attend outburst queer art festival.our deleg one exampl transcontinent collabor someth happen first time involv us .', ', outburst art british council practis cross-continent collabor year .', 'even year ’ festiv , wit lot artist differ contin work togeth exhibit , lectur , panel discuss , magazin .', 'amalgam introduc us brilliant thought-provok work defi gender sociopolit norm .', 'power transcontinent collabor beyond beautiful.imagin queer art nepalphoto nikola gannon unsplashth queer art scene nepal emerg one .', 'full-fledg festiv may possibl , someth small yet signific achiev .', 'time , differ organis run larg art exhibitions/tour week month .', 'howev , microcosm nepal , especi kathmandu , capit stranger art-ori program .', 'unfamiliar precis queer art .', 'unfamiliar someth induc lack queer artist art .', 'sadli , inadequ platform , space resourc pursu queer arts.despit , year event literatur emerg centr queer ident , come without challeng .', 'collect stori , “ pride climb higher ” “ song revolut ” showcas stori nepali across nepal .', 'mani stori reflect nepali queer experi otherwis .', 'june pride parad queer youth group gain momentum well past year sinc concept , small gather larg parad perform commun member .', 'said blue diamond societi ’ ( bd ) rainbow visibl pride event august festiv saa-paru ( gai jatra ) run well decad ;

Tyson Moktan: The powerlifting pioneer in the country wants to pave the way for the future,"The month of January saw major road accidents in different parts of the country, including Lamhi in Dang, Dhorpatan in Baglung, and Chandragiri in Kathmandu. Road accidents have been common throughout the country with Nepal Police data suggesting over 2,500 people dying in them annually. Despite this, the Ministry of Finance has shown reluctance to introduce the proposed Road Safety Bill to reduce traffic accidents, fatalities, and serious injuries, and enhance road safety. Instead, the Finance Ministry has asked the Ministry of Physical Infrastructure and Transport to include the proposed bill in the Public Roads Act. Along with that, the government’s initiative to pass dedicated laws on road safety and set up a mechanism, including the empowered National Road Safety Council (NRSC), to decrease accidents, has come to a halt.Keshav Kumar Sharma, secretary of the Ministry of Physical Infrastructure and Transport, says they asked for a dedicated road safety law that comprehensively addresses institutional arrangements was the need of the hour. This includes ensuring safety in road construction, promoting public awareness, providing training and communication facilities, implementing rescue mechanisms, and arranging rehabilitation for families affected by road accidents. However, the Ministry of Finance believes a separate law is unnecessary due to concerns about potential increased financial burden.Hourly needOfficials from the Ministry of Physical Infrastructure allege that the Ministry of Finance is approaching sensitive matters, such as passenger safety, solely from an economic standpoint. They say that concerns related to road, vehicle, and passenger safety are being overshadowed, and there are indications that this approach will continue. “The government is avoiding addressing the sensitive issue of road accidents and the associated human and material costs, fearing an increase in expenses. This contradicts the government’s commitment and policy to reduce traffic accidents in the future,” says an official from the Ministry of Physical Infrastructure on the condition of anonymity.According to the Ministry of Physical Infrastructure, the existing laws lack the vision and purpose necessary for developing a sustainable, safe, risk-free, and reliable transportation operation and security system. Therefore, the Ministry of Physical Infrastructure officials argue that a distinct law is essential to decrease road accidents and ensure the safety of pedestrians, including passenger transport workers and roadside residents, as well as pets, wild animals, and birds. “The Road Safety Act is the need of the hour as it will help us during post-accident rescue, treatment management, rehabilitation, and legal representation,” says the official.Currently, there are gaps in enforcing road rules, monitoring vehicle capacities, ensuring road structure safety, managing traffic signs, and organizing road safety facilities. The implementation of the Road Safety Act is seen as crucial to address these issues.However, there has not been a facilitative environment for providing education and raising awareness about road traffic safety, safety mechanisms, and coordinating among organisations related to road transport. The aspect of training drivers with skills and knowledge, as well as monitoring road safety on the roads, is also lacking. This is why experts have been suggesting introducing a separate road safety law to address these aspects.The Finance Ministry, however, says that road safety should not be downplayed by ignoring human sensibilities related to road safety and citing economic reasons. Officials from the Ministry of Physical Infrastructure argue that incorporating safety considerations in the Road Act does not automatically result in a decrease in accidents or the integration of post-accident rescue, relief, and rehabilitation efforts.“The existing laws do not address road safety anywhere. Due to its lack of clarity and inadequacy, it has not been implemented with due diligence. For instance, provisions such as those for vehicle inspectors outlined in the Transport Act have not been acted upon by the government,” says an official from the Transport Ministry.Policies and commitments, but no lawsThe Motor Vehicles and Transport Management Act (1993) includes several provisions related to vehicle registration, road permits, driver’s licenses, traffic management, insurance, and penalties. The Public Roads Act (1974) primarily focuses on road management. However, there is no provision in the Act regarding the National Road Safety Council.In this situation, Nepal has developed a 10-year road safety action plan but is yet to enact corresponding legislation. Unfortunately, government agencies and mechanisms are not obligated to follow the action plan, as it lacks legal guidance.Now, the Transport Ministry holds the view that if safety considerations are explicitly addressed in the Public Roads Act, the outcome will not differ from what the Finance Ministry has said. Given the Public Roads Act’s close association with the Department of Road, the ministry thinks greater emphasis will be placed on road construction. However, they argue that incorporating the road safety aspect into the Act would not be effective.Secretary Sharma of the Transport Ministry is tasked with ensuring road safety, overseeing physical infrastructure and transport, and coordinating efforts across education, health, home, law, federal affairs, and general administration ministries. This responsibility extends to provincial ministries, local levels, as well as various agencies, organisations, security agencies, non-governmental organisations, and related entities, each with their specific roles.“As all the agencies need to be allocated responsibilities for various aspects of road safety, we have requested them to collaborate in formulating a distinct law. This should encompass the reduction of all types of accidents,” said Sharma.The ministry believes that a dedicated law addressing road safety is crucial to mitigate severe road accidents in Nepal and to uphold the commitments made by the country on the international stage.Nepal has committed to implementing the Stockholm Declaration through the Global Road Traffic Safety Conference in 2020, as per the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. Nepal, which has incorporated sustainable development goals into its national development plan, has not yet commenced work aligned with these objectives.Nevertheless, Nepal’s neighbouring countries are already addressing road safety through legal frameworks. Various states in India have enacted road safety laws, and the effectiveness of these laws is contributing to a 50 per cent reduction in road accidents.In 1999, Bhutan also introduced a unified road safety and transport act. Pakistan, on the other hand, issued the National Highway Safety Ordinance-2000 to ensure road safety, distinct from its National Highway Authority Act (1991). Britain, Australia, America, New Zealand, and other countries have established separate road safety laws as well.Road safety neglectedIn Nepal, road safety has been consistently neglected due to the absence of dedicated legislation. Road safety expert Keshav Adhikari says that the government primarily focused on road construction, overlooks crucial aspects such as road safety and reinforcement. Consequently, roads are transforming into perilous pathways for both vehicles and passengers.“There is a lack of interest in formulating policies and laws aimed at mitigating financial losses resulting from accidents,” says Adhikari.He further points out that safety is not a governmental priority, as expanding the road network is perceived to yield more political benefits than implementing additional structures to enhance road safety.“When I worked as an expert in the Transport Ministry for over a year, I realised that promoting road safety is not a government priority,” he says. “Annually, more people die due to road accidents than those who die in natural disasters, but the government has not given it much attention.”Even though the prime minister, ministers, and MPs keep asserting that roads have been constructed, no one seems to be addressing the critical issues of road safety and quality.Saroj Sitaula, General Secretary of the Federation of Nepalese National Transport Entrepreneurs (FNNTE), says that the government must be attentive as accidents are on the rise due to various technical and human factors, including road infrastructure. “Many accidents can be mitigated by improving road conditions, installing barriers on the sides, putting up informational boards, and ensuring scientific and practical road markings,” he says. “We need to formulate a plan and progress accordingly.”Sitaula argues that the government should establish policies to create mechanisms for emergency rescue, treatment, and rehabilitation after an accident occurs. He emphasises the importance of enhancing road infrastructure, conducting a scientific examination of the technical condition of vehicles, and ensuring compliance with the law by drivers, passengers, and regulators. He says that blaming drivers and transport entrepreneurs for accidents is inadequate, and the government must fulfil its responsibilities.Roads are unsafeNepal currently boasts a road network spanning approximately 100,000 km, with the majority consisting of dirt and gravel roads. Among the more than 22,000 kilometres of national and subsidiary highways, numerous sections remain unpaved.Despite the government’s substantial investment in road construction and expansion, minimal efforts are allocated to ensuring road safety. Recently, all three levels of government have accelerated the widening of roads, incorporating asphalt and slopes. However, it appears that issues concerning road quality and safety are escalating at a faster pace. Roads that have been neglected in the guise of maintenance have become a nightmare for the public.Infrastructure expert Suryaraj Acharya notes that these problems arise due to the tendency to construct roads only after they have sustained damage, without considering potential issues during the initial construction phase.",['tyson moktan : powerlift pioneer countri want pave way

The series includes the Realme 12 Pro 5G and the Realme 12 Pro+ 5G which are the successors of the Realme 11 Pro+ 5G and Realme 11 Pro 5G respectively. The Realme 11 series was widely appreciated for its design and performance at the price range. The 12 series has stepped up the game with an even better design. Realme has not only changed the design but has also upgraded the performance and the camera to compete in the mid-range price market. Realme recently has been focusing a lot on the design aspect and the price range performance. The 12 Pro+ has some major differences from last year’s 11 Pro+ which include design, IP rating, chipset, camera and charging. Let us see what the luxuriously designed smartphone delivers in terms of specs.Specifications of Realme 12 Pro+ 5GDimensionsLength: 161.47mmWidth: 74.02mmDepth: 8.75mmWeight196 gramsDisplay typeAMOLEDDisplay size6.7-inchResolution2,412 x 1,080 (FHD+)Refresh rateUp to 120HzIP ratingIP65 dust and water resistance Glass Protection0.55mm Double-Reinforced GlassChipsetSnapdragon 7s Gen 2 (4nm)CPUOcta-core (4×2.40 GHz Cortex-A78 & 4×1.95 GHz Cortex-A55)GPUAdreno 710OSRealme UI 5.0 based on Android 14RAM8GB | 12GBStorage128GB | 256GBRear camera 50MP Sony IMX890 main camera8MP ultra-wide camera64MP periscope portrait cameraSelfie camera32MP Wi-Fi802.11 a/b/g/n/ac/ax（Wi-Fi 6）Bluetooth5.2NetworkLTE | 5GSIMDual Nano SIMAudioDual SpeakersSupports Dolby AtmosDual-mic Noise CancellationHi-Res Audio CertificationSensorsGeomagnetic sensor, Proximity sensor, Light sensor, Acceleration sensor, Gyroscope, In-display fingerprint sensorBattery5,000mAh (typ)Charging67W SUPERVOOC wired fast chargingPorts and Buttons2 Nano SIM Card SlotsType-C PortPower ButtonVolume ButtonsColoursSubmarine BlueNavigator BeigeExplorer RedPrice (expected)Rs 50,000 (8/128GB)Rs 54,000 (8/256GB)Rs 60,000 (12/256GB)Design and DisplayThe Realme 12 Pro+ and the Realme 12 Pro share the same design and dimensions. The design is fascinating. Realme patterned up with Luxury Swiss Watch designer Ollivier Savéo to craftfully design the smartphone. All the colour options have a vegan leather back. Since the phone is designed by a luxury watch designer, it comes with a big round camera module housing the triple camera setup. There is a golden 3D Jubilee Bracelet which gives the texture of a luxury watch strap. A golden patterned line runs through the middle and around the camera module for an even better look.Realme 12 Pro+ 5G designer Ollivier Savéo.

Women in sports management can make a difference ,"Ram Bujhaun Yadav with his land ownership certificate stands near a border pillar which he says was erroneously placed on his land. In October 2023, when 51-year-old Ram Bujhaun Yadav of Musaharnia Rural Municipality-5, Mukhiyapatti, Dhanusha, was at a relative’s house, someone told him that two Indian Sashastra Seema Bal (SSB) personnel were looking for him.Anxious, he rushed home wondering why they were looking for him.“They asked me if the paddy field in the no man’s land was mine. I told them yes and they asked me to cut down the paddy immediately,” he said.The paddy was not ripe and Yadav asked them for some time. However, the SSB personnel told him he had to cut down his paddy immediately.Ram Bujhaun and his wife Tetari Devi each own a 677-square-metre plot of land. As Nepal and India reevaluated the border, Ram Bujhan’s land was been deemed to be near the no man’s land as it now has two demarcation pillars.Frustrated, Ram Bujhaun cut the paddy before it was due to be harvested. Now, he has been asked to not plant anything on the land as it falls in the no man’s land.“Our border police don’t say a word. I can’t fight the SSB on my own,” says Ram Bujhaun adding he had decided not to plan anything on the land anymore.Woes of the farmersMany farmers in southern Nepal say their land has now been placed in India after the recent demarcation. When the Jamuna River, which flows through the no man’s land between Nepal and India, changed its course some two decades ago, some border pillars went missing. Locals say these pillars have now been placed encroaching on Nepali land.In 2018, with the then Chief District Officer of Dhanusha, Pradeep Raj Kandel, and an official from Madhubani district, Bihar, India, a team that included border security forces from both countries, the Armed Police Force of Nepal, and SSB of India began placing border pillars after land measurement by technicians.Locals have raised concerns, stating that border pillars have been positioned, encroaching approximately 50 to 100 meters of land into Nepal compared to the previous position. Many like Ram Bujhaun are unaware of when these border pillars were placed.“I did not know that pillar was placed here. After I found out when I asked the village leaders, many said they were placing the border pillars as they pleased,” said Ram Bujhaun.He was told to carry on planting paddy and that it would not matter as these issues had happened in the past. “They encroached on my land and have asked me not to plant anything. This is gross injustice,” he says.Ram Bujhaun’s family owns a total of 4,000 square metres of land, with 2,000 square metres belonging to him and the remaining 2,000 square metres to his brother Bechan. However, 1,000 square metres of his land is now located on the Indian side after the demarcation. Despite this, he has been farming on the land and continues to pay taxes to the Department of Land Management and Archive in Nepal.“They have marked my land to be on the Indian side and placed border pillars on it. I’ve been farming till now but I don’t know when they will ask me to stop,” he says.Ignorance of the governmentThe Madhesh province in southern NepalThe former ward chair of Mukhiyapatti Musharniya Rural Municipality-5, Ram Naresh Yadav, said that over time, India has encroached on numerous Nepali lands in various locations in the Madhesh Province. This, he says, happened due to the Nepali administration’s ignorance and weak stature.“They (Nepali administration) were careless and that meant the Indian side placed these border pillars by encroaching on Nepali land,” says Ram Naresh.He said that over 40 farmers from wards 1, 5, and 6 have land ranging from 300 to 1,600 square metres on the Indian side. “These farmers have land ownership certificates, but they cannot farm as the SSB says the land is in India and not Nepal,” said Ram Naresh.In 1996, land ownership certificates were distributed after surveying the land in the border area. Local Dharmendra Kumar Yadav said that since then, the locals have been paying their land tax regularly. In 2018, when the pillar was being placed, the locals protested when they saw their land was being encroached on. However, since the demarcation had been agreed upon by high-ranking government officials of Nepal and India, the farmer’s voices went unheard.“We tried to stop when the border pillars were being placed on our land. But the administrators from both sides forcibly put it there without even trying to hold a discussion,” said Harish Chandra Yadav. The Chief District Officer of Dhanusha, Chakrapani Pandey, says that the border pillars were placed by the technical team after the measurements and with the agreement of the high-ranking officials of the two countries.“The fields and houses that are built in no man’s land have recently been cleared. No one can do anything in this particular area,” said Pandey. “We understand the people’s concern but we cannot do anything about it now.”",['women sport manag make differ'],"['ram bujhaun yadav land ownership certif stand near border pillar say erron place land .', 'octob 2023 , 51-year-old ram bujhaun yadav musaharnia rural municipality-5 , mukhiyapatti , dhanusha , rel ’ hous , someon told two indian sashastra seema bal ( ssb ) personnel look him.anxi , rush home wonder look him . “ ask paddi field man ’ land mine .', 'told ye ask cut paddi immedi , ” said.th paddi ripe yadav ask time .', 'howev , ssb personnel told cut paddi immediately.ram bujhaun wife tetari devi 677-square-metr plot land .', 'nepal india reevalu border , ram bujhan ’ land deem near man ’ land two demarc pillars.frustr , ram bujhaun cut paddi due harvest .', ', ask plant anyth land fall man ’ land . “ border polic ’ say word .', '’ fight ssb , ” say ram bujhaun ad decid plan anyth land anymore.wo farmersmani farmer southern nepal say land place india recent demarc .', 'jamuna river , flow man ’ land nepal india , chang cours two decad ago , border pillar went miss .', 'local say pillar place encroach nepali land.in 2018 , chief district offic dhanusha , pradeep raj kandel , offici madhubani district , bihar , india , team includ border secur forc countri , arm polic forc nepal , ssb india began place border pillar land measur technicians.loc rais concern , state border pillar posit , encroach approxim 50 100 meter land nepal compar previou posit .', 'mani like ram bujhaun unawar border pillar place . “ know pillar place .', 'found ask villag leader , mani said place border pillar pleas , ” said ram bujhaun.h told carri plant paddi would matter issu happen past .', '“ encroach land ask plant anyth .', 'gross injustic , ” says.ram bujhaun ’ famili own total 4,000 squar metr land , 2,000 squar metr belong remain 2,000 squar metr brother bechan .', 'howev , 1,000 squar metr land locat indian side demarc .', 'despit , farm land continu pay tax depart land manag archiv nepal . “ mark land indian side place border pillar .', '’ farm till ’ know ask stop , ” says.ignor governmentth madhesh provinc southern nepalth former ward chair mukhiyapatti musharniya rural municipality-5 , ram naresh yadav , said time , india encroach numer nepali land variou locat madhesh provinc .', ', say , happen due nepali administr ’ ignor weak statur . “ ( nepali administr ) careless meant indian side place border pillar encroach nepali land , ” say ram naresh.h said 40 farmer ward 1 , 5 , 6 land rang 300 1,600 squar metr indian side .', '“ farmer land ownership certif , farm ssb say land india nepal , ” said ram naresh.in 1996 , land ownership certif distribut survey land border area .', 'local dharmendra kumar yadav said sinc , local pay land tax regularli .', '2018 , pillar place , local protest saw land encroach .', 'howev , sinc demarc agre upon high-rank govern offici nepal india , farmer ’ voic went unheard . “ tri stop border pillar place land .', 'administr side forcibl put without even tri hold discuss , ” said harish chandra yadav .', 'chief district offic dhanusha , chakrapani pandey , say border pillar place technic team measur agreement high-rank offici two countri . “ field hous built man ’ land recent clear .', 'one anyth particular area , ” said pandey .', '“ understand peopl ’ concern anyth . ”']"
Priyam Pradhan explores the essence of money and life in ‘Mani’ ,"Photo by pippen on UnsplashLife is filled with surprises and unexpected events and it can change at any moment. The only thing certain in life is the uncertainty. Change is a natural and inevitable part of our lives, and it may be positive as well as negative.Even though it is not guaranteed that we will wake up in the morning, we set the alarm every night with the hope that we will wake up in the morning. We do not know what each day is going to bring us, but we may have varieties, adventures, and endless opportunities.The push to exploreThe uncertainty sometimes forces us to explore those aspects of life, we never knew existed or needed. It also tests the mental strength of people and how they deal with it. The uncertainty has taught me to be grateful, as we never know what life throws at us.In life, everything does not go according to our plans, and if we do not embrace the change we will face huge trouble. The Covid-19 pandemic is the best example of uncertainty, we were constantly fearing death and it was uncertain that we would see the sunrise the next day.It is not certain that every decision in life will be correct, but if you fear not trying at all, you miss endless opportunities for learning and growing. When our decisions or outcomes are on the negative side, we get depressed and we might tend to think about committing suicide, but we forget that if we have life we have endless opportunities. Most of us plan for our careers, our love life, etc. and when those plans do not work out we start getting uncomfortable. But if we can deal with today, we can surely deal with tomorrow. We need to cherish little moments in our lives and know that nothing is permanent not even the failures and setbacks.We come here with nothing and leave with nothing. So why should we hold the egos and grudges against each other? Instead of making our life meaningful and enjoying the journey of life, we get into puzzles of accumulating wealth and we go against our own loved ones for it. Change is certainPhoto by Kathyryn Tripp on UnsplashNothing is permanent in life, everything can change in fractions of seconds. In today’s society, everyone is so busy, that we people have so less time for our loved ones. What I have learned over the years, is to find time in our busy schedule for our family because we never know when it will be our last day together with them. Yes! Death is a natural process, so if you have to die someday, why should you die with grudges in your heart? But instead of worrying about the inevitable, focusing on the things you can control will bring a lot of happiness in life.Uncertainty is not only a negative thing; it also brings a lot of opportunity because you dare to change. The life-changing experience will not come knocking down your door, you need to expose yourself. We learn by doing and experimenting, even though we might fail. But that is not the end of the world. I still remember hesitating while applying for the role of leadership, at my school level as it was not certain that I would be chosen.Even after being selected, I was uncertain about whether I could fulfil my responsibilities or not. But that uncertainty helped me grow out of my comfort zone and give my best input. If I had not applied for that role just because I was uncertain of the outcome, I would miss the biggest learning opportunity in my school life. So, do not let the uncertainty or the unknown ever stop you from trying and no matter how much we try, to plan life always finds a way to surprise us. It is important to stay grounded when we have everything we wish for because life can take such a turn that we had never expected in our wildest dreams. Similarly, nothing is permanent in life, the financial hardships, the grades, the breakups, etc. But the most important thing is not to lose hope during those difficult times.According to the data provided by Nepal police, around 6,830 people took their lives in the fiscal year 2022/23. There is nothing in life that cannot be resolved although it may take time, committing suicide should not be an option. It’s important to share feelings among family members or loved ones because together as a family any problem can be overcome.Embrace the unknown and focus on enhancing your life, instead of worrying about what will happen next. Always find time for your loved ones, as life is uncertain. We should be grateful that we are alive and accept that change is the only constant thing in life. Do not let the unknown, stop you from trying or achieving your goals and always remember that even if you fail, you still have endless opportunities.",['priyam pradhan explor essenc money life ‘ mani ’'],"['photo pippen unsplashlif fill surpris unexpect event chang moment .', 'thing certain life uncertainti .', 'chang natur inevit part live , may posit well negative.even though guarante wake morn , set alarm everi night hope wake morn .', 'know day go bring us , may varieti , adventur , endless opportunities.th push exploreth uncertainti sometim forc us explor aspect life , never knew exist need .', 'also test mental strength peopl deal .', 'uncertainti taught grate , never know life throw us.in life , everyth go accord plan , embrac chang face huge troubl .', 'covid-19 pandem best exampl uncertainti , constantli fear death uncertain would see sunris next day.it certain everi decis life correct , fear tri , miss endless opportun learn grow .', 'decis outcom neg side , get depress might tend think commit suicid , forget life endless opportun .', 'us plan career , love life , etc .', 'plan work start get uncomfort .', 'deal today , sure deal tomorrow .', 'need cherish littl moment live know noth perman even failur setbacks.w come noth leav noth .', 'hold ego grudg ?', 'instead make life meaning enjoy journey life , get puzzl accumul wealth go love one .', 'chang certainphoto kathyryn tripp unsplashnoth perman life , everyth chang fraction second .', 'today ’ societi , everyon busi , peopl less time love one .', 'learn year , find time busi schedul famili never know last day togeth .', 'ye !', 'death natur process , die someday , die grudg heart ?', 'instead worri inevit , focus thing control bring lot happi life.uncertainti neg thing ; also bring lot opportun dare chang .', 'life-chang experi come knock door , need expos .', 'learn experi , even though might fail .', 'end world .', 'still rememb hesit appli role leadership , school level certain would chosen.even select , uncertain whether could fulfil respons .', 'uncertainti help grow comfort zone give best input .', 'appli role uncertain outcom , would miss biggest learn opportun school life .', ', let uncertainti unknown ever stop tri matter much tri , plan life alway find way surpris us .', 'import stay ground everyth wish life take turn never expect wildest dream .', 'similarli , noth perman life , financi hardship , grade , breakup , etc .', 'import thing lose hope difficult times.accord data provid nepal polic , around 6,830 peopl took live fiscal year 2022/23 .', 'noth life resolv although may take time , commit suicid option .', '’ import share feel among famili member love one togeth famili problem overcome.embrac unknown focu enhanc life , instead worri happen next .', 'alway find time love one , life uncertain .', 'grate aliv accept chang constant thing life .', 'let unknown , stop tri achiev goal alway rememb even fail , still endless opportun .']"
Role of entrepreneurship education in Nepal’s quest for economic empowerment ,"Aayush Kunwar will represent Nepal in his first international race. Aayush Kunwar, 28, of Sanfebagar in Achham is excited. The six-foot-tall athlete will represent Nepal in the 100-200m events at the Asian Athletics Championships. The championship is scheduled from July 12 to July 16 in Bangkok. Along with Kunwar, six other Nepali athletes — Shiva Raj Parki, Som Bahadur Kumal, Mukesh Pal, Dipak Adhikari, Fulmati Rana and Raj Pura Pachhai — have also been selected for the championship.   Onlinekhabar recently caught up with Kunwar. In a conversation, he shared his expectation from the global championship, achievements, and challenges of athletes in Nepal among others. Excerpt:Is this your first international race?Yes.Could you share with us how it all happened? I was called for a trial by the coaches for the selection of Asian Athletics. After the trial, coaches selected a group of athletes and I was also included in that selection. Almost all athletes dream to represent their country in global competitions and it’s no exception for me. I had been trying for such an opportunity for a long time, and now the dream has finally come true. How is the training session going? The training is going well. Our practice begins at 7 am every day under the supervision of national coaches. We practice according to the category that we are selected for in the Asian Athletics Championships. We engage in practice sessions at least three to four days a week, primarily focusing on running drills on the racing track. On the remaining days, we dedicate our training sessions to strength workouts at the gym.Since it will be your first time in an international event, what are your expectations?Realistically speaking, Nepal faces challenges in sprint events when compared to countries like China and Japan. However, as an athlete, I was to break the current national record of electronic time which is 10.71 seconds in the 100 metres and 21.95 seconds in the 200 metres. Since 1990 no one has beaten this record. I believe all the Nepali athletes participating in Asian Athletics Championships have a goal to beat the national record. Aayush Kunwar says his aim is to break the national records in both the 100m and 200m events. How did you get into athletics?I have been a sports enthusiast since childhood. I was interested in football, table tennis and basketball and the base of every sport is athletics. In 2012, I was studying at Budhanilkantha School and I represented my school in the 200m and 400m races and the long jump in President Running Shield. Getting a chance to run in Dasarath Rangasala was huge for me. I won gold medals in the 200m and 400m race and the long jump in the under 18 category. Likewise, I was also announced as the best athlete. Afterwards, members of departmental teams showed interest in me. This made me realise my potential and motivated me to continue athletics.   Tell us about your participation in a competition that is the most memorable and the achievements you have made to date.In the 2018 National Games, I represented APF and won a gold medal in the relay race. I consider it as my biggest achievement to date. In the recently held National Games in Pokhara, I came fourth in the 100-metre race but in the 200-metre race unfortunately I couldn’t compete due to the hamstring. And now for the first time, I am representing Nepal on the global platform, which is also one of my biggest achievements.  Professionally you are a financial analyst, so how have you been managing time for athletics?    Actually, it is not that difficult. Most of the athletics events take place in the morning and after completing them I go to the office. My passion for sports or athletics also helps me to keep doing so. If you have a  passion you can take both sports and work simultaneously.   As an athlete what sorts of challenges have you faced so far?The main challenge for Nepali athletes is the lack of exposure and sponsors.

The unattended issue of road safety in Nepal ,"Ashish Chaudhary scored his first goal for Nepal against Pakistan in the SAFF Championship on June 17, 2023. Photo: ANFABengaluru, June 28The game was on a knife-edge at the Sree Kanteerava Stadium in Bengaluru. Nepal were the better team but had nothing to show for it. Many had dubbed the game an exhibition and a dead rubber. But both Nepal and Pakistan wanted to end the SAFF Championship on a high.There was tension in the stadium. Both were pushing to score but the lack of quality on both sides was evident. It was clear if the game was to have a winner, it would come through a moment of brilliance or a mistake.Kiran Chemjong’s long clearance caused some chaos outside the Pakistan penalty area. The players were trying to clear the ball but it fell fortuitously on Ashish Chaudhary’s foot. Without thinking twice, Chaudhary hit the ball. It was not a convincing strike but the ball ended up in the back of the Pakistan net thanks to some uneven bounce as the boy who was working as a labourer in the southern plains of Nepal scored his first goal for the country and gave Nepal the lead.Prior to that, Nepal had many chances. Bimal Gharti Magar missed a sitter as Nepal hit the crossbar and the post a couple of times. It was like the universe did not want Nepal to score. But Chaudhary had a different idea as he gave Nepal their only win in the 2023 SAFF Championship.The moments following the goal were chaotic. Nepal had multiple chances to finish the game but lack of experience and quality meant the team could not take advantage of Pakistan going all in leaving gaps in defence.Ashish Chaudhary celebrates with teammates. Photo: ANFAThis was Nepal’s first win against Pakistan in the SAFF Championship in 15 years. But the win did not come easy. Pakistan’s lack of chemistry was evident as they should have been put away by Nepal long before Chaudhary scored in the 80th minute. This was Pakistan’s 12th loss in a row. Like Nepal, Pakistan had lost both its game in the SAFF Championship and were looking for a consolation win. But that was not to happen as the team once again performed below par and lost to an inexperienced NepalNepal, however, have only positives to take from the tournament.

6 popular music stores in Kathmandu  ,"Shakti Gauchan training young cricketers at Star Cricket Academy. Shakti Gauchan, known for his gentle demeanour and infectious smile, dedicated 19 years to serving Nepal’s national cricket team. Gauchan retired from international cricket five years ago but his life still revolves around it.His career has been a successful one. Along with Paras Khadka, Gauchan became a household name as he help take Nepal from the depths of Division 5 to gaining ODI status.He had many highs during his career. Playing in the 2014 T20 World Cup was his greatest moment but what stands out for him is how the team received ODI status for the first time in 2018. But one dream eluded him as Nepal never got close to becoming a test nation.“It is what it is,” says Gauchan.The test dreamShakti Gauchan played for Nepal’s national team for 19 years.But Shakti Gauchan has not given up on his dream. Gauchan, despite not playing a test, wants to pave the way for the coming generation as he hopes to see the country become a test nation in his lifetime.Every time he was not with the national team, he would be at the New Horizon School in Butwal training students. He worked there for 20 years.When being a cricketer was not as glorious as it is now, Gauchan was thankful to the school for employing him as a coach. The money he got from coaching kept his passion going and stopped him from giving up on cricket and leaving the country.“I would have surely left,” says Gauchan as cricketing events were sporadic at the time.Academy to produce cricket starsShakti Gauchan with the students of Star Cricket Academy. Shakti Gauchan wanted to establish a cricket academy when he was playing. He knew it was important as that would help the country produce good players. Recognising the importance of starting early, Gauchan, in 2019, founded the Star Cricket Academy on his personal property in Omsatiya rural municipality, Rupandehi. There, he trains kids as young as 10 as he hopes to produce cricketers for the national team for years to come.The academy features a dedicated training facility with nets, while the ground floor includes a hostel to accommodate players.The Star Cricket Academy provides training to a group of 50 schoolchildren aged 10 and above. Among them, 25 students receive free training at an academy. With his vast experience, Gauchan possesses the ability to identify potential talents among these aspiring young players.Asman Tharu, a 17-year-old from an economically disadvantaged background, is benefiting from free training at Star Cricket Academy.“Sir (Gauchan) does not take fees from me and even provides bat,” says Tharu. Having already participated in district-level competitions for his age category, Tharu is now dreaming to represent the national team in the future.Like Tharu, Rahul Bhandari has also been receiving training at Star Cricket Academy for the last four years. Bhandari says he has been inspired by players like Kushal Malla and Susan Bhari, who are products of Gauchan, as he wants to follow their steps and get into the national team.The construction of an indoor hall has provided a convenient training space for players, ensuring uninterrupted practice even during rainy seasons and winter. Malla’s remarkable progress is attributed to the availability of this facility, and Gauchan takes immense pride and happiness in witnessing his development.Spinner Sushan Bhari has emerged as a prominent player in domestic cricket, showcasing his talent and skills. Shakti Gauchan’s students have consistently displayed impressive performances, asserting their dominance in the age group team of Lumbini province. With their continuous progress, they are gradually carving out a significant place in the national team as well.Binod Kunwar and his wife Sudikshya Gautam, successful entrepreneurs running a technology company in Sydney, Australia, and Nepal, have shown their unwavering support to Gauchan.The two have taken a remarkable step by laying the foundation stone of Astrotech Oval, a cricket stadium in Tilottama. As part of their ambitious plan, they have entrusted Gauchan with the crucial responsibility of overseeing an academy that will accommodate 100 players with residential facilities.“This academy can significantly help me to attain my dream,” says Gauchan.  Gauchan expresses that the day when Nepal achieves test status in cricket will hold a significance even greater than his participation in the World Cup.This story was translated from the original Nepali version and edited for clarity and length.",['6 popular music store kathmandu'],"['shakti gauchan train young cricket star cricket academi .', 'shakti gauchan , known gentl demeanour infecti smile , dedic 19 year serv nepal ’ nation cricket team .', 'gauchan retir intern cricket five year ago life still revolv around it.hi career success one .', 'along para khadka , gauchan becam household name help take nepal depth divis 5 gain odi status.h mani high career .', 'play 2014 t20 world cup greatest moment stand team receiv odi statu first time 2018 .', 'one dream elud nepal never got close becom test nation . “ , ” say gauchan.th test dreamshakti gauchan play nepal ’ nation team 19 years.but shakti gauchan given dream .', 'gauchan , despit play test , want pave way come gener hope see countri becom test nation lifetime.everi time nation team , would new horizon school butwal train student .', 'work 20 years.when cricket gloriou , gauchan thank school employ coach .', 'money got coach kept passion go stop give cricket leav countri . “ would sure left , ” say gauchan cricket event sporad time.academi produc cricket starsshakti gauchan student star cricket academi .', 'shakti gauchan want establish cricket academi play .', 'knew import would help countri produc good player .', 'recognis import start earli , gauchan , 2019 , found star cricket academi person properti omsatiya rural municip , rupandehi .', ', train kid young 10 hope produc cricket nation team year come.th academi featur dedic train facil net , ground floor includ hostel accommod players.th star cricket academi provid train group 50 schoolchildren age 10 .', 'among , 25 student receiv free train academi .', 'vast experi , gauchan possess abil identifi potenti talent among aspir young players.asman tharu , 17-year-old econom disadvantag background , benefit free train star cricket academi . “ sir ( gauchan ) take fee even provid bat , ” say tharu .', 'alreadi particip district-level competit age categori , tharu dream repres nation team future.lik tharu , rahul bhandari also receiv train star cricket academi last four year .', 'bhandari say inspir player like kushal malla susan bhari , product gauchan , want follow step get nation team.th construct indoor hall provid conveni train space player , ensur uninterrupt practic even raini season winter .', 'malla ’ remark progress attribut avail facil , gauchan take immens pride happi wit development.spinn sushan bhari emerg promin player domest cricket , showcas talent skill .', 'shakti gauchan ’ student consist display impress perform , assert domin age group team lumbini provinc .', 'continu progress , gradual carv signific place nation team well.binod kunwar wife sudikshya gautam , success entrepreneur run technolog compani sydney , australia , nepal , shown unwav support gauchan.th two taken remark step lay foundat stone astrotech oval , cricket stadium tilottama .', 'part ambiti plan , entrust gauchan crucial respons overse academi accommod 100 player residenti facil . “ academi significantli help attain dream , ” say gauchan .', 'gauchan express day nepal achiev test statu cricket hold signific even greater particip world cup.thi stori translat origin nepali version edit clariti length .']"

Since 1993, Nepal has taken part in all SAFF Championships but has not won it a single time with their best finish coming in 2021 when it reached the final and lost to India.This year, the team once again failed as they bowed out of the group stage after losing to Kuwait and India. But the team has a chance to end the tournament on a positive note as they take on Pakistan later today.If the performance against Kuwait in the second half and India are to go by, Nepal has a great chance to finish the tournament with a consolation win in what many people are calling an exhibition match.Nepal started the SAFF Championship timidly and were punished by Kuwait who proved too good for Nepal. Nepal’s loss in the game can be attributed to a lacklustre start in the first half.

The preparation was poor and the team lacked experience. But, just like in life, football held the promise of hope, only to have it mercilessly crushed early on.“We have done well despite everything that has gone on in Nepali football over the last year,” said head coach Vincenzo Alberto Annese. “We had one practice match before the tournament. If you give me one month with this team, things would have been different.”Pakistan have not had the best tournament either. Making a comeback in SAFF Championship after their FIFA suspension, the team only arrived in India a few hours before their match against India. It was no surprise they were comfortably beaten by India and Kuwait. Prior to the tournament, Pakistan played in the four-nations cup in Mauritius where they were beaten by the hosts, Kenya and Djibouti. The team has players playing in European leagues, but the performance is not been up to the level and Pakistan want to change that against Nepal.In 2022, after their suspension was lifted, Pakistan took on Nepal in a friendly match and lost. So Pakistan will want to avenge that result. Nepal has also not beaten Pakistan in the SAFF Championship in over 15 years which a not a good omen for Nepal heading into the match today. The two have played each other seven times and have won two games each with three ending in draws. Overall, the two teams have played each other 17 times with Nepal winning six, Pakistan winning five and six ending in draws.Looking back at history and given how the two have performed, it is likely that this too will end in a stalemate.Both teams are likely to make changes. Anjan Bista is injured and will miss out said Annese as he has hinted he will make more changes and ask his team to play an attacking style and be more fearless.“We want to win and for that to happen, we need to be brave,” he said.",['realm 12 pro+ 5g : best design phone 2024 ?'],"['manish dangi tri retriev ball india june 23 , 2023 .', 'photo : anfabangalor , june 27the saff championship dream nepal ’ footbal team million footbal fan countri .', 'sinc 1993 , nepal taken part saff championship singl time best finish come 2021 reach final lost india.thi year , team fail bow group stage lose kuwait india .', 'team chanc end tournament posit note take pakistan later today.if perform kuwait second half india go , nepal great chanc finish tournament consol win mani peopl call exhibit match.nep start saff championship timidli punish kuwait prove good nepal .', 'nepal ’ loss game attribut lacklustr start first half .', 'team wake last 15 minut , game long lost then.sunil chhetri celebr rahim ali india beat nepal 2-0 saff championship june 24 , 2023 .', 'photo : anfaagainst india , thing differ .', 'team play solid game even chanc score .', 'take chanc , punish sunil chhetri lost 2-0 bow saff championship.everyon knew team readi take heavyweight like kuwait , india lebanon saff championship .', 'prepar poor team lack experi .', ', like life , footbal held promis hope , mercilessli crush earli on . “ done well despit everyth gone nepali footbal last year , ” said head coach vincenzo alberto annes .', '“ one practic match tournament .', 'give one month team , thing would differ . ” pakistan best tournament either .', 'make comeback saff championship fifa suspens , team arriv india hour match india .', 'surpris comfort beaten india kuwait .', 'prior tournament , pakistan play four-nat cup mauritiu beaten host , kenya djibouti .', 'team player play european leagu , perform level pakistan want chang nepal.in 2022 , suspens lift , pakistan took nepal friendli match lost .', 'pakistan want aveng result .', 'nepal also beaten pakistan saff championship 15 year good omen nepal head match today .', 'two play seven time two game three end draw .', 'overal , two team play 17 time nepal win six , pakistan win five six end draws.look back histori given two perform , like end stalemate.both team like make chang .', 'anjan bista injur miss said annes hint make chang ask team play attack style fearless . “ want win happen , need brave , ” said .']"

Nepal thrash Malaysia to win the ACC East Zone U16 Cup Cricket,"Sabitra Bhandari is regarded as one of the top strikers in South Asia, and she will be the first-ever Nepali footballer to play in Europe. Photo: Aryan DhimalAfter a decade of hustle, Sabitra Bhandari, also known as Samba, has finally accomplished her long-cherished aspiration of playing for a European team. On June 13,  the 26-year-old signed to play for an Israeli club Hapoel Raanana Women’s FC in the Israeli Women’s League ‘Ligat Nashim’. Bhandari is regarded as one of the top strikers in South Asia, and she will be the first-ever Nepali footballer to play in Europe. Her aspirations go beyond merely playing as Bhandari wants to make a lasting impact in the league. She views the Israeli league as a stepping stone towards her ultimate goal of representing top-tier European clubs.“I am excited to play in the league. I cannot express in words, how happy I am. But this is just the start,” she says.Humble beginningSabitra Bhandari’s footballing career started when she was signed up by the Armed Police Force (APF) in 2014 aged 18. Sabitra Bhandari developed a passion for football from a young age. Despite the modest circumstances, she would engage in the sport without owning proper footwear or a football. As the second child in a family of six siblings, she embraced her love for the game with limited resources.“I remember playing barefoot with balls made out of socks,” he says.As a woman whose main aim was to play football, Sabitra Bhandari faced numerous challenges along her journey. However, her unwavering dedication and relentless hard work propelled her forward. That was not all, Bhandari strongly believes that her parents played a pivotal role in shaping her current position.“They always inspired me to play football,” she says.She also thanks Sukra Tamang, a former ANFA referee, for introducing her to professional football.The dream beginsDuring the recently concluded Indian Women’s League in May, Sabitra Bhandari showcased outstanding performance and emerged as the top scorer in the league. Photo: Aryan DhimalSabitra Bhandari’s footballing career started when she was signed up by the Armed Police Force (APF) in 2014 aged 18. Her performance at the club level soon got her a national team call up and since then Bhandari has not looked back.She has been amazing scoring 43 goals in 41 games. Her performance in these games has been nothing short of extraordinary. But has faced some setbacks most notably tearing her anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) in 2021 while playing in the Women’s National League.“I could not play for a year. That made me very anxious as I spend days thinking if I could come back to football. But everything went well and here I am going to Israel,” she says.During the recently concluded Indian Women’s League in May, Sabitra Bhandari showcased outstanding performance and emerged as the top scorer in the league. She feels playing in India has been integral to her getting signed up by an Israeli team as her dream to play in Europe is finally being fulfilled.The opportunity and future prospectSabitra Bhandari is not wasting time and has already started to train to play in the Israeli league. Photo: Aryan Dhimal Sabitra Bhandrai’s performance in India had everyone in Nepal raving. Watching her showcase her talent there was the head coach of the men’s football team Vincenzo Alberto Annese. Annese played a pivotal role in connecting Bhandari with an agent who has now provided her with an exciting opportunity to exhibit her talent in Israel.“One day he called me and informed me that he has a friend who is an agent. He told me she could help me fulfil my dream of playing in a European league. I did not think twice and spoke to her,” says Bhandari.Following their talk, the agent found Bhandari a club. But she views this accomplishment as the beginning of her journey as she is dreaming big.“I want to play for the top clubs in the world. I will continue to work hard to fulfil that dream,” she says. Sabitra Bhandari is not wasting time and has already started to train to play in the Israeli league. Committed as ever, she is following the practice schedule of Hapoel Raanana Women’s FC, immersing herself in the training regimen of the team so she can adapt quickly and make a mark in the league.Hapoel Raanana was not the only team that approached her. She was approached by the league champions too, but she felt the project offered by Hapoel Raanana was best for her career.The joy of Bhandari’s achievement extends beyond her personal fulfilment. Her teammates are equally happy for her are are celebrating her success.“The younger players have been thanking me for opening an avenue to a European league,” says Bhandari. “The senior players are also equally positive, they have been motivating me for further growth.”  Another exciting development for Nepali football enthusiasts is that Nepal will be participating in the Asian Games for the very first time. This milestone presents a remarkable opportunity Sabitra Bhandri and the women’s team to test themselves against the best in Asia.“I am excited for the Asian Games. We all area. It will give us good exposure. If we perform well, there will be more opporutinies for us,” she says.Despite the Nepali women’s football team progressing remarkably, the concerned bodies have remained indifferent to its development. Nepal’s football governing body, the All Nepal Football Association (ANFA) does not organise regular tournaments which means new players hardly get chances to join the national team. Apart from three departmental teams, Nepal does not have permanent women’s football clubs. This absence of dedicated clubs poses challenges in organising domestic leagues for women’s football in the country. Sabitra Bhandari believes, addressing this gap and establishing more women’s football clubs could contribute to the growth of women’s football in Nepal.“We have many good players who are waiting for a chance. If A Division clubs support us, we can take the women’s football team to new heights,” she says.",['nepal thrash malaysia win acc east zone u16 cup cricket'],"['sabitra bhandari regard one top striker south asia , first-ev nepali footbal play europ .', 'photo : aryan dhimalaft decad hustl , sabitra bhandari , also known samba , final accomplish long-cherish aspir play european team .', 'june 13 , 26-year-old sign play isra club hapoel raanana women ’ fc isra women ’ leagu ‘ ligat nashim ’ .', 'bhandari regard one top striker south asia , first-ev nepali footbal play europ .', 'aspir go beyond mere play bhandari want make last impact leagu .', 'view isra leagu step stone toward ultim goal repres top-tier european club . “ excit play leagu .', 'express word , happi .', 'start , ” says.humbl beginningsabitra bhandari ’ footbal career start sign arm polic forc ( apf ) 2014 age 18 .', 'sabitra bhandari develop passion footbal young age .', 'despit modest circumst , would engag sport without own proper footwear footbal .', 'second child famili six sibl , embrac love game limit resourc . “ rememb play barefoot ball made sock , ” says.a woman whose main aim play footbal , sabitra bhandari face numer challeng along journey .', 'howev , unwav dedic relentless hard work propel forward .', ', bhandari strongli believ parent play pivot role shape current posit . “ alway inspir play footbal , ” says.sh also thank sukra tamang , former anfa refere , introduc profession football.th dream beginsdur recent conclud indian women ’ leagu may , sabitra bhandari showcas outstand perform emerg top scorer leagu .', 'photo : aryan dhimalsabitra bhandari ’ footbal career start sign arm polic forc ( apf ) 2014 age 18 .', 'perform club level soon got nation team call sinc bhandari look back.sh amaz score 43 goal 41 game .', 'perform game noth short extraordinari .', 'face setback notabl tear anterior cruciat ligament ( acl ) 2021 play women ’ nation leagu . “ could play year .', 'made anxiou spend day think could come back footbal .', 'everyth went well go israel , ” says.dur recent conclud indian women ’ leagu may , sabitra bhandari showcas outstand perform emerg top scorer leagu .', 'feel play india integr get sign isra team dream play europ final fulfilled.th opportun futur prospectsabitra bhandari wast time alreadi start train play isra leagu .', 'photo : aryan dhimal sabitra bhandrai ’ perform india everyon nepal rave .', 'watch showcas talent head coach men ’ footbal team vincenzo alberto annes .', 'annes play pivot role connect bhandari agent provid excit opportun exhibit talent israel . “ one day call inform friend agent .', 'told could help fulfil dream play european leagu .', 'think twice spoke , ” say bhandari.follow talk , agent found bhandari club .', 'view accomplish begin journey dream big . “ want play top club world .', 'continu work hard fulfil dream , ” say .', 'sabitra bhandari wast time alreadi start train play isra leagu .', 'commit ever , follow practic schedul hapoel raanana women ’ fc , immers train regimen team adapt quickli make mark league.hapoel raanana team approach .', 'approach leagu champion , felt project offer hapoel raanana best career.th joy bhandari ’ achiev extend beyond person fulfil .', 'teammat equal happi celebr success . “ younger player thank open avenu european leagu , ” say bhandari .', '“ senior player also equal posit , motiv growth . ” anoth excit develop nepali footbal enthusiast nepal particip asian game first time .', 'mileston present remark opportun sabitra bhandri women ’ team test best asia . “ excit asian game .', 'area .', 'give us good exposur .', 'perform well , opporutini us , ” says.despit nepali women ’ footbal team progress remark , concern bodi remain indiffer develop .', 'nepal ’ footbal govern bodi , nepal footbal associ ( anfa ) organis regular tournament mean new player hardli get chanc join nation team .', 'apart three department team , nepal perman women ’ footbal club .', 'absenc dedic club pose challeng organis domest leagu women ’ footbal countri .', 'sabitra bhandari believ , address gap establish women ’ footbal club could contribut growth women ’ footbal nepal . “ mani good player wait chanc .', 'divis club support us , take women ’ footbal team new height , ” say .']"

"ICC World Cup Qualifier: Nepal beat UAE, will play Ireland for seventh place","Head coach Vincenzo Alberto Annese putting players through their paces. Photo: ANFABengaluru, June 21Today, Nepal is set to face Kuwait in their opening match of the SAFF Championship at the Sree Kanteerava Stadium in Bengaluru.The Nepali team has arrived in Bengaluru with very little preparation with their new coach and a very inexperienced team.Despite that, head coach Vincenzo Alberto Annese up hopeful to bring a good result against tournament favourites Kuwait.Speaking to Onlinekhabar on Tuesday, Annese said despite not having enough time to prepare for the tournament, the team was in good spirits ahead of their first game against Kuwait.“We are fit and ready. Kuwait are a good team and we know it is going to be tough but we are ready for the challenge,” he said.He feels the preparations would have been better if they had more time before the tournament. But with the league ending only 10 days ahead of the tournament, Annese could not prepare the team as he would have liked.“The game against the Philippines was good practice for us. We took on them with only two days of training and did quite well. We had chances in the game. If we had 10 days before that game, we could have won I feel,” he says.It has been a little over three months since Annese took over as the head coach. As the league season was ongoing at that time, he has not been able to spend much time with the national team. Despite that, he feels hopeful.Annese did not say what his goals were for the SAFF Championship. But he did say he wants to start the tournament positively and hopes the team can play with his philosophy.“My and the team’s main focus right now is Kuwait. We go one game at a time,” he said.Familiar foesNepal and Kuwait have been meeting regularly. Since 2019, the two have played five times with Kuwait winning four and drawing one.In the nine total games the two have played against each other, Kuwait have won eight of them with their latest win coming in June 2022 during the AFC Asian Cup Qualifier where they beat Nepal 4-1.This, however, is Kuwait’s first participation in the SAFF Championship and Nepal wants to welcome the Kuwaitis with a defeat in their first match.","['icc world cup qualifi : nepal beat uae , play ireland seventh place']","['head coach vincenzo alberto annes put player pace .', 'photo : anfabengaluru , june 21today , nepal set face kuwait open match saff championship sree kanteerava stadium bengaluru.th nepali team arriv bengaluru littl prepar new coach inexperienc team.despit , head coach vincenzo alberto annes hope bring good result tournament favourit kuwait.speak onlinekhabar tuesday , annes said despit enough time prepar tournament , team good spirit ahead first game kuwait . “ fit readi .', 'kuwait good team know go tough readi challeng , ” said.h feel prepar would better time tournament .', 'leagu end 10 day ahead tournament , annes could prepar team would like . “ game philippin good practic us .', 'took two day train quit well .', 'chanc game .', '10 day game , could feel , ” says.it littl three month sinc annes took head coach .', 'leagu season ongo time , abl spend much time nation team .', 'despit , feel hopeful.annes say goal saff championship .', 'say want start tournament posit hope team play philosophi . “ team ’ main focu right kuwait .', 'go one game time , ” said.familiar foesnep kuwait meet regularli .', 'sinc 2019 , two play five time kuwait win four draw one.in nine total game two play , kuwait eight latest win come june 2022 afc asian cup qualifi beat nepal 4-1.thi , howev , kuwait ’ first particip saff championship nepal want welcom kuwaiti defeat first match .']"

But with wickets falling at the other end regularly, Jahangir was left frustrated as the US were bowled out for 207 in 49 overs.Karan KC was the pick of the bowlers as he took four wickets for 33 runs. Airee and Lalit Rajbanshi were also impressive as they held off an end. Airee took two wickets in five overs giving away only 15 runs while Rajbanshi took one wicket in 10 overs giving away only 20 runs. Jha finished the US’s tail as he took three wickets.In reply, Nepali openers started where they left off in the first game against Zimbabwe as they attacked the US bowlers. But their attacking gameplay did not pay dividends and Saurabh Netravalkar trapped Aasif Sheikh and Nosthush Kenjige caught Kushal Bhurtel for 12 and 39 respectively.But a mature innings from Bhim Sarki (77) and a late burst from Airee (39) took Nepal home giving the rhinos the first win of the ICC World Cup Qualifier. Kenjige and Jessy Singh did trouble the Nepali batters but did not get the rewards thanks to some poor fielding from the team.Nepal will play the West Indies on June 22.",['vincenzo alberto annes name 30-man preliminari squad 2026 world cup qualifi'],"['nepali player celebr karan kc second match icc cricket world cup qualifi usa takashinga sport club harar june 20 .', 'photo : icckathmandu , june 20nepal beat usa six wicket second game icc cricket world cup qualifi takashinga sport club harar june 20.win toss , nepal put usa bat immedi reap reward karan kc sent back steven taylor saiteja mukkamalla second game .', 'us batter struggl kc ’ precis line length leav visibl uncomfort throughout open hour match.kc ’ disciplin prove good , us ’ stand-in captain , aaron jone nosthush kenjig soon fell victim reduc us 18 loss four wickets.gajanand singh , centurion us west indi , tri take game nepali bowler along sushant modani 47-run stand broken dipendra singh airee.shayan jahangir usa play shot icc cricket world cup qualifi match nepal usa takashinga sport club june 20 .', 'photo : iccshayan jahangir play posit stroke settl inning us .', 'took nepali bowler includ sandeep lamichhan gulshan jha aarif sheikh score impress 79-ball centuri .', 'wicket fall end regularli , jahangir left frustrat us bowl 207 49 overs.karan kc pick bowler took four wicket 33 run .', 'aire lalit rajbanshi also impress held end .', 'aire took two wicket five over give away 15 run rajbanshi took one wicket 10 over give away 20 run .', 'jha finish us ’ tail took three wickets.in repli , nepali open start left first game zimbabw attack us bowler .', 'attack gameplay pay dividend saurabh netravalkar trap aasif sheikh nosthush kenjig caught kushal bhurtel 12 39 respectively.but matur inning bhim sarki ( 77 ) late burst aire ( 39 ) took nepal home give rhino first win icc world cup qualifi .', 'kenjig jessi singh troubl nepali batter get reward thank poor field team.nep play west indi june 22 .']"
Nepal reach the semi-final of ACC East Zone U16 Cup Cricket,"As untouched and less discussed as the sports management industry is in Nepal, it has ample room to showcase creativity. Photo by Miguel Bruna on UnsplashIn 2023, Barbie named Women in Sports as their career of the year.Whenever I am out and about socially, there is always someone who seems pretty certain about not considering my profession as mainstream. Hold up! Sports as a career? In Nepal? You bet! This article aims to explain why women in this male-dominant sports industry in Nepal should not be viewed as a surprise.I have been part of the Nepali cricket industry in a private capacity for quite a while now. Armed with a Master’s Degree in IT from an American University, my choice to stick with sports management tends to raise eyebrows. While I am not an on-field player, I am definitely behind the scenes, playing strong games of serious deliverance with my team. We are all about creating what is not there.As untouched and less discussed as the sports management industry is in Nepal, it has ample room to showcase creativity. Being a commanding woman in a position can be challenging, but on the brighter side, the gender advantage has yet to fail me. As alien as I might be in sports management in Nepal, I have been accepted with open arms. The nature of the job is highly competitive, no doubt.Embraced by the sports fraternityPhoto: PixabayWomen in sports are safe, heard, and welcomed. I absolutely relish the addition of spirited women to the team. The nuances of sports are something women complement greatly. Sports management inherently rejects narrow minds. There is a lot of travelling, meeting people, experimenting, and remembering limitations. The adjustments are both trivial and clever. Often, in our part of the world, societal norms limit women from making career decisions, hindering them from living life on their terms. This restriction potentially keeps many capable women from pursuing the sports industry, where they could truly wield their power to make an impact. Change is gradual, and I hope to see numerous female faces in charge of stadiums someday in Nepal.Yes, there are challenges. It ranges from personal sacrifices to job security and opportunities. However, these are workable factors for any freelancer in sports management. The key is excelling at our jobs to thrive anywhere. Taking a page from the medical field, the seriousness we apply there should not differ in sports management. Sports is a powerful industry. Children grow up idolising what we showcase on TV. As glorious as the game is, it is every child’s dream to represent their country someday. Carrying that responsibility is our role in sports—an often thankless yet deeply satisfying job.Nepali sports industryThe fans went wild at TU Cricket Ground after Nepal beat UAE.Sports may be a smaller industry in Nepal, but globally, it is a behemoth. The world economy has shifted, and it is time we alter our perspective to recognise the potential of sports as an industry in Nepal. The idea of open commercialisation of sports remains somewhat unexplored, as it continues to be a more exclusive affair in Nepal. By sourcing innovative ideas, there’s a wealth of public attention and investment waiting to be tapped into, along with numerous practices to establish and discard. As the Nepali team achieves international records, the packaging of the sport becomes everything. There is plenty to learn from international sports management to make our industry highly marketable and poised for global entry.Sports such as cricket, football, volleyball, or even golf serve as key intersections for reshaping Nepal’s global narrative. Over the years, Kabaddi has witnessed a substantial surge in India, both in terms of viewership and commercial success. The primary challenge we grapple with is Nepal’s comparatively small market size, posing constraints on our ability to generate substantial economic gains. Therefore, there is unanimous agreement on the imperative for Nepal’s sports to venture onto the international stage.Nepal boasts many hardworking individuals, yet achieving this goal demands specialised talents in sports management with the requisite experience and the capacity to enhance existing values. In the long run, outsourcing such talents may foster dependence. Hence, a concerted effort is needed to inspire Nepali youth to engage in sports management, contributing to our sports ecosystem. There are various ways in which we can harness the potential of sports for our benefit. Encouraging youth involvement can be instrumental in capitalising on the multifaceted opportunities presented by the sports industry. There is a lot to explore if you think about it.",['nepal reach semi-fin acc east zone u16 cup cricket'],"['untouch less discuss sport manag industri nepal , ampl room showcas creativ .', 'photo miguel bruna unsplashin 2023 , barbi name women sport career year.whenev social , alway someon seem pretti certain consid profess mainstream .', 'hold !', 'sport career ?', 'nepal ?', 'bet !', 'articl aim explain women male-domin sport industri nepal view surprise.i part nepali cricket industri privat capac quit .', 'arm master ’ degre american univers , choic stick sport manag tend rais eyebrow .', 'on-field player , definit behind scene , play strong game seriou deliver team .', 'creat there.a untouch less discuss sport manag industri nepal , ampl room showcas creativ .', 'command woman posit challeng , brighter side , gender advantag yet fail .', 'alien might sport manag nepal , accept open arm .', 'natur job highli competit , doubt.embrac sport fraternityphoto : pixabaywomen sport safe , heard , welcom .', 'absolut relish addit spirit women team .', 'nuanc sport someth women complement greatli .', 'sport manag inher reject narrow mind .', 'lot travel , meet peopl , experi , rememb limit .', 'adjust trivial clever .', 'often , part world , societ norm limit women make career decis , hinder live life term .', 'restrict potenti keep mani capabl women pursu sport industri , could truli wield power make impact .', 'chang gradual , hope see numer femal face charg stadium someday nepal.y , challeng .', 'rang person sacrific job secur opportun .', 'howev , workabl factor freelanc sport manag .', 'key excel job thrive anywher .', 'take page medic field , serious appli differ sport manag .', 'sport power industri .', 'children grow idolis showcas tv .', 'gloriou game , everi child ’ dream repres countri someday .', 'carri respons role sports—an often thankless yet deepli satisfi job.nepali sport industryth fan went wild tu cricket ground nepal beat uae.sport may smaller industri nepal , global , behemoth .', 'world economi shift , time alter perspect recognis potenti sport industri nepal .', 'idea open commercialis sport remain somewhat unexplor , continu exclus affair nepal .', 'sourc innov idea , ’ wealth public attent invest wait tap , along numer practic establish discard .', 'nepali team achiev intern record , packag sport becom everyth .', 'plenti learn intern sport manag make industri highli market pois global entry.sport cricket , footbal , volleybal , even golf serv key intersect reshap nepal ’ global narr .', 'year , kabaddi wit substanti surg india , term viewership commerci success .', 'primari challeng grappl nepal ’ compar small market size , pose constraint abil gener substanti econom gain .', 'therefor , unanim agreement imper nepal ’ sport ventur onto intern stage.nep boast mani hardwork individu , yet achiev goal demand specialis talent sport manag requisit experi capac enhanc exist valu .', 'long run , outsourc talent may foster depend .', 'henc , concert effort need inspir nepali youth engag sport manag , contribut sport ecosystem .', 'variou way har potenti sport benefit .', 'encourag youth involv instrument capitalis multifacet opportun present sport industri .', 'lot explor think .']"
Nepal to take on UAE in the seventh-place playoff of the ICC Cricket World Cup Qualifier,"Painting ‘My Private Life’ by artist Priyam Pradhan at the exhibition Mani at Siddhartha Art Gallery, Baber Mahal. Photo: Chandra Bahadur AleUsing Pitt’s artist pen on paper, artist Priyam Pradhan presents My Private Life, a showcase of the current significance of his life depicted in abstract form.At the centre of the painting is a 1000-rupee note, within which Pradhan has intricately painted Lord Krishna, a man wearing a hoodie tenderly embracing his dog, and a woman. The woman stands tall, elongated in form. Towards the bottom of the canvas, a holy man reaches out his hands, appearing to be in flight.Priyam Pradhan has used a vibrant colour palette, incorporating bright hues such as pink, orange, and yellow, as well as green, black, white, and grey. This combination adds a dynamic and lively quality to the artwork.“The man in the centre is me and the girl in green is my girlfriend. And the faces are my mom and dad,” says Pradhan. “The sadhu (holy man) symbolises my desires that I don’t have many desires for materialistic things however I do understand the value of money.”The use of colours, figures and lines in an abstract form in his painting resembles the painting of American painter Paul Jackson Pollock. Like his abstract expressionism, Pradhan has expressed himself in his painting.Furthermore, this marks Priyam Pradhan’s third solo painting exhibition titled Mani (money), inaugurated on January 17 at Siddhartha Art Gallery, Baber Mahal.In his previous exhibitions, Pradhan’s artworks centred around Hindu philosophy and his spontaneous thought process. However, in this latest exhibition, he explores the theme of money and its impact on an individual’s life, delving into the reverberating effects of financial aspects.Understanding the value of moneyPaintings by artist Priyam Pradhan at Siddhartha Art Gallery, Baber Mahal. Photo: Chandra Bahadur AleAny form of art is known as a reflection of the contemporary time. Likewise, Priyam Pradhan’s paintings reflect the lifestyle, desires, obligations and more of today’s younger generation living in urban areas in Nepal.Pradhan himself is in his 20s and he has justified the want of most of the youngsters in their 20s, who might be declared adults and understand the need for money and materialistic things but are still kids at their heart who want to explore and experience life as much as possible.The exhibition has 27 paintings which Pradhan took around nine months to complete. According to him, while he was travelling the idea that his life was luxurious and him being capable of exploring anything he wanted to was because of money.And being an artist this concept lingered on him and he was compelled to create on the theme of money.Once you enter the gallery, you can also view an animated video, which introduces artist Pradhan and the importance of money, which is on the ground floor. On the first floor, a huge painting (193×62 in cm) Apatkalin Awastha using mixed media on canvas welcomes you and other paintings are small in size (18×30 in cm).“It is a team work and it is my introduction as an artist for the exhibition,” he says. “Also, being a recent multimedia graduate from Islington College, I wanted to explore my skills and I got my team. Then, like money, multimedia is relevant to current society.”Experiencing life through artPainting by artist Priyam Pradhan at Siddhartha Art Gallery, Baber Mahal. Photo: Chandra Bahadur Ale Priyam Pradhan says enjoyment is the meaning of life and he enjoys creating artwork. Moreover, Pradhan who came into the art world first being a tattoo artist feels blessed that he has the privilege to explore whatever he likes in his life.He also believes that the philosophy that says one should not be materialistic is wrong. “If material things are not important, why would one build a house? And after building a house why do they want to decorate their house?” he questions.Alongside, money and materialistic things, his paintings also explore love, romance, life and childhood experiences. Motifs like Pokemon, ramen noodles, animals, dancers, etc have been used in his paintings. In most of his paintings, he has used numerous white lines in wavy form and these lines for Pradhan indicate the sound or the energy that exists in the surroundings all the time.About using a pitta artist pen, he says, “I have enjoyed drawing and painting since my childhood and using a pitta artist pen helps me revisit that feeling of happiness and sense of freedom.”So many things happening on the canvas with the use of vibrant colours gives a sense of excitement to the viewers. Though referencing artists like Pollock, MF Husain, Picasso and more, his pen strokes give a sense of newness through his expression and thoughts about his life experiences.In his paintings, these bright colours and motifs are in harmony and are visual treats that can surely cheer up the mood of any visitor. Moreover, you can also get free stickers from the artist.If you too are in a gloomy mood and want to uplift a little, visit the exhibition that continues till February 6.",['nepal take uae seventh-plac playoff icc cricket world cup qualifi'],"['paint ‘ privat life ’ artist priyam pradhan exhibit mani siddhartha art galleri , baber mahal .', 'photo : chandra bahadur aleus pitt ’ artist pen paper , artist priyam pradhan present privat life , showcas current signific life depict abstract form.at centr paint 1000-rupe note , within pradhan intric paint lord krishna , man wear hoodi tenderli embrac dog , woman .', 'woman stand tall , elong form .', 'toward bottom canva , holi man reach hand , appear flight.priyam pradhan use vibrant colour palett , incorpor bright hue pink , orang , yellow , well green , black , white , grey .', 'combin add dynam live qualiti artwork . “ man centr girl green girlfriend .', 'face mom dad , ” say pradhan .', '“ sadhu ( holi man ) symbolis desir ’ mani desir materialist thing howev understand valu money . ” use colour , figur line abstract form paint resembl paint american painter paul jackson pollock .', 'like abstract expression , pradhan express painting.furthermor , mark priyam pradhan ’ third solo paint exhibit titl mani ( money ) , inaugur januari 17 siddhartha art galleri , baber mahal.in previou exhibit , pradhan ’ artwork centr around hindu philosophi spontan thought process .', 'howev , latest exhibit , explor theme money impact individu ’ life , delv reverber effect financi aspects.understand valu moneypaint artist priyam pradhan siddhartha art galleri , baber mahal .', 'photo : chandra bahadur aleani form art known reflect contemporari time .', 'likewis , priyam pradhan ’ paint reflect lifestyl , desir , oblig today ’ younger gener live urban area nepal.pradhan 20 justifi want youngster 20 , might declar adult understand need money materialist thing still kid heart want explor experi life much possible.th exhibit 27 paint pradhan took around nine month complet .', 'accord , travel idea life luxuri capabl explor anyth want money.and artist concept linger compel creat theme money.onc enter galleri , also view anim video , introduc artist pradhan import money , ground floor .', 'first floor , huge paint ( 193×62 cm ) apatkalin awastha use mix media canva welcom paint small size ( 18×30 cm ) . “ team work introduct artist exhibit , ” say .', '“ also , recent multimedia graduat islington colleg , want explor skill got team .', ', like money , multimedia relev current societi . ” experienc life artpaint artist priyam pradhan siddhartha art galleri , baber mahal .', 'photo : chandra bahadur ale priyam pradhan say enjoy mean life enjoy creat artwork .', 'moreov , pradhan came art world first tattoo artist feel bless privileg explor whatev like life.h also believ philosophi say one materialist wrong .', '“ materi thing import , would one build hous ?', 'build hous want decor hous ? ” questions.alongsid , money materialist thing , paint also explor love , romanc , life childhood experi .', 'motif like pokemon , ramen noodl , anim , dancer , etc use paint .', 'paint , use numer white line wavi form line pradhan indic sound energi exist surround time.about use pitta artist pen , say , “ enjoy draw paint sinc childhood use pitta artist pen help revisit feel happi sens freedom . ” mani thing happen canva use vibrant colour give sens excit viewer .', 'though referenc artist like pollock , mf husain , picasso , pen stroke give sens new express thought life experiences.in paint , bright colour motif harmoni visual treat sure cheer mood visitor .', 'moreov , also get free sticker artist.if gloomi mood want uplift littl , visit exhibit continu till februari 6 .']"
Nepal end the SAFF Championship on a high as they beat Pakistan 1-0,"Entrepreneurship education is not just an investment in the education system; it is an investment in the nation’s future prosperity. Photo: Pexels/ Rodnae ProductionsIn the shadow of the towering Himalayas, Nepal faces a challenge that rivals the steepness of its mountainous terrain- the challenge of economic development. As the nation earnestly pursues its Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), it becomes increasingly evident that a transformation in the education system is not only necessary but also urgent. Rooted in common living strategies, the prevailing education model, especially in higher education, may not adequately prepare the youth for the demands of the modern world. In this critical juncture, the incorporation of entrepreneurship education emerges as a beacon of hope, offering a pathway towards a self-reliant and prosperous Nepal.Time to reevaluate the education systemNepal’s journey towards economic prosperity has been marked by challenges that demand innovative solutions. The commitment of the SDGs reflects not only a global responsibility but also a domestic imperative for sustainable development. For this, it is high time to reevaluate the education system in the country.The current education system in Nepal, deeply entrenched in common living strategies, has been the foundation of learning for generations. However, in the face of a rapidly evolving world, today’s generation aspires for more than the status quo. The call for independence reverberates through the aspirations of youth who seek a curriculum fostering critical thinking, innovation and entrepreneurial skills.Entrepreneurship education is a dynamic force capable of reshaping Nepal’s educational landscape. This innovative approach moves beyond traditional learning methods, providing students with the tools to navigate the complexities of the modern world. At its core, entrepreneurship education is about empowering students to implement learned information in practical and tangible ways.Consider a student engrossed in the intricacies of sensor systems during a science class, entrepreneurship education transforms this theoretical knowledge into practical applications, inspiring the creation of a sensor-operated door. Such innovation born from a fusion of science and entrepreneurship becomes a valuable mindset in solving practical problems.  Expanding the horizons of entrepreneurship education, let us delve into chemistry. Imagine students studying chemistry not just as a theoretical subject, but also as entrepreneurs in the making. Armed with entrepreneurial principles, these students can tap into Nepal’s rich biodiversity, exploring market demands for products derived from local plants.In the scenario, chemistry students could embark on a journey to develop performance-enhancing products based on market demand, harnessing the potential of indigenous flora. What makes this approach remarkable is that it does not necessarily require sophisticated machines or extensive human resources. Instead, it leverages the inherent skills and awareness of individuals within the community, paving the way for a grassroots economic revolution.Entrepreneurship in education Representational graphic. Image: FreepikThe beauty of entrepreneurship education lies in its universal applicability. It is not confined to science or chemistry alone. Consider an art student, for example. Through entrepreneurship education, they can understand what art to develop (product), how much to set the price (price), where to sell (place) and how to sell (promote) their artworks. Every subject becomes a canvas for innovation and enterprise.Moreover, entrepreneurship education is a powerful equaliser, recognising the unique skills and talents of individuals across various disciplines. It is not about fitting into a predefined mould but rather about unleashing the potential within each student. When every single person is aware of their skills and potential, they can rise to different levels, contributing to the overall progress of the nation.Entrepreneurship education goes beyond skill recognition; it is about nurturing the ability to produce goods and mastering the art of marketing. Returning to the example of the student developing a sensor-operated door, entrepreneurship education not only equips them to produce the product but also teaches them how to navigate the complexities of marketing it to potential users and clients.The impact of entrepreneurship education extends beyond individual success stories; it reverberates through the entire nation. A generation equipped with entrepreneurial skills becomes a driving force for economic growth and independence. They will be able to recognise the resources and ideas to utilise them to reach the global market. They will be able to be the pioneers in products and contribute to the economy. By fostering a culture of innovation, creativity and self-reliance, Nepal can reduce its dependence on external sources and strengthen its economy from within.In essence, entrepreneurship education is not just an investment in the education system; it is an investment in the nation’s future prosperity. It is a transformative force that has the potential to shape a generation of independent thinkers, innovators and entrepreneurs- the architects of a self-reliant and economically vibrant Nepal. Entrepreneurship education, by teaching students to utilise available resources (physical and financial) and make them commercial, becomes a cornerstone in the nation’s journey towards economic empowerment and independence.",['nepal end saff championship high beat pakistan 1-0'],"['entrepreneurship educ invest educ system ; invest nation ’ futur prosper .', 'photo : pexels/ rodna productionsin shadow tower himalaya , nepal face challeng rival steep mountain terrain- challeng econom develop .', 'nation earnestli pursu sustain develop goal ( sdg ) , becom increasingli evid transform educ system necessari also urgent .', 'root common live strategi , prevail educ model , especi higher educ , may adequ prepar youth demand modern world .', 'critic junctur , incorpor entrepreneurship educ emerg beacon hope , offer pathway toward self-reli prosper nepal.tim reevalu educ systemnep ’ journey toward econom prosper mark challeng demand innov solut .', 'commit sdg reflect global respons also domest imper sustain develop .', ', high time reevalu educ system country.th current educ system nepal , deepli entrench common live strategi , foundat learn gener .', 'howev , face rapidli evolv world , today ’ gener aspir statu quo .', 'call independ reverber aspir youth seek curriculum foster critic think , innov entrepreneuri skills.entrepreneurship educ dynam forc capabl reshap nepal ’ educ landscap .', 'innov approach move beyond tradit learn method , provid student tool navig complex modern world .', 'core , entrepreneurship educ empow student implement learn inform practic tangibl ways.consid student engross intricaci sensor system scienc class , entrepreneurship educ transform theoret knowledg practic applic , inspir creation sensor-oper door .', 'innov born fusion scienc entrepreneurship becom valuabl mindset solv practic problem .', 'expand horizon entrepreneurship educ , let us delv chemistri .', 'imagin student studi chemistri theoret subject , also entrepreneur make .', 'arm entrepreneuri principl , student tap nepal ’ rich biodivers , explor market demand product deriv local plants.in scenario , chemistri student could embark journey develop performance-enhanc product base market demand , har potenti indigen flora .', 'make approach remark necessarili requir sophist machin extens human resourc .', 'instead , leverag inher skill awar individu within commun , pave way grassroot econom revolution.entrepreneurship educ represent graphic .', 'imag : freepikth beauti entrepreneurship educ lie univers applic .', 'confin scienc chemistri alon .', 'consid art student , exampl .', 'entrepreneurship educ , understand art develop ( product ) , much set price ( price ) , sell ( place ) sell ( promot ) artwork .', 'everi subject becom canva innov enterprise.moreov , entrepreneurship educ power equalis , recognis uniqu skill talent individu across variou disciplin .', 'fit predefin mould rather unleash potenti within student .', 'everi singl person awar skill potenti , rise differ level , contribut overal progress nation.entrepreneurship educ goe beyond skill recognit ; nurtur abil produc good master art market .', 'return exampl student develop sensor-oper door , entrepreneurship educ equip produc product also teach navig complex market potenti user clients.th impact entrepreneurship educ extend beyond individu success stori ; reverber entir nation .', 'gener equip entrepreneuri skill becom drive forc econom growth independ .', 'abl recognis resourc idea utilis reach global market .', 'abl pioneer product contribut economi .', 'foster cultur innov , creativ self-reli , nepal reduc depend extern sourc strengthen economi within.in essenc , entrepreneurship educ invest educ system ; invest nation ’ futur prosper .', 'transform forc potenti shape gener independ thinker , innov entrepreneurs- architect self-reli econom vibrant nepal .', 'entrepreneurship educ , teach student utilis avail resourc ( physic financi ) make commerci , becom cornerston nation ’ journey toward econom empower independ .']"

CAVA Men’s Volleyball: Nepal finish the tournament winless,"Ram Bujhaun Yadav with his land ownership certificate stands near a border pillar which he says was erroneously placed on his land. In October 2023, when 51-year-old Ram Bujhaun Yadav of Musaharnia Rural Municipality-5, Mukhiyapatti, Dhanusha, was at a relative’s house, someone told him that two Indian Sashastra Seema Bal (SSB) personnel were looking for him.Anxious, he rushed home wondering why they were looking for him.“They asked me if the paddy field in the no man’s land was mine. I told them yes and they asked me to cut down the paddy immediately,” he said.The paddy was not ripe and Yadav asked them for some time. However, the SSB personnel told him he had to cut down his paddy immediately.Ram Bujhaun and his wife Tetari Devi each own a 677-square-metre plot of land. As Nepal and India reevaluated the border, Ram Bujhan’s land was been deemed to be near the no man’s land as it now has two demarcation pillars.Frustrated, Ram Bujhaun cut the paddy before it was due to be harvested. Now, he has been asked to not plant anything on the land as it falls in the no man’s land.“Our border police don’t say a word. I can’t fight the SSB on my own,” says Ram Bujhaun adding he had decided not to plan anything on the land anymore.Woes of the farmersMany farmers in southern Nepal say their land has now been placed in India after the recent demarcation. When the Jamuna River, which flows through the no man’s land between Nepal and India, changed its course some two decades ago, some border pillars went missing. Locals say these pillars have now been placed encroaching on Nepali land.In 2018, with the then Chief District Officer of Dhanusha, Pradeep Raj Kandel, and an official from Madhubani district, Bihar, India, a team that included border security forces from both countries, the Armed Police Force of Nepal, and SSB of India began placing border pillars after land measurement by technicians.Locals have raised concerns, stating that border pillars have been positioned, encroaching approximately 50 to 100 meters of land into Nepal compared to the previous position. Many like Ram Bujhaun are unaware of when these border pillars were placed.“I did not know that pillar was placed here. After I found out when I asked the village leaders, many said they were placing the border pillars as they pleased,” said Ram Bujhaun.He was told to carry on planting paddy and that it would not matter as these issues had happened in the past. “They encroached on my land and have asked me not to plant anything. This is gross injustice,” he says.Ram Bujhaun’s family owns a total of 4,000 square metres of land, with 2,000 square metres belonging to him and the remaining 2,000 square metres to his brother Bechan. However, 1,000 square metres of his land is now located on the Indian side after the demarcation. Despite this, he has been farming on the land and continues to pay taxes to the Department of Land Management and Archive in Nepal.“They have marked my land to be on the Indian side and placed border pillars on it. I’ve been farming till now but I don’t know when they will ask me to stop,” he says.Ignorance of the governmentThe Madhesh province in southern NepalThe former ward chair of Mukhiyapatti Musharniya Rural Municipality-5, Ram Naresh Yadav, said that over time, India has encroached on numerous Nepali lands in various locations in the Madhesh Province. This, he says, happened due to the Nepali administration’s ignorance and weak stature.“They (Nepali administration) were careless and that meant the Indian side placed these border pillars by encroaching on Nepali land,” says Ram Naresh.He said that over 40 farmers from wards 1, 5, and 6 have land ranging from 300 to 1,600 square metres on the Indian side. “These farmers have land ownership certificates, but they cannot farm as the SSB says the land is in India and not Nepal,” said Ram Naresh.In 1996, land ownership certificates were distributed after surveying the land in the border area. Local Dharmendra Kumar Yadav said that since then, the locals have been paying their land tax regularly. In 2018, when the pillar was being placed, the locals protested when they saw their land was being encroached on. However, since the demarcation had been agreed upon by high-ranking government officials of Nepal and India, the farmer’s voices went unheard.“We tried to stop when the border pillars were being placed on our land. But the administrators from both sides forcibly put it there without even trying to hold a discussion,” said Harish Chandra Yadav. The Chief District Officer of Dhanusha, Chakrapani Pandey, says that the border pillars were placed by the technical team after the measurements and with the agreement of the high-ranking officials of the two countries.“The fields and houses that are built in no man’s land have recently been cleared. No one can do anything in this particular area,” said Pandey. “We understand the people’s concern but we cannot do anything about it now.”",['cava men ’ volleybal : nepal finish tournament winless'],"['ram bujhaun yadav land ownership certif stand near border pillar say erron place land .', 'octob 2023 , 51-year-old ram bujhaun yadav musaharnia rural municipality-5 , mukhiyapatti , dhanusha , rel ’ hous , someon told two indian sashastra seema bal ( ssb ) personnel look him.anxi , rush home wonder look him . “ ask paddi field man ’ land mine .', 'told ye ask cut paddi immedi , ” said.th paddi ripe yadav ask time .', 'howev , ssb personnel told cut paddi immediately.ram bujhaun wife tetari devi 677-square-metr plot land .', 'nepal india reevalu border , ram bujhan ’ land deem near man ’ land two demarc pillars.frustr , ram bujhaun cut paddi due harvest .', ', ask plant anyth land fall man ’ land . “ border polic ’ say word .', '’ fight ssb , ” say ram bujhaun ad decid plan anyth land anymore.wo farmersmani farmer southern nepal say land place india recent demarc .', 'jamuna river , flow man ’ land nepal india , chang cours two decad ago , border pillar went miss .', 'local say pillar place encroach nepali land.in 2018 , chief district offic dhanusha , pradeep raj kandel , offici madhubani district , bihar , india , team includ border secur forc countri , arm polic forc nepal , ssb india began place border pillar land measur technicians.loc rais concern , state border pillar posit , encroach approxim 50 100 meter land nepal compar previou posit .', 'mani like ram bujhaun unawar border pillar place . “ know pillar place .', 'found ask villag leader , mani said place border pillar pleas , ” said ram bujhaun.h told carri plant paddi would matter issu happen past .', '“ encroach land ask plant anyth .', 'gross injustic , ” says.ram bujhaun ’ famili own total 4,000 squar metr land , 2,000 squar metr belong remain 2,000 squar metr brother bechan .', 'howev , 1,000 squar metr land locat indian side demarc .', 'despit , farm land continu pay tax depart land manag archiv nepal . “ mark land indian side place border pillar .', '’ farm till ’ know ask stop , ” says.ignor governmentth madhesh provinc southern nepalth former ward chair mukhiyapatti musharniya rural municipality-5 , ram naresh yadav , said time , india encroach numer nepali land variou locat madhesh provinc .', ', say , happen due nepali administr ’ ignor weak statur . “ ( nepali administr ) careless meant indian side place border pillar encroach nepali land , ” say ram naresh.h said 40 farmer ward 1 , 5 , 6 land rang 300 1,600 squar metr indian side .', '“ farmer land ownership certif , farm ssb say land india nepal , ” said ram naresh.in 1996 , land ownership certif distribut survey land border area .', 'local dharmendra kumar yadav said sinc , local pay land tax regularli .', '2018 , pillar place , local protest saw land encroach .', 'howev , sinc demarc agre upon high-rank govern offici nepal india , farmer ’ voic went unheard . “ tri stop border pillar place land .', 'administr side forcibl put without even tri hold discuss , ” said harish chandra yadav .', 'chief district offic dhanusha , chakrapani pandey , say border pillar place technic team measur agreement high-rank offici two countri . “ field hous built man ’ land recent clear .', 'one anyth particular area , ” said pandey .', '“ understand peopl ’ concern anyth . ”']"
Limbu and Rai win National Skateboard Championship,"Regenerative braking representational image. Photo: FreepikThe electric vehicle market in Nepal has grown significantly over the past year. Electric four-wheelers and two-wheelers are being launched almost every month, spanning from passenger to commercial vehicles. Electric transportation appears to be an emerging trend in the automotive industry.New EVs are regularly introduced with advanced features as car companies develop unique electric platforms. One standout feature is regenerative braking.Regenerative braking was first introduced in 1967 by the American Motor Car Company (AMC) in their prototype electric vehicle, the AMC Amitron. However, Toyota became the automobile manufacturer to implement regenerative braking system (RBS) technology in their Prius series hybrid vehicles in 1997. Toyota brought up the new hybrid technology in the Prius when fuel prices were going up at a massive rate. 1997 Toyota Prius Hybrid. Photo: ToyotaBut what is regenerative braking? There are still many people confused about what it is, whether it is safe or helpful in fuel economy in hybrid cars and the regeneration of electricity in electric cars.In simple terms, regen braking is when a car saves energy by recharging its battery when you brake, helping it use less fuel or electricity and go further. Easy but scientifically, regen braking is a process used in vehicles where the kinetic energy produced during braking is converted into electrical energy through an electric motor acting as a generator. This electrical energy is then stored in the vehicle’s battery for later use, reducing energy wastage and increasing overall efficiency.Photo: FreepikRegen braking can be seen in all kinds of EVs, including cars, scooters, commercial vans, buses, bicycles, three-wheelers, and rickshaws. It now can be electrically managed to what extent the power and braking can be generated. Regenerative Braking work process in EVPrinciple of Operation: Regene braking works by turning the energy from slowing down into electricity.Electric Motor as a Generator: In EV or hybrid cars with regen braking, the motor changes roles from moving the car to making electricity when you brake.Switching Polarity: When you brake, the motor switches directions, turning energy from the wheels into electricity instead of using it to move the car.Generation of Electricity: The turning wheels make the motor produce electricity, which goes to the car’s battery.Power Electronics: Special electronics change the electricity from the motor into the right kind for charging the battery.Battery Charging: The electricity made during braking charges up the car’s battery, storing the energy for later.Integration with Hydraulic Braking System: Regenerative braking works with the regular brakes, blending them for smooth stopping.Photo: automotive-iqAdvantages and Disadvantages of Regenerative Braking The advantages are listed below:Energy Efficiency: Regenerative braking efficiently captures the kinetic energy generated during braking, effectively reducing energy wastage and contributing to a more sustainable driving experience.Extended Range: By using the energy that would otherwise be lost during braking as heat and sound, regenerative braking helps to extend the driving range of electric vehicles in instances such as travelling downhill. Reduced Brake Wear: Regenerative braking minimizes the strain on traditional braking components, mitigating wear and tear, and potentially extending the lifespan of the braking components such as brake pads, rotors and brake lines, thus reducing maintenance costs over time.Enhanced Driving Experience: Regenerative braking provides a smoother braking experience and a more responsive feel to drivers, enhancing overall driving comfort and control on the road.The disadvantages are listed below:Limited Effectiveness at Low Speeds: While regenerative braking efficiently recaptures energy during braking, its effectiveness diminishes at lower speeds which leads to decreased energy recovery compared to higher speeds.Complexity and Cost: Implementing regenerative braking adds complexity and cost to vehicle systems, potentially raising manufacturing and maintenance expenses, and impacting consumer affordability.Maintenance Requirements: Regenerative braking systems require periodic maintenance and calibration to ensure they operate optimally.Efficiency Variability: Regenerative braking may exhibit variability in efficiency under extreme weather conditions or on certain road surfaces, leading to fluctuations in overall energy recapture and impacting the vehicle’s efficiency.MisconceptionsFully Recharges Battery: Some mistakenly believe that regenerative braking fully replenishes the battery, but in reality, it only adds a modest amount of charge.Increases Braking Distances: There is a misconception that regenerative braking extends braking distances, but it enhances braking performance by complementing traditional brakes.High-Speed Only: While more effective at higher speeds, regenerative braking still functions at lower speeds, such as during city driving or stop-and-go traffic.Maintenance-Free: Despite requiring less maintenance than traditional brakes, regen braking systems still need periodic checks and maintenance to ensure proper operation.Significantly Boosts Range: While regen braking contributes to extending the driving range of electric vehicles, its impact is influenced by various factors beyond just braking efficiency.Only for Electric Cars: Although commonly associated with electric vehicles, regen braking systems are also found in some conventional vehicles, particularly those aiming to improve fuel efficiency with advanced technology.Photo: FreepikRegenerative braking might sound complicated, but it is pretty cool. Think of it as a way for EVs and hybrids to recycle energy when they slow down. Instead of just wasting that energy, regenerative braking turns it into electricity, which can then be used to power the battery.",['limbu rai win nation skateboard championship'],"['regen brake represent imag .', 'photo : freepikth electr vehicl market nepal grown significantli past year .', 'electr four-wheel two-wheel launch almost everi month , span passeng commerci vehicl .', 'electr transport appear emerg trend automot industry.new ev regularli introduc advanc featur car compani develop uniqu electr platform .', 'one standout featur regen braking.regen brake first introduc 1967 american motor car compani ( amc ) prototyp electr vehicl , amc amitron .', 'howev , toyota becam automobil manufactur implement regen brake system ( rb ) technolog priu seri hybrid vehicl 1997 .', 'toyota brought new hybrid technolog priu fuel price go massiv rate .', '1997 toyota priu hybrid .', 'photo : toyotabut regen brake ?', 'still mani peopl confus , whether safe help fuel economi hybrid car regener electr electr cars.in simpl term , regen brake car save energi recharg batteri brake , help use less fuel electr go .', 'easi scientif , regen brake process use vehicl kinet energi produc brake convert electr energi electr motor act gener .', 'electr energi store vehicl ’ batteri later use , reduc energi wastag increas overal efficiency.photo : freepikregen brake seen kind ev , includ car , scooter , commerci van , buse , bicycl , three-wheel , rickshaw .', 'electr manag extent power brake gener .', 'regen brake work process evprincipl oper : regen brake work turn energi slow electricity.electr motor gener : ev hybrid car regen brake , motor chang role move car make electr brake.switch polar : brake , motor switch direct , turn energi wheel electr instead use move car.gener electr : turn wheel make motor produc electr , goe car ’ battery.pow electron : special electron chang electr motor right kind charg battery.batteri charg : electr made brake charg car ’ batteri , store energi later.integr hydraul brake system : regen brake work regular brake , blend smooth stopping.photo : automotive-iqadvantag disadvantag regen brake advantag list : energi effici : regen brake effici captur kinet energi gener brake , effect reduc energi wastag contribut sustain drive experience.extend rang : use energi would otherwis lost brake heat sound , regen brake help extend drive rang electr vehicl instanc travel downhil .', 'reduc brake wear : regen brake minim strain tradit brake compon , mitig wear tear , potenti extend lifespan brake compon brake pad , rotor brake line , thu reduc mainten cost time.enhanc drive experi : regen brake provid smoother brake experi respons feel driver , enhanc overal drive comfort control road.th disadvantag list : limit effect low speed : regen brake effici recaptur energi brake , effect diminish lower speed lead decreas energi recoveri compar higher speeds.complex cost : implement regen brake add complex cost vehicl system , potenti rais manufactur mainten expens , impact consum affordability.mainten requir : regen brake system requir period mainten calibr ensur oper optimally.effici variabl : regen brake may exhibit variabl effici extrem weather condit certain road surfac , lead fluctuat overal energi recaptur impact vehicl ’ efficiency.misconceptions recharg batteri : mistakenli believ regen brake fulli replenish batteri , realiti , add modest amount charge.increas brake distanc : misconcept regen brake extend brake distanc , enhanc brake perform complement tradit brakes.high-spe : effect higher speed , regen brake still function lower speed , citi drive stop-and-go traffic.maintenance-fre : despit requir less mainten tradit brake , regen brake system still need period check mainten ensur proper operation.significantli boost rang : regen brake contribut extend drive rang electr vehicl , impact influenc variou factor beyond brake efficiency.onli electr car : although commonli associ electr vehicl , regen brake system also found convent vehicl , particularli aim improv fuel effici advanc technology.photo : freepikregen brake might sound complic , pretti cool .', 'think way ev hybrid recycl energi slow .', 'instead wast energi , regen brake turn electr , use power batteri .']"
Nepal crash out of SAFF Championship after losing 2-0 to India,"The snow leopard rescued from Urlabari is currently being kept at the Central Zoo in Lalitpur. Photo: Aryan DhimalAs the gates to the vet clinic at the Central Zoo in Lalitpur opened, more than two dozen photojournalists thronged the facility and surrounded a metal cage aiming their DSLR cameras at a snow leopard inside.“Please don’t come close to the animal,” the zoo’s vet, Radha Krishna Gharti, told approaching photojournalists. But in the gush of excitement to take exclusive photographs of the elusive cat, difficult to spot even in its prime habitats, there were few takers for the word of caution.Nepal’s Department of National Parks and Wildlife Conservation (DNPWC) organised the photo-op two days after the male subadult cat, which was until recently found in the country only at altitudes higher than 2,000-6,000 metres above sea level, was brought to the zoo from Urlabari town(146 m above sea level). According to the department, the animal has sustained injuries to its right foreleg and cannot stand upright.Although officials involved said they are looking at releasing the animal into the wild after it recuperates, doing so will be a daunting task, adding that the zoo may be the only place where it can now survive.Not a wild catReporters and photojournalists take photos of a snow leopard being held at the Central Zoo in Lalitpur, Nepal. Image by Abhaya Raj Joshi/ Mongabay“Nepali snow leopard experts have come up with two hypotheses to explain how the animal from the mountains landed up in the plains,” said Sharad Chandra Adhikari, member-secretary at the National Trust for Nature Conservation (NTNC), a semi-government body that manages the zoo in Lalitpur, a town in the Kathmandu Valley. The first of the two hypotheses made public during the photo-op-cum-press conference, is that it was raised in captivity and somehow managed to escape into the wild. The second is that it lost its orientation while trying to establish its territory after separating from its mother.Kulbhushansingh Suryawanshi, director of the India program, Snow Leopard Trust, said that both hypotheses are plausible explanations as to how the snow leopard got to the plains in Nepal.A DNPWC official, who wished to remain anonymous as he is not authorised to talk to the press, said that it was more likely that the animal had been raised in captivity. “The way it sipped the water and ate the food zoo staff offered indicates that it may have been raised in captivity,” the official said.Snow leopards are shy cats living at extreme altitudes in the steep mountainous areas of 12 countries in Central and South Asia. Their global population spread over altitudes of 500-5,800 m, is estimated to be between around 3,900 and 6,000 as detailed coordinated surveys of the population in the range countries are yet to be carried out. In Nepal, their population divided into three blocks (eastern, central and western) is estimated to be between 301 and 400.Adhikari from NTNC said that researchers will now examine the animal’s scat to analyse its diet and try to find out whether it was roaming in the wild or had been in some sort of captivity. Researchers are also preparing to analyse its genes to try to find out to which of the three metapopulations in Nepal it belongs. They will also observe the animal’s canine teeth and fur to look for clues.Relocation challenge A snow leopard found in Urlabari town in Nepal’s plains in a cage at the Central Zoo in Kathmandu. Photo: Aryan DhimalThe whole process could take a few months to complete, and summer could set in in Kathmandu by then, officials concede. “The current temperature in Kathmandu is suitable for snow leopards, as we are in the peak of winter,” said Madhu Chetri, a snow leopard researcher from NTNC. But that could change as spring season begins in the Northern Hemisphere.The DNPWC official said that regardless of the findings related to how the animal got to Urlabarli, the animal would have spent a significant amount of time with humans during its recovery phase. “That would mean that it would have gotten habituated with having humans around,” the official said.Sending such animals back into the wild is a challenge, as they may have lost their hunting and other adaptation skills, he added. In May last year, officials at the Chitwan National Park released two rescued rhino calves into the wild, with limited success. The safety of the animals, which had gotten used to having humans around, was compromised as poachers could easily approach and kill them. Eventually, they were transferred to an enclosure in eastern Nepal away from human intervention.Veteran conservationist Professor Karan Bahadur Shah said that rewilding the snow leopard would be a daunting task, as the animals are territorial. “If we just leave the animal in its natural habitat, it will get killed by other snow leopards defending their territory,” he said. “The best option would be to keep the animal in the zoo for the public to see.”But Nepal’s Central Zoo has its own set of problems. The facility, established in 1932 as a private collection, has limited space and has frequently run into financial trouble. Conservationists say the snow leopard would need special facilities to cater to its needs.“If the government decides that the snow leopard needs to remain at the zoo, we are ready to shoulder the responsibility,” said Adhikari. “We have set up special facilities for animals such as the red panda and chimpanzees,” he said. “We can do that for the snow leopard as well.”Those advocating for keeping the animal in the zoo also said that Nepal is a snow leopard range country and the public, especially the young generation, also needs to see the different animals found in the country. “It has great educational value,” said Shah.Snow leopard expert Suryawanshi from neighbouring India also said that it would be challenging to release the animal into the wild. “If the team at the zoo can establish the exact cause of this behaviour [why it ventured into the plains] and can keep the animal away from human contact, then it might be okay to release it back,” he said. “But otherwise, there is little hope for it in the wild. Better to let it live in the zoo.”Back at the zoo, after the photojournalists are done taking photos, it is the turn of the reporters to point their smartphones at the animal. Then there is a contingent of senior wildlife department officials waiting in line to catch a glimpse of the animal. “So much for keeping it away from human contact,” a conservationist observing the hullabaloo from a distance said.This story first appeared on Mongabay and Onlinekhabar is republishing it under a Creative Commons licence.",['nepal crash saff championship lose 2-0 india'],"['snow leopard rescu urlabari current kept central zoo lalitpur .', 'photo : aryan dhimala gate vet clinic central zoo lalitpur open , two dozen photojournalist throng facil surround metal cage aim dslr camera snow leopard insid . “ pleas ’ come close anim , ” zoo ’ vet , radha krishna gharti , told approach photojournalist .', 'gush excit take exclus photograph elus cat , difficult spot even prime habitat , taker word caution.nep ’ depart nation park wildlif conserv ( dnpwc ) organis photo-op two day male subadult cat , recent found countri altitud higher 2,000-6,000 metr sea level , brought zoo urlabari town ( 146 sea level ) .', 'accord depart , anim sustain injuri right foreleg stand upright.although offici involv said look releas anim wild recuper , daunt task , ad zoo may place survive.not wild catreport photojournalist take photo snow leopard held central zoo lalitpur , nepal .', 'imag abhaya raj joshi/ mongabay “ nepali snow leopard expert come two hypothes explain anim mountain land plain , ” said sharad chandra adhikari , member-secretari nation trust natur conserv ( ntnc ) , semi-govern bodi manag zoo lalitpur , town kathmandu valley .', 'first two hypothes made public photo-op-cum-press confer , rais captiv somehow manag escap wild .', 'second lost orient tri establish territori separ mother.kulbhushansingh suryawanshi , director india program , snow leopard trust , said hypothes plausibl explan snow leopard got plain nepal.a dnpwc offici , wish remain anonym authoris talk press , said like anim rais captiv .', '“ way sip water ate food zoo staff offer indic may rais captiv , ” offici said.snow leopard shi cat live extrem altitud steep mountain area 12 countri central south asia .', 'global popul spread altitud 500-5,800 , estim around 3,900 6,000 detail coordin survey popul rang countri yet carri .', 'nepal , popul divid three block ( eastern , central western ) estim 301 400.adhikari ntnc said research examin anim ’ scat analys diet tri find whether roam wild sort captiv .', 'research also prepar analys gene tri find three metapopul nepal belong .', 'also observ anim ’ canin teeth fur look clues.reloc challeng snow leopard found urlabari town nepal ’ plain cage central zoo kathmandu .', 'photo : aryan dhimalth whole process could take month complet , summer could set kathmandu , offici conced .', '“ current temperatur kathmandu suitabl snow leopard , peak winter , ” said madhu chetri , snow leopard research ntnc .', 'could chang spring season begin northern hemisphere.th dnpwc offici said regardless find relat anim got urlabarli , anim would spent signific amount time human recoveri phase .', '“ would mean would gotten habitu human around , ” offici said.send anim back wild challeng , may lost hunt adapt skill , ad .', 'may last year , offici chitwan nation park releas two rescu rhino calv wild , limit success .', 'safeti anim , gotten use human around , compromis poacher could easili approach kill .', 'eventu , transfer enclosur eastern nepal away human intervention.veteran conservationist professor karan bahadur shah said rewild snow leopard would daunt task , anim territori .', '“ leav anim natur habitat , get kill snow leopard defend territori , ” said .', '“ best option would keep anim zoo public see . ” nepal ’ central zoo set problem .', 'facil , establish 1932 privat collect , limit space frequent run financi troubl .', 'conservationist say snow leopard would need special facil cater need . “ govern decid snow leopard need remain zoo , readi shoulder respons , ” said adhikari .', '“ set special facil anim red panda chimpanze , ” said .', '“ snow leopard well . ” advoc keep anim zoo also said nepal snow leopard rang countri public , especi young gener , also need see differ anim found countri .', '“ great educ valu , ” said shah.snow leopard expert suryawanshi neighbour india also said would challeng releas anim wild .', '“ team zoo establish exact caus behaviour [ ventur plain ] keep anim away human contact , might okay releas back , ” said .', '“ otherwis , littl hope wild .', 'better let live zoo . ” back zoo , photojournalist done take photo , turn report point smartphon anim .', 'conting senior wildlif depart offici wait line catch glimps anim .', '“ much keep away human contact , ” conservationist observ hullabaloo distanc said.thi stori first appear mongabay onlinekhabar republish creativ common licenc .']"
ICC Cricket World Cup Qualifier: Netherlands knock Nepal out of the tournament,"The National Assembly was formed to give experienced people a chance to be part of the parliament and help during the formation of important bills. In countries that follow the Westminster model of government, the upper house plays an important role. That, however, is not the case in Nepal as the country’s upper house has become a platform where individuals secure positions in the National Assembly based on their connections. As the election nears, many once again question the relevance and existence of the upper house.Things were different in the past as the initial years of the National Assembly saw experienced politicians and experts others in their field be nominated for the post. That slowly changed as the first batch completed its two-year term.“I understand why people are frustrated with the upper house. People expected experts but all we got was party cadres who lacked knowledge or experience,” says Bimala Rai Paudyal a National Assembly member. “Considering such behaviour and practices, what distinguishes the House of Representatives from the National Assembly?”A loser’s second chance Narayan Kaji Shrestha, who faced defeat in the 2017 general election from Gorkha-2, was elected as a member of the National Assembly on January 23, 2020. Elected from Gandaki Province, Shrestha currently is the Deputy Prime Minister and Home Minister of the country.Bhagwati Neupane who lost the election from Gandaki province and Bimala Ghimire who lost the election for mayorship in Bhanu Municipality also shared the same trajectory.Similarly, Mrigendra Kumar Singh Yadav and Jag Prasad Sharma were defeated in the House of Representatives elections, from Saptari-4 and Dang-3 respectively are now members of the National Assembly. Bam Dev Gautam, who lost the elections from Bardiya, secured a place in the upper house through nomination by President Bidya Devi Bhandari.Even those who did not win as ward member(s) got the opportunity to become members of the National Assembly including Sindh Bahadur Bishwakarma who was appointed on February 7, 2018. He is soon leaving his post on March 3.Despite the repeated criticisms, the political parties have not paid attention to this concern posed by political leaders and the general public. The latest proof of this is the list of candidates for the National Assembly elections scheduled on January 25. The list contains names like Krishna Prasad Sitaula, defeated in the House of Representatives elections in 2022 from Koshi Province, and Pooja Chaudhary, who lost in the provincial assembly elections 2022 from Rautahat-3 (a).Speaker Ganesh Prasad Timilsina, who led the National Assembly for the entire six years under the federal system, is also dissatisfied with the individuals who have made it to the upper house. “The allegations are something for the parties to ponder upon. The leaders should have prioritised involving intellectuals/neutrals rather than managing its members,” he says.The 59-member National Assembly elects eight representatives, equally from all seven provinces, with an additional three individuals nominated by the President. The Constitution ensures representation of women, Dalits, minorities or disabled communities, envisioning that experts, experienced individuals, and the most qualified people from various fields will become members of the National Assembly.Easy way inFile: A National Assembly meetingThere are some reasons why leaders aspire to join the upper house, and even the leadership create opportunities for them. In National Assembly elections, voters consist of local-level heads/deputy heads and provincial assembly members. Typically, individuals seeking these positions undergo a vetting process by their respective parties. As a result, aspiring members of parliament can focus less on persuading individual voters and more on gaining party support to secure their candidacy. Moreover, being a member of the National Assembly opens avenues to ministerial roles. The constitution prohibits a National Assembly member from becoming the Prime Minister, but not Deputy Prime Minister. Due to such opportunities, leaders are enticed to seek a position in the assembly.The National Assembly is currently in its fourth election cycle since the promulgation of the Consitution in 2015. Scheduled for January 25, this election aims to fill 19 seats vacated by individuals completing their six-year terms. The previous election cycles took place in 2017, involving 56 members, followed by 2019 with 18 positions, and 2020 with 19 positions.The cascading impactsFile: A National Assembly meetingAnother reason why the National Assembly is finding it difficult to justify itself is that it has become a shadow of the House of Representatives. The meeting of the National Assembly did not have one session when the House of Representatives was dissolved by then Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli twice. The demands and issues raised by the opposition parties in the House of Representatives automatically went to the National Assembly, where the parliamentarians of the ruling party put forward any proposal, they endorse it the same as in the House of Representatives.The latest example – is the main opposition UML did not allow the meeting of the House of Representatives to continue for five days from July 5, 2023, due to a statement made by Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal during his visit to India. Consequently, the meeting of the National Assembly was also paused during that period.The UML obstructed the House of Representatives for almost a month starting mid-July last year demanding a high-level inquiry committee to probe the 60-kilogram gold smuggling case and the resignation of the Home Minister. The National Assembly followed suit with leaders pushing their agendas forward.Speaker Ganesh Timilsina himself is dissatisfied that every behaviour and activity of the House of Representatives influence the National Assembly. He says despite his attempts to prevent the overshadowing, it has been unfortunate that he did not garner the goodwill of the top leaders during political disputes.Reinstating powerThe National Assembly is a permanent institution. Therefore, it can remain operational even in the absence of the House of Representatives. Under normal circumstances, Speaker Timilsina initiated a positive practice by personally participating in different committees. Nevertheless, in the absence of the House of Representatives, the National Assembly often experienced inactivity.In December 2020, the Prime Minister at that time, KP Sharma Oli, dissolved the House of Representatives. Subsequently, a session of the National Assembly was convened on January 1, 2021. Despite lasting only seven hours over four days, this session, which took place after the dissolution, failed to address crucial public issues. Even after six months, important matters remained unaddressed within the House.On May 22, 2021, the UML-led government once again dissolved the House of Representatives. The meeting of the National Assembly and committees was affected once more. However, the dissolutions were declared unconstitutional by the Supreme Court, reinstating the parliament.The Constitution says that despite the closing of the National Assembly session, thematic committee meetings can still take place. However, both the National Assembly and its committees remained inactive until the restoration of the House of Representatives.According to Khimlal Devkota, a member of the National Assembly, when the House of Representatives was dissolved twice, it seemed that the National Assembly was also in a state of dissolution.Bimala Rai Paudyal also believes that the inability to resume the upper house is a mark of weakness. “Since the government was not in a position to call, the President needed to be consulted by the chair together with the consultation committee. That was not done either,” she says.Constitutional and legal distinctionsExcept for the Constitution of Nepal (1962) and the Interim Constitution of Nepal (2007), all other constitutions in Nepal provided for a bicameral parliament with the National Assembly or the Upper House and the House of Representatives or the Lower House. The practices before 2015 were under the unitary governance system, but after the adoption of the federal democratic republican governance system, the role of the National Assembly has changed somewhat.In the preamble of the constitution prepared by the ‘Constituent Assembly, and Administrative Organ Designation Committee’ during the drafting of the constitution, it is mentioned that some different qualifications have been prescribed for being a member of the House of Representatives and the National Assembly, with the intention that qualified people can be represented in the National Assembly.Chair of the National Assembly Ganesh Prasad Timilsina restates that the members of the upper house should be assessed based on the country’s expectations with clear criteria. There is no definite definition of an expert in the constitution. It has been stated symbolically, “…It is expected that the members should have some basic skills to face the challenges and fulfil their responsibilities.”According to the constitution, the responsibility of the National Assembly is to correctly establish the rights of the local level, state, and union, and to prevent the House of Representatives from trying to enact laws contrary to the spirit of federalism. There is an explanatory comment in the constitution about the propriety of the National Assembly – “This House is expected to fulfil its role to maintain creative and mutual relations between the national government and the provinces.”In addition, there are some constitutional and legal differences regarding the National Assembly. But the MPs are demanding that it should cease. When a bill originating in the House of Representatives is passed and sent to the National Assembly, and if the latter does not decide within 60 days, it proceeds de facto.This has placed the National Assembly in a dilemma. The Chairman of the National Assembly, Timilsina, says, “Such an arrangement should also apply to the House of Representatives, or both should be equal.”Need for course correction PM Pushpa Kamal Dahal speaking in the National Assembly meeting.Some instances have turned these so-called experts into a laughing stock due to their actions. On July 5, 2023,  a discussion on the Electronic Commerce (E-Commerce) Bill 2023 was tabled in the National Assembly. However, the parliamentarians misunderstood the main point and instead discussed the matter of electricity. The MPs, who had not read the proposal, suggested that electricity consumption within Nepal should also be increased besides exporting electricity to India and Bangladesh.During the meeting, Ramesh Rijal, the Minister of Industry, Commerce and Supplies, also mentioned that India would purchase electricity during the Prime Minister’s visit. Unfortunately, the bill was unanimously approved.Timilsina considers the incident an example, that in his six-year tenure, he does not want to remember. Som Bahadur Thapa, a former secretary at the Parliament Secretariat, termed the incident ‘a joke’ in the Parliament of Nepal. “This is strong proof of the kind of MPs we have, who speak without knowing what they are talking about.” Timilsina assumed the role of the speaker/chair of the National Assembly after the establishment of the Federal Democratic Republic. He had the opportunity to establish the system and the dignity of the National Assembly. However, instead of setting a positive example, he will soon be retiring after being accused of playing tricks with the Speaker and showing interest in the work of the House of Representatives.Timilsina has repeatedly commented on the affairs of the House of Representatives. The latest instance was during a seminar on ‘Japan: Past, Present, and Future’ held in the capital on December 2, 2023, he publicly stated that the election results of the House of Representatives did not bode well.Pointing to the emergence of a new party and the victory of some independent candidates, he said, “In a democracy, you get to choose candidates, irrespective of their party affiliation. However, is the signal positive?”In August/ September 2022, Timilsina wrote a letter to the Election Commission, urging them to extend the tenure of Speaker and Deputy Speaker. Upon receiving a response stating that the Commission would not determine the tenure of the elected Parliament, Timilsina directed the Parliament Secretariat not to execute decisions made by the Management Committee after September 17, 2022.This created conflict between the Speaker of the House of Representatives and the Speaker of the National Assembly and in the crux of this dispute between the parties, the country had to bear the consequences of this conflict. Laws could not be enacted promptly, and the place once considered the domain of experts was overshadowed by the party’s interest. A study conducted by the Democracy Resource Center Nepal (DRCN) on the legislative functioning of the National Assembly has revealed that the Upper House has passed some bills that go against the spirit of federalism.The report’s concluding remarks say, “…the bills passed by the House of Representatives have not undergone significant changes or discussions in the National Assembly. The conclusion section of the study states that – “Furthermore, some bills, contradicting the spirit of federalism and addressing the interests of interest groups, have been approved by the National Assembly.”Overall, in the last six years, parties have introduced individuals who, given their presentation level, have raised questions about the National Assembly’s justification. If there are no changes in the constitution, laws, and policies concerning the upper assembly, these concerns will persist.”",['icc cricket world cup qualifi : netherland knock nepal

ICC Cricket World Cup Qualifier: West Indies prove too good for Nepal,"Representational image Photo by Tanushree Rao on UnsplashWhile most of the nation was preparing for the festival of lights, Tihar in early November 2023, something no less exciting was fuelling our sparks from oceans away. A queer art festival was happening for the seventeenth year and we had a chance to attend it as delegates. Our delegation was made possible through the collaboration between the Outburst Arts, an art organisation based in Northern Ireland, UK and the British Council, Nepal.There is a clear distinction between cities in terms of their flourishing arts scenes, and this became apparent during a visit to Belfast, Northern Ireland, specifically for the Outburst Queer Arts Festival held in the charming city centre. The organisation of such a festival requires months of careful preparation and planning.The queer art festival started as short events lasting a few days. Now, after 17 years, it has grown into a ten-day festival with panel discussions, theatre performances, and exhibitions. Program guides were available at venues, partner hotels, local libraries, and shops. Many delegates, including us, came from outside Northern Ireland to attend.During the queer art festival, we had the opportunity to connect with art curators, publishers, artists, and representatives from other British Council departments around the world (Lithuania, France, South Africa, Turkey, Greece, Jordan, England, and Argentina to name a few.) Each event that we attended gave us a different insight into what the arts can do and how it can facilitate connections. We gained insights from queer publishers and art curators on the challenges they face in their own countries due to resources and sometimes from bureaucracy in systems. We also got to see the way people can thrive when given a platform to showcase their works, such as an art exhibition in which the artist reimagined intimacy for queer people.On the other hand, Nepal struggles by and large at times for queer visibility. There are no explicit spaces for SOGIESC (Sexual Orientation, Gender Identity and Expressions and Sex Characteristics) artists to showcase their works nor openly come together as a community, it all exists in pocket spaces. In the same way, something that struck us was the presence of older queer artists at the festival. It was not just for one particular event during the queer art festival. We noticed an active participation and involvement of older queer people throughout the festival there. It was fascinating to see queer artists in their 40s and 50s share their transformative and inspiring work. Whereas, back home, the queer folks at the forefront of queer art, advocacy and activism are mostly Gen-Zs and millennials. We have very few queer elders that we can count on our fingers who are diligently working for Nepali queer folks. Even among them, some still hold onto archaic notions and refuse to evolve and embrace changes. So, there’s that.From dream to realityDuring the queer art festival, we had the opportunity to connect with art curators, publishers and artists. Photo by Raphael Renter | @raphi_rawr on UnsplashBefore being selected as delegates, both of us joined online meetings with British Council Nepal and the Outburst representatives facilitated through Kaalo 101 (an art space in Patan), along with interested queer artists from Nepal. We had a total of three meetings where we discussed the possibilities and challenges of doing a queer art festival in Nepal. The discourse also entailed us sharing a presentation about the updates of the queer art scene in Nepal in the last five years. The updates included memorable leaps taken in queer arts from music to literature and fashion and more by artists from diverse walks of life. Days after the third meeting, the British Council extended invitations to us to attend the Outburst Queer Arts Festival.Our delegation is just one example of the transcontinental collaboration because it was something that happened for the first time and involved us. But, Outburst Arts and the British Council have been practising cross-continental collaboration for years. Even in this year’s festival, we witnessed a lot of artists from different continents work together in exhibitions, lectures, panel discussions, magazines and so on. The amalgamation introduced us to brilliant thought-provoking work that defies gender and sociopolitical norms. The power of transcontinental collaboration was beyond beautiful.Imagining queer arts in NepalPhoto by Nikolas Gannon on UnsplashThe queer art scene in Nepal is an emerging one. While a full-fledged festival may not be possible now, something small yet significant is achievable. Time and again, different organisations have been running large art exhibitions/tours for weeks and months. However, in the microcosm that is Nepal, especially Kathmandu, the capital is no stranger to art-oriented programs. What it has been unfamiliar with precisely is queer art. And the unfamiliarity is not something induced by the lack of queer artists and their art. Sadly, it is because of inadequate platforms, space and resources to pursue queer arts.Despite this, through the years there have been events and literature that have emerged centring on queer identity, but it has not come without its challenges. On collections of stories, “Pride Climbing Higher” and “Songs of Revolution” showcase stories from Nepalis across Nepal. There are not many stories reflecting the Nepali queer experiences otherwise. June Pride Parade by Queer Youth Group has gained momentum as well in the past few years since its conception, from a small gathering to now a large parade with performances from community members. The same can be said about Blue Diamond Society’s (BDS) Rainbow Visibility Pride events in August during the festival of Saa-Paru (Gai Jatra) which has been running for well over a decade; in recent years they have included flash mobs and interaction programmes as well in lead up to their parade. Individuals within the community have also organised their queer gatherings with friends, thus coming back to the cosmos of pocket spaces in celebrating queerness.While artists like us are creative with what we want to put out, we still need organisations like the British Council to foster spaces and connections to enable us to do that. Then and again, artists have come together and collaborated on queer-centric projects. But, we need funding and resources to achieve bigger-scale projects that unite more artists and transcend borders.Both of us advocate for queer rights and are involved in programs and activities that push the narrative further, extend the visibility of the community and normalise conversations surrounding queerness. Among other things, we are also the founders of Queering The Bond, a networking collective for Nepali queer folks and Shuby is also the founder of Queer Honky-Tonk, a platform to promote queer performances and networking with events such as a drag show or open mic every few months. However, both of us, individually or collaboratively can only do so much. The challenges of living in a capitalistic world oftentimes outweigh the passion we have for the queer art scene in Nepal. And this is where we expect the government and organisations to step up with policies, platforms and programs to provide spaces, opportunities and resources for queer artists. Here, the British Council joined hands with Outburst Arts, which paved the way for our delegation. We would not have known about the marvellous queer art festival at the other end of the world otherwise.Besides the limitations brought by insufficient spaces and social unawareness, the centralised capital does hinder queer artists from outside the city to connect, create and collaborate. Art already is centralised and elitist. On top of that, the concentrated Kathmandu Valley is of no help when it comes to making art accessible beyond its borders.Furthermore, there is also the expectation from basically everyone to have the perfect festival that caters to all people’s needs and wants. While the festival, if it should happen, is bound to be done with the right intentions, there is a lot of pressure for the first-time event itself. The festival will be inclusive and diverse. But, realistically speaking, it would be a struggle to make it relevant to each queer person from east to west.Speaking of struggles, a visceral feeling of uneasiness swarmed over me with each step I took while exiting the airport after the flight back home. I, Birat, personally felt that I could not be as free or unrestrained in Nepal as I was during my time in Belfast. No wonder a lot of the queer people we know opt for abroad.Seventeen years ago, when the Outburst Queer Arts Festival first began, it certainly was not as celebrated or large as it is now. What we are trying to convey here is that we do not have to start big. We can aim for something small yet promising. While there might be expectations to check all the boxes, it is crucial to be mindful of our capacity as well. But, we can be capacitated and this is where you – people in power, art enthusiasts, grant and resource allocators and media come in. It is time we all believe in Nepali queer art and create space for it to not only survive but thrive. It is imperative to understand that formulating our imagination into reality can only be possible through unwavering collaboration.",['icc cricket world cup qualifi : west indi prove good nepal'],"['represent imag photo tanushre rao unsplashwhil nation prepar festiv light , tihar earli novemb 2023 , someth less excit fuell spark ocean away .', 'queer art festiv happen seventeenth year chanc attend deleg .', 'deleg made possibl collabor outburst art , art organis base northern ireland , uk british council , nepal.ther clear distinct citi term flourish art scene , becam appar visit belfast , northern ireland , specif outburst queer art festiv held charm citi centr .', 'organis festiv requir month care prepar planning.th queer art festiv start short event last day .', ', 17 year , grown ten-day festiv panel discuss , theatr perform , exhibit .', 'program guid avail venu , partner hotel , local librari , shop .', 'mani deleg , includ us , came outsid northern ireland attend.dur queer art festiv , opportun connect art curat , publish , artist , repres british council depart around world ( lithuania , franc , south africa , turkey , greec , jordan , england , argentina name . )', 'event attend gave us differ insight art facilit connect .', 'gain insight queer publish art curat challeng face countri due resourc sometim bureaucraci system .', 'also got see way peopl thrive given platform showcas work , art exhibit artist reimagin intimaci queer people.on hand , nepal struggl larg time queer visibl .', 'explicit space sogiesc ( sexual orient , gender ident express sex characterist ) artist showcas work openli come togeth commun , exist pocket space .', 'way , someth struck us presenc older queer artist festiv .', 'one particular event queer art festiv .', 'notic activ particip involv older queer peopl throughout festiv .', 'fascin see queer artist 40 50 share transform inspir work .', 'wherea , back home , queer folk forefront queer art , advocaci activ mostli gen-z millenni .', 'queer elder count finger dilig work nepali queer folk .', 'even among , still hold onto archaic notion refus evolv embrac chang .', ', ’ that.from dream realitydur queer art festiv , opportun connect art curat , publish artist .', 'photo raphael renter | @ raphi_rawr unsplashbefor select deleg , us join onlin meet british council nepal outburst repres facilit kaalo 101 ( art space patan ) , along interest queer artist nepal .', 'total three meet discuss possibl challeng queer art festiv nepal .', 'discours also entail us share present updat queer art scene nepal last five year .', 'updat includ memor leap taken queer art music literatur fashion artist divers walk life .', 'day third meet , british council extend invit us attend outburst queer art festival.our deleg one exampl transcontinent collabor someth happen first time involv us .', ', outburst art british council practis cross-continent collabor year .', 'even year ’ festiv , wit lot artist differ contin work togeth exhibit , lectur , panel discuss , magazin .', 'amalgam introduc us brilliant thought-provok work defi gender sociopolit norm .', 'power transcontinent collabor beyond beautiful.imagin queer art nepalphoto nikola gannon unsplashth queer art scene nepal emerg one .', 'full-fledg festiv may possibl , someth small yet signific achiev .', 'time , differ organis run larg art exhibitions/tour week month .', 'howev , microcosm nepal , especi kathmandu , capit stranger art-ori program .', 'unfamiliar precis queer art .', 'unfamiliar someth induc lack queer artist art .', 'sadli , inadequ platform , space resourc pursu queer arts.despit , year event literatur emerg centr queer ident , come without challeng .', 'collect stori , “ pride climb higher ” “ song revolut ” showcas stori nepali across nepal .', 'mani stori reflect nepali queer experi otherwis .', 'june pride parad queer youth group gain momentum well past year sinc concept , small gather larg parad perform commun member .', 'said blue diamond societi ’ ( bd ) rainbow visibl pride event august festiv saa-paru ( gai jatra ) run well decad ;

Sabitra Bhandari: South Asia’s best looking to take the Israeli league by storm,"The month of January saw major road accidents in different parts of the country, including Lamhi in Dang, Dhorpatan in Baglung, and Chandragiri in Kathmandu. Road accidents have been common throughout the country with Nepal Police data suggesting over 2,500 people dying in them annually. Despite this, the Ministry of Finance has shown reluctance to introduce the proposed Road Safety Bill to reduce traffic accidents, fatalities, and serious injuries, and enhance road safety. Instead, the Finance Ministry has asked the Ministry of Physical Infrastructure and Transport to include the proposed bill in the Public Roads Act. Along with that, the government’s initiative to pass dedicated laws on road safety and set up a mechanism, including the empowered National Road Safety Council (NRSC), to decrease accidents, has come to a halt.Keshav Kumar Sharma, secretary of the Ministry of Physical Infrastructure and Transport, says they asked for a dedicated road safety law that comprehensively addresses institutional arrangements was the need of the hour. This includes ensuring safety in road construction, promoting public awareness, providing training and communication facilities, implementing rescue mechanisms, and arranging rehabilitation for families affected by road accidents. However, the Ministry of Finance believes a separate law is unnecessary due to concerns about potential increased financial burden.Hourly needOfficials from the Ministry of Physical Infrastructure allege that the Ministry of Finance is approaching sensitive matters, such as passenger safety, solely from an economic standpoint. They say that concerns related to road, vehicle, and passenger safety are being overshadowed, and there are indications that this approach will continue. “The government is avoiding addressing the sensitive issue of road accidents and the associated human and material costs, fearing an increase in expenses. This contradicts the government’s commitment and policy to reduce traffic accidents in the future,” says an official from the Ministry of Physical Infrastructure on the condition of anonymity.According to the Ministry of Physical Infrastructure, the existing laws lack the vision and purpose necessary for developing a sustainable, safe, risk-free, and reliable transportation operation and security system. Therefore, the Ministry of Physical Infrastructure officials argue that a distinct law is essential to decrease road accidents and ensure the safety of pedestrians, including passenger transport workers and roadside residents, as well as pets, wild animals, and birds. “The Road Safety Act is the need of the hour as it will help us during post-accident rescue, treatment management, rehabilitation, and legal representation,” says the official.Currently, there are gaps in enforcing road rules, monitoring vehicle capacities, ensuring road structure safety, managing traffic signs, and organizing road safety facilities. The implementation of the Road Safety Act is seen as crucial to address these issues.However, there has not been a facilitative environment for providing education and raising awareness about road traffic safety, safety mechanisms, and coordinating among organisations related to road transport. The aspect of training drivers with skills and knowledge, as well as monitoring road safety on the roads, is also lacking. This is why experts have been suggesting introducing a separate road safety law to address these aspects.The Finance Ministry, however, says that road safety should not be downplayed by ignoring human sensibilities related to road safety and citing economic reasons. Officials from the Ministry of Physical Infrastructure argue that incorporating safety considerations in the Road Act does not automatically result in a decrease in accidents or the integration of post-accident rescue, relief, and rehabilitation efforts.“The existing laws do not address road safety anywhere. Due to its lack of clarity and inadequacy, it has not been implemented with due diligence. For instance, provisions such as those for vehicle inspectors outlined in the Transport Act have not been acted upon by the government,” says an official from the Transport Ministry.Policies and commitments, but no lawsThe Motor Vehicles and Transport Management Act (1993) includes several provisions related to vehicle registration, road permits, driver’s licenses, traffic management, insurance, and penalties. The Public Roads Act (1974) primarily focuses on road management. However, there is no provision in the Act regarding the National Road Safety Council.In this situation, Nepal has developed a 10-year road safety action plan but is yet to enact corresponding legislation. Unfortunately, government agencies and mechanisms are not obligated to follow the action plan, as it lacks legal guidance.Now, the Transport Ministry holds the view that if safety considerations are explicitly addressed in the Public Roads Act, the outcome will not differ from what the Finance Ministry has said. Given the Public Roads Act’s close association with the Department of Road, the ministry thinks greater emphasis will be placed on road construction. However, they argue that incorporating the road safety aspect into the Act would not be effective.Secretary Sharma of the Transport Ministry is tasked with ensuring road safety, overseeing physical infrastructure and transport, and coordinating efforts across education, health, home, law, federal affairs, and general administration ministries. This responsibility extends to provincial ministries, local levels, as well as various agencies, organisations, security agencies, non-governmental organisations, and related entities, each with their specific roles.“As all the agencies need to be allocated responsibilities for various aspects of road safety, we have requested them to collaborate in formulating a distinct law. This should encompass the reduction of all types of accidents,” said Sharma.The ministry believes that a dedicated law addressing road safety is crucial to mitigate severe road accidents in Nepal and to uphold the commitments made by the country on the international stage.Nepal has committed to implementing the Stockholm Declaration through the Global Road Traffic Safety Conference in 2020, as per the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. Nepal, which has incorporated sustainable development goals into its national development plan, has not yet commenced work aligned with these objectives.Nevertheless, Nepal’s neighbouring countries are already addressing road safety through legal frameworks. Various states in India have enacted road safety laws, and the effectiveness of these laws is contributing to a 50 per cent reduction in road accidents.In 1999, Bhutan also introduced a unified road safety and transport act. Pakistan, on the other hand, issued the National Highway Safety Ordinance-2000 to ensure road safety, distinct from its National Highway Authority Act (1991). Britain, Australia, America, New Zealand, and other countries have established separate road safety laws as well.Road safety neglectedIn Nepal, road safety has been consistently neglected due to the absence of dedicated legislation. Road safety expert Keshav Adhikari says that the government primarily focused on road construction, overlooks crucial aspects such as road safety and reinforcement. Consequently, roads are transforming into perilous pathways for both vehicles and passengers.“There is a lack of interest in formulating policies and laws aimed at mitigating financial losses resulting from accidents,” says Adhikari.He further points out that safety is not a governmental priority, as expanding the road network is perceived to yield more political benefits than implementing additional structures to enhance road safety.“When I worked as an expert in the Transport Ministry for over a year, I realised that promoting road safety is not a government priority,” he says. “Annually, more people die due to road accidents than those who die in natural disasters, but the government has not given it much attention.”Even though the prime minister, ministers, and MPs keep asserting that roads have been constructed, no one seems to be addressing the critical issues of road safety and quality.Saroj Sitaula, General Secretary of the Federation of Nepalese National Transport Entrepreneurs (FNNTE), says that the government must be attentive as accidents are on the rise due to various technical and human factors, including road infrastructure. “Many accidents can be mitigated by improving road conditions, installing barriers on the sides, putting up informational boards, and ensuring scientific and practical road markings,” he says. “We need to formulate a plan and progress accordingly.”Sitaula argues that the government should establish policies to create mechanisms for emergency rescue, treatment, and rehabilitation after an accident occurs. He emphasises the importance of enhancing road infrastructure, conducting a scientific examination of the technical condition of vehicles, and ensuring compliance with the law by drivers, passengers, and regulators. He says that blaming drivers and transport entrepreneurs for accidents is inadequate, and the government must fulfil its responsibilities.Roads are unsafeNepal currently boasts a road network spanning approximately 100,000 km, with the majority consisting of dirt and gravel roads. Among the more than 22,000 kilometres of national and subsidiary highways, numerous sections remain unpaved.Despite the government’s substantial investment in road construction and expansion, minimal efforts are allocated to ensuring road safety. Recently, all three levels of government have accelerated the widening of roads, incorporating asphalt and slopes. However, it appears that issues concerning road quality and safety are escalating at a faster pace. Roads that have been neglected in the guise of maintenance have become a nightmare for the public.Infrastructure expert Suryaraj Acharya notes that these problems arise due to the tendency to

SAFF Championship: Inexperienced Nepal looking to upset debutants Kuwait,"Realme 12 Pro+ 5G. Photo: Realme IndiaRealme has launched its popular mid-range number series smartphone, the Realme 12 Pro series. The series includes the Realme 12 Pro 5G and the Realme 12 Pro+ 5G which are the successors of the Realme 11 Pro+ 5G and Realme 11 Pro 5G respectively. The Realme 11 series was widely appreciated for its design and performance at the price range. The 12 series has stepped up the game with an even better design. Realme has not only changed the design but has also upgraded the performance and the camera to compete in the mid-range price market. Realme recently has been focusing a lot on the design aspect and the price range performance. The 12 Pro+ has some major differences from last year’s 11 Pro+ which include design, IP rating, chipset, camera and charging. Let us see what the luxuriously designed smartphone delivers in terms of specs.Specifications of Realme 12 Pro+ 5GDimensionsLength: 161.47mmWidth: 74.02mmDepth: 8.75mmWeight196 gramsDisplay typeAMOLEDDisplay size6.7-inchResolution2,412 x 1,080 (FHD+)Refresh rateUp to 120HzIP ratingIP65 dust and water resistance Glass Protection0.55mm Double-Reinforced GlassChipsetSnapdragon 7s Gen 2 (4nm)CPUOcta-core (4×2.40 GHz Cortex-A78 & 4×1.95 GHz Cortex-A55)GPUAdreno 710OSRealme UI 5.0 based on Android 14RAM8GB | 12GBStorage128GB | 256GBRear camera 50MP Sony IMX890 main camera8MP ultra-wide camera64MP periscope portrait cameraSelfie camera32MP Wi-Fi802.11 a/b/g/n/ac/ax（Wi-Fi 6）Bluetooth5.2NetworkLTE | 5GSIMDual Nano SIMAudioDual SpeakersSupports Dolby AtmosDual-mic Noise CancellationHi-Res Audio CertificationSensorsGeomagnetic sensor, Proximity sensor, Light sensor, Acceleration sensor, Gyroscope, In-display fingerprint sensorBattery5,000mAh (typ)Charging67W SUPERVOOC wired fast chargingPorts and Buttons2 Nano SIM Card SlotsType-C PortPower ButtonVolume ButtonsColoursSubmarine BlueNavigator BeigeExplorer RedPrice (expected)Rs 50,000 (8/128GB)Rs 54,000 (8/256GB)Rs 60,000 (12/256GB)Design and DisplayThe Realme 12 Pro+ and the Realme 12 Pro share the same design and dimensions. The design is fascinating. Realme patterned up with Luxury Swiss Watch designer Ollivier Savéo to craftfully design the smartphone. All the colour options have a vegan leather back. Since the phone is designed by a luxury watch designer, it comes with a big round camera module housing the triple camera setup. There is a golden 3D Jubilee Bracelet which gives the texture of a luxury watch strap. A golden patterned line runs through the middle and around the camera module for an even better look.Realme 12 Pro+ 5G designer Ollivier Savéo. Photo: Realme IndiaThe back curves to the plastic frame which has a metal-like shiny finish. On the front, the 12 Pro+ 5G has a curved screen with a centred hole-punch cutout which houses the selfie camera. The bezels are minimal with the sides being curved almost zero while the top and the chin have a slight ear-like bezel.

Photo: Realme IndiaPerformance and StorageThe performance has also been stepped up with the change from MediaTek Chipset in the 11 Pro series to Snapdragon chipsets in the 12 Pro series. The Realme 12 Pro+ 5G is powered by the Snapdragon 7s Gen 2 chipset built on a 4nm processor. It has an octa-core CPU, which includes Cortex-A78 and Cortex-A55 cores for seamless multitasking and responsiveness. The Adreno 710 GPU handles the graphics for gaming and multimedia.

He has also won an Academy Award for Best Cinematography for his role in Life of Pi in 2013. Claudio Miranda has worked with Realme for fine-tuning images. There are also three film filters made in collaboration with Claudio Miranda with unique colour grading matched with a 2.39:1 aspect ratio and cinematic-level bokeh adjustment. The filters are Journey, Maverick and Memory. Photo: Realme IndiaThe Realme 12 Pro+ 5G has a triple camera setup at the rear.

ICC Cricket World Cup Qualifier: Nepal beat US by 6 wickets,"Ram Bujhaun Yadav with his land ownership certificate stands near a border pillar which he says was erroneously placed on his land. In October 2023, when 51-year-old Ram Bujhaun Yadav of Musaharnia Rural Municipality-5, Mukhiyapatti, Dhanusha, was at a relative’s house, someone told him that two Indian Sashastra Seema Bal (SSB) personnel were looking for him.Anxious, he rushed home wondering why they were looking for him.“They asked me if the paddy field in the no man’s land was mine. I told them yes and they asked me to cut down the paddy immediately,” he said.The paddy was not ripe and Yadav asked them for some time. However, the SSB personnel told him he had to cut down his paddy immediately.Ram Bujhaun and his wife Tetari Devi each own a 677-square-metre plot of land. As Nepal and India reevaluated the border, Ram Bujhan’s land was been deemed to be near the no man’s land as it now has two demarcation pillars.Frustrated, Ram Bujhaun cut the paddy before it was due to be harvested. Now, he has been asked to not plant anything on the land as it falls in the no man’s land.“Our border police don’t say a word. I can’t fight the SSB on my own,” says Ram Bujhaun adding he had decided not to plan anything on the land anymore.Woes of the farmersMany farmers in southern Nepal say their land has now been placed in India after the recent demarcation. When the Jamuna River, which flows through the no man’s land between Nepal and India, changed its course some two decades ago, some border pillars went missing. Locals say these pillars have now been placed encroaching on Nepali land.In 2018, with the then Chief District Officer of Dhanusha, Pradeep Raj Kandel, and an official from Madhubani district, Bihar, India, a team that included border security forces from both countries, the Armed Police Force of Nepal, and SSB of India began placing border pillars after land measurement by technicians.Locals have raised concerns, stating that border pillars have been positioned, encroaching approximately 50 to 100 meters of land into Nepal compared to the previous position. Many like Ram Bujhaun are unaware of when these border pillars were placed.“I did not know that pillar was placed here. After I found out when I asked the village leaders, many said they were placing the border pillars as they pleased,” said Ram Bujhaun.He was told to carry on planting paddy and that it would not matter as these issues had happened in the past. “They encroached on my land and have asked me not to plant anything. This is gross injustice,” he says.Ram Bujhaun’s family owns a total of 4,000 square metres of land, with 2,000 square metres belonging to him and the remaining 2,000 square metres to his brother Bechan. However, 1,000 square metres of his land is now located on the Indian side after the demarcation. Despite this, he has been farming on the land and continues to pay taxes to the Department of Land Management and Archive in Nepal.“They have marked my land to be on the Indian side and placed border pillars on it. I’ve been farming till now but I don’t know when they will ask me to stop,” he says.Ignorance of the governmentThe Madhesh province in southern NepalThe former ward chair of Mukhiyapatti Musharniya Rural Municipality-5, Ram Naresh Yadav, said that over time, India has encroached on numerous Nepali lands in various locations in the Madhesh Province. This, he says, happened due to the Nepali administration’s ignorance and weak stature.“They (Nepali administration) were careless and that meant the Indian side placed these border pillars by encroaching on Nepali land,” says Ram Naresh.He said that over 40 farmers from wards 1, 5, and 6 have land ranging from 300 to 1,600 square metres on the Indian side. “These farmers have land ownership certificates, but they cannot farm as the SSB says the land is in India and not Nepal,” said Ram Naresh.In 1996, land ownership certificates were distributed after surveying the land in the border area. Local Dharmendra Kumar Yadav said that since then, the locals have been paying their land tax regularly. In 2018, when the pillar was being placed, the locals protested when they saw their land was being encroached on. However, since the demarcation had been agreed upon by high-ranking government officials of Nepal and India, the farmer’s voices went unheard.“We tried to stop when the border pillars were being placed on our land. But the administrators from both sides forcibly put it there without even trying to hold a discussion,” said Harish Chandra Yadav. The Chief District Officer of Dhanusha, Chakrapani Pandey, says that the border pillars were placed by the technical team after the measurements and with the agreement of the high-ranking officials of the two countries.“The fields and houses that are built in no man’s land have recently been cleared. No one can do anything in this particular area,” said Pandey. “We understand the people’s concern but we cannot do anything about it now.”",['icc cricket world cup qualifi : nepal beat us 6 wicket'],"['ram bujhaun yadav land ownership certif stand near border pillar say erron place land .', 'octob 2023 , 51-year-old ram bujhaun yadav musaharnia rural municipality-5 , mukhiyapatti , dhanusha , rel ’ hous , someon told two indian sashastra seema bal ( ssb ) personnel look him.anxi , rush home wonder look him . “ ask paddi field man ’ land mine .', 'told ye ask cut paddi immedi , ” said.th paddi ripe yadav ask time .', 'howev , ssb personnel told cut paddi immediately.ram bujhaun wife tetari devi 677-square-metr plot land .', 'nepal india reevalu border , ram bujhan ’ land deem near man ’ land two demarc pillars.frustr , ram bujhaun cut paddi due harvest .', ', ask plant anyth land fall man ’ land . “ border polic ’ say word .', '’ fight ssb , ” say ram bujhaun ad decid plan anyth land anymore.wo farmersmani farmer southern nepal say land place india recent demarc .', 'jamuna river , flow man ’ land nepal india , chang cours two decad ago , border pillar went miss .', 'local say pillar place encroach nepali land.in 2018 , chief district offic dhanusha , pradeep raj kandel , offici madhubani district , bihar , india , team includ border secur forc countri , arm polic forc nepal , ssb india began place border pillar land measur technicians.loc rais concern , state border pillar posit , encroach approxim 50 100 meter land nepal compar previou posit .', 'mani like ram bujhaun unawar border pillar place . “ know pillar place .', 'found ask villag leader , mani said place border pillar pleas , ” said ram bujhaun.h told carri plant paddi would matter issu happen past .', '“ encroach land ask plant anyth .', 'gross injustic , ” says.ram bujhaun ’ famili own total 4,000 squar metr land , 2,000 squar metr belong remain 2,000 squar metr brother bechan .', 'howev , 1,000 squar metr land locat indian side demarc .', 'despit , farm land continu pay tax depart land manag archiv nepal . “ mark land indian side place border pillar .', '’ farm till ’ know ask stop , ” says.ignor governmentth madhesh provinc southern nepalth former ward chair mukhiyapatti musharniya rural municipality-5 , ram naresh yadav , said time , india encroach numer nepali land variou locat madhesh provinc .', ', say , happen due nepali administr ’ ignor weak statur . “ ( nepali administr ) careless meant indian side place border pillar encroach nepali land , ” say ram naresh.h said 40 farmer ward 1 , 5 , 6 land rang 300 1,600 squar metr indian side .', '“ farmer land ownership certif , farm ssb say land india nepal , ” said ram naresh.in 1996 , land ownership certif distribut survey land border area .', 'local dharmendra kumar yadav said sinc , local pay land tax regularli .', '2018 , pillar place , local protest saw land encroach .', 'howev , sinc demarc agre upon high-rank govern offici nepal india , farmer ’ voic went unheard . “ tri stop border pillar place land .', 'administr side forcibl put without even tri hold discuss , ” said harish chandra yadav .', 'chief district offic dhanusha , chakrapani pandey , say border pillar place technic team measur agreement high-rank offici two countri . “ field hous built man ’ land recent clear .', 'one anyth particular area , ” said pandey .', '“ understand peopl ’ concern anyth . ”']"
Posts navigation,"Photo by pippen on UnsplashLife is filled with surprises and unexpected events and it can change at any moment. The only thing certain in life is the uncertainty. Change is a natural and inevitable part of our lives, and it may be positive as well as negative.Even though it is not guaranteed that we will wake up in the morning, we set the alarm every night with the hope that we will wake up in the morning. We do not know what each day is going to bring us, but we may have varieties, adventures, and endless opportunities.The push to exploreThe uncertainty sometimes forces us to explore those aspects of life, we never knew existed or needed. It also tests the mental strength of people and how they deal with it. The uncertainty has taught me to be grateful, as we never know what life throws at us.In life, everything does not go according to our plans, and if we do not embrace the change we will face huge trouble. The Covid-19 pandemic is the best example of uncertainty, we were constantly fearing death and it was uncertain that we would see the sunrise the next day.It is not certain that every decision in life will be correct, but if you fear not trying at all, you miss endless opportunities for learning and growing. When our decisions or outcomes are on the negative side, we get depressed and we might tend to think about committing suicide, but we forget that if we have life we have endless opportunities. Most of us plan for our careers, our love life, etc. and when those plans do not work out we start getting uncomfortable. But if we can deal with today, we can surely deal with tomorrow. We need to cherish little moments in our lives and know that nothing is permanent not even the failures and setbacks.We come here with nothing and leave with nothing. So why should we hold the egos and grudges against each other? Instead of making our life meaningful and enjoying the journey of life, we get into puzzles of accumulating wealth and we go against our own loved ones for it. Change is certainPhoto by Kathyryn Tripp on UnsplashNothing is permanent in life, everything can change in fractions of seconds. In today’s society, everyone is so busy, that we people have so less time for our loved ones. What I have learned over the years, is to find time in our busy schedule for our family because we never know when it will be our last day together with them. Yes! Death is a natural process, so if you have to die someday, why should you die with grudges in your heart? But instead of worrying about the inevitable, focusing on the things you can control will bring a lot of happiness in life.Uncertainty is not only a negative thing; it also brings a lot of opportunity because you dare to change. The life-changing experience will not come knocking down your door, you need to expose yourself. We learn by doing and experimenting, even though we might fail. But that is not the end of the world. I still remember hesitating while applying for the role of leadership, at my school level as it was not certain that I would be chosen.Even after being selected, I was uncertain about whether I could fulfil my responsibilities or not. But that uncertainty helped me grow out of my comfort zone and give my best input. If I had not applied for that role just because I was uncertain of the outcome, I would miss the biggest learning opportunity in my school life. So, do not let the uncertainty or the unknown ever stop you from trying and no matter how much we try, to plan life always finds a way to surprise us. It is important to stay grounded when we have everything we wish for because life can take such a turn that we had never expected in our wildest dreams. Similarly, nothing is permanent in life, the financial hardships, the grades, the breakups, etc. But the most important thing is not to lose hope during those difficult times.According to the data provided by Nepal police, around 6,830 people took their lives in the fiscal year 2022/23. There is nothing in life that cannot be resolved although it may take time, committing suicide should not be an option. It’s important to share feelings among family members or loved ones because together as a family any problem can be overcome.Embrace the unknown and focus on enhancing your life, instead of worrying about what will happen next. Always find time for your loved ones, as life is uncertain. We should be grateful that we are alive and accept that change is the only constant thing in life. Do not let the unknown, stop you from trying or achieving your goals and always remember that even if you fail, you still have endless opportunities.",['post navig'],"['photo pippen unsplashlif fill surpris unexpect event chang moment .', 'thing certain life uncertainti .', 'chang natur inevit part live , may posit well negative.even though guarante wake morn , set alarm everi night hope wake morn .', 'know day go bring us , may varieti , adventur , endless opportunities.th push exploreth uncertainti sometim forc us explor aspect life , never knew exist need .', 'also test mental strength peopl deal .', 'uncertainti taught grate , never know life throw us.in life , everyth go accord plan , embrac chang face huge troubl .', 'covid-19 pandem best exampl uncertainti , constantli fear death uncertain would see sunris next day.it certain everi decis life correct , fear tri , miss endless opportun learn grow .', 'decis outcom neg side , get depress might tend think commit suicid , forget life endless opportun .', 'us plan career , love life , etc .', 'plan work start get uncomfort .', 'deal today , sure deal tomorrow .', 'need cherish littl moment live know noth perman even failur setbacks.w come noth leav noth .', 'hold ego grudg ?', 'instead make life meaning enjoy journey life , get puzzl accumul wealth go love one .', 'chang certainphoto kathyryn tripp unsplashnoth perman life , everyth chang fraction second .', 'today ’ societi , everyon busi , peopl less time love one .', 'learn year , find time busi schedul famili never know last day togeth .', 'ye !', 'death natur process , die someday , die grudg heart ?', 'instead worri inevit , focus thing control bring lot happi life.uncertainti neg thing ; also bring lot opportun dare chang .', 'life-chang experi come knock door , need expos .', 'learn experi , even though might fail .', 'end world .', 'still rememb hesit appli role leadership , school level certain would chosen.even select , uncertain whether could fulfil respons .', 'uncertainti help grow comfort zone give best input .', 'appli role uncertain outcom , would miss biggest learn opportun school life .', ', let uncertainti unknown ever stop tri matter much tri , plan life alway find way surpris us .', 'import stay ground everyth wish life take turn never expect wildest dream .', 'similarli , noth perman life , financi hardship , grade , breakup , etc .', 'import thing lose hope difficult times.accord data provid nepal polic , around 6,830 peopl took live fiscal year 2022/23 .', 'noth life resolv although may take time , commit suicid option .', '’ import share feel among famili member love one togeth famili problem overcome.embrac unknown focu enhanc life , instead worri happen next .', 'alway find time love one , life uncertain .', 'grate aliv accept chang constant thing life .', 'let unknown , stop tri achiev goal alway rememb even fail , still endless opportun .']"

Kushal Bhurtel took the game to Zimbabwean bowlers attacking every loose delivery. On the other end, Aasif Sheikh played a composed inning as the opening pair put up 171 runs for the first wicket.

Despite a 72-run stand between Kushal Malla and Rohit Paudel, who scored 41 and 31 respectively, the team kept losing wickets at regular intervals as Nepal only managed to score 291 in 50 overs.The score could have gone beyond 300 but Zimbabwe’s Richard Ngarava picked up four wickets to restrict Nepal to a par score.In reply, Zimbabwe did not get off to the best of starts losing opener Joylord Gumbie early. But a solid partnership between captain Craig Ervine and Wessly Madhevere steadied the innings for the hosts as they put up 82 runs. Madhevere held out to Dipendra Singh Airee as he tried to take on a short delivery from Gulshan Jha.But Ervine and Sean Williams carried the momentum forward putting up a 164-run stand and taking the hosts home with nearly six overs to spare. Ervine scored an impressive 128 ball 121 while Williams scored a blistering 102 of 70 balls.

Role of entrepreneurship education in Nepal’s quest for economic empowerment ,"Church Boys United lift the A Division League trophy at Dashrath Stadium on June 10, 2023. Photo: Chandra Bahadur AleA footballer, Tanka Lal Rai aka Reuben, always dreamt of playing in the A Division League. However, despite his relentless efforts, he was unable to fulfil this aspiration. Undeterred by this setback, Rai channelled his passion for the sport and establish Church Boys United in 2009 with the goal of playing in the A Division League.In 2010, when the team played the knockout tournament to get into the C Division for the first time, Rai captained the team himself. But he found out how tough the road was to get into the C Division and make their way to the top.It took Church Boys United nearly a decade to get into the C Division but when they did, the club made the most of it.In their debut season in the C Division in 2021, Church Boys United made an impressive mark by clinching the title. The following season, they continued their fine form and won the B Division in 2022.Many had felt the team would not be able to continue this trend, but defying the odds, the newly promoted side won the A Division League with one game to spare.With the unwavering commitment of its players and the relentless efforts of the team management, Church Boys United achieved a remarkable feat by becoming the second team, alongside Manang Marshyangdi Club, to win all three Divisions in their first attempts. This remarkable accomplishment showcases the team’s exceptional performance and solidifies their place in Nepali football history.“After 15 years of struggle, we have attained this dream. I can’t express this moment in words,” says Rai, president of Church Boys United. The three musketeersCaptain Ananta Tamang and striker Anjan Bista were integral to the team winning the league.When Church Boys United became champion of the B Division they did not have a single marquee player. Not wanting to disrupt the team had done so well, they kept hold of 12 players including their star player Ashish Chaudhary. But to take on heavyweights of Nepali football, the club brought in 16 players including Anjan Bista, Ananta Tamang, Tej Tamang, Dinesh Rajbanshi, Arik Bista and Kamal Shrestha. “I was confident about the squad. The team had the potential to win the league. So, I decided to join the team,” says club captain Ananta Tamang. Church Boys celebrating winning the B Division League to get promoted to the A Division.Prior to the commencement of the league, Church Boys United faced setbacks as key players Dinesh Rajbanshi and Tej Tamang departed for Australia. Bista also went to India to take part in the I Leauge. The absence of these players hindered the team during the initial matches. Simultaneously, the team faced another setback as Nepali American coach Pradip Humagain stepped down from his position due to challenges in acquiring a work permit.Bista joined the team on Matchday 6 while on Matchday 7, the team played without a coach. Bal Gopal Maharjan joined the team on Matchday 8 and did not have the best of starts winning one, drawing two and losing two.The team experienced a turning point on Matchday 13 when they faced Manang Marsyangdi Club. In a resounding victory, they defeated MMC 3-0, which significantly boosted their confidence.“It gave us the belief that we could take on anyone,” said Bista.Church Boys United showed great unity to win the A Division League in their debut season.Since then one, the team did not look back winning eight of the 13 matches to become champions of Nepal.Maharjan feels this title was a result of hard work and feels extremely proud of having won it with Bista and Tamang who he has coached since they were teenagers.During the post-match conference, he sat between them and proudly acknowledged the entire team for their victory, singling out specific individuals for their exceptional contributions.The club’s President, Rai, attributes the team’s victory to strong leadership and acknowledges the significant roles played by players like Bista and Tamang in achieving success.“The leadership quality in the field made our team successful,” says Rai, pointing to Tamang, “Furthermore, we were also very strict about discipline. We were successful in maintaining the team’s unity. Foreign players also played well, according to their capacity.” Bista expressed his gratitude towards his teammates, team management, and coach, emphasising the strong bond they shared as a family. “Our unity played a crucial role in securing the victory,” he says.Lost opportunity Team celebrate winning the A Division League title. Winning the A Division is not only a matter of becoming a national champion but also presents clubs with an exciting opportunity to participate in an international tournament.The league champion earns the privilege of representing Nepal in the AFC Cup, a prestigious tournament organised by the Asian Football Confederation that brings together league champions from across Asia.But Church Boys United will not be able to take part in the count competition as they do not have an AFC licence. In Nepal, only Machhindra Football Club, Tribhuvan Army Club and Armed Police Force have the AFC licence. As Church Boys United do not have the licence, Machhindra, who finished second in the league, will play in the AFC Cup. The players of Church Boys United express their disappointment regarding the missed opportunity to participate in the AFC Cup.“We have lost the opportunity to introduce the Church Boys United to the international stage,” says Tamang.Bista was informed about this during the league, which came as a surprise to him. “We put in a lot of effort, but some other team will get to take part in the tournament that we should have been able to take part in,” he said.However, the club’s President, Rai, remains optimistic and states that the club will work towards obtaining the AFC licence so this does not happen again.This story was translated from the original Nepali version and edited for clarity and length.",['role entrepreneurship educ nepal ’ quest econom empower'],"['church boy unit lift divis leagu trophi dashrath stadium june 10 , 2023 .', 'photo : chandra bahadur alea footbal , tanka lal rai aka reuben , alway dreamt play divis leagu .', 'howev , despit relentless effort , unabl fulfil aspir .', 'undet setback , rai channel passion sport establish church boy unit 2009 goal play divis league.in 2010 , team play knockout tournament get c divis first time , rai captain team .', 'found tough road get c divis make way top.it took church boy unit nearli decad get c divis , club made it.in debut season c divis 2021 , church boy unit made impress mark clinch titl .', 'follow season , continu fine form b divis 2022.mani felt team would abl continu trend , defi odd , newli promot side divis leagu one game spare.with unwav commit player relentless effort team manag , church boy unit achiev remark feat becom second team , alongsid manang marshyangdi club , win three divis first attempt .', 'remark accomplish showcas team ’ except perform solidifi place nepali footbal histori . “ 15 year struggl , attain dream .', '’ express moment word , ” say rai , presid church boy unit .', 'three musketeerscaptain ananta tamang striker anjan bista integr team win league.when church boy unit becam champion b divis singl marque player .', 'want disrupt team done well , kept hold 12 player includ star player ashish chaudhari .', 'take heavyweight nepali footbal , club brought 16 player includ anjan bista , ananta tamang , tej tamang , dinesh rajbanshi , arik bista kamal shrestha .', '“ confid squad .', 'team potenti win leagu .', ', decid join team , ” say club captain ananta tamang .', 'church boy celebr win b divis leagu get promot division.prior commenc leagu , church boy unit face setback key player dinesh rajbanshi tej tamang depart australia .', 'bista also went india take part leaug .', 'absenc player hinder team initi match .', 'simultan , team face anoth setback nepali american coach pradip humagain step posit due challeng acquir work permit.bista join team matchday 6 matchday 7 , team play without coach .', 'bal gopal maharjan join team matchday 8 best start win one , draw two lose two.th team experienc turn point matchday 13 face manang marsyangdi club .', 'resound victori , defeat mmc 3-0 , significantli boost confid . “ gave us belief could take anyon , ” said bista.church boy unit show great uniti win divis leagu debut season.sinc one , team look back win eight 13 match becom champion nepal.maharjan feel titl result hard work feel extrem proud bista tamang coach sinc teenagers.dur post-match confer , sat proudli acknowledg entir team victori , singl specif individu except contributions.th club ’ presid , rai , attribut team ’ victori strong leadership acknowledg signific role play player like bista tamang achiev success . “ leadership qualiti field made team success , ” say rai , point tamang , “ furthermor , also strict disciplin .', 'success maintain team ’ uniti .', 'foreign player also play well , accord capac . ” bista express gratitud toward teammat , team manag , coach , emphasis strong bond share famili .', '“ uniti play crucial role secur victori , ” says.lost opportun team celebr win divis leagu titl .', 'win divis matter becom nation champion also present club excit opportun particip intern tournament.th leagu champion earn privileg repres nepal afc cup , prestigi tournament organis asian footbal confeder bring togeth leagu champion across asia.but church boy unit abl take part count competit afc licenc .', 'nepal , machhindra footbal club , tribhuvan armi club arm polic forc afc licenc .', 'church boy unit licenc , machhindra , finish second leagu , play afc cup .', 'player church boy unit express disappoint regard miss opportun particip afc cup . “ lost opportun introduc church boy unit intern stage , ” say tamang.bista inform leagu , came surpris .', '“ put lot effort , team get take part tournament abl take part , ” said.howev , club ’ presid , rai , remain optimist state club work toward obtain afc licenc happen again.thi stori translat origin nepali version edit clariti length .']"

But when the two sprinted ahead of the pack, no one could tell if this was the first time the two were running a high-altitude marathon in their career.Leaving Jumla, Manju Rawot and Dal Bahadur Kunwar just wanted to have fun and compete in the famous race. But Kunwar finished second in the male category finishing the race in under four hours while Rawot finish first in the female category finishing the race in 5 hours and 25 minutes shocking everyone, even themselves.So how did the two manage to perform so impressively in the marathon? The answer lies in their training, hard work and determination.Strong rootsDal Bahadur Kunwar Photo: Chandra Bahadur Ale Manju Rawot and Dal Bahadur Kunwar are products of Karanali Sports Club, established by Hari Bahadur Rokaya, one of Nepal’s best marathon runners. This club has a notable track record of nurturing talented athletes like Sunmaya Budha, who has been participating in numerous races internationally and consistently securing podium finishes.Here the two learnt pace, timing, diet and endurance. In addition, both of them acquired additional running skills, which developed their ability to compete against the country’s top athletes.The guidance and training provided by their mentor Rokaya in the remote high-altitude regions of Karnali province gave them an advantage, which was evident during the Everest marathon.Despite struggling with altitude sickness and fatigue, they two showed everyone what a positive mindset can do when it comes to running in the Himalayas.“The training there is rigorous and we can’t thank the club enough,” says Kunwar.At the club, they engage in two types of training sessions, six days a week from Monday to Saturday. One focuses on pacing while the other focuses on distance covering. During the pacing sessions, they would run 20 kilometres on the track, while the distance-covering sessions involved running on trails in the hills and forests.“We run five hours every Saturday and get Sundays off,” says Rawot.Born to runManju Rawot Photo: Chandra Bahadur Ale Manju Rawot and Dal Bahadur Kunwar career trajectory, however, has been different. Rawot, 21, started running as early as 13, while Kunwar only started running a year ago.Rawot caught people’s eyes after creating a national record in the President’s Running Sheild. Soon she was training under Rokaya. She trained with the club until she was in school after which she stopped to get a job and take care of her family.“It is hard as a girl. Society talks a lot when we do what we love. They said that as a girl, I had to follow the norms of the society. I did not want my family to be disrespected so I started to look for jobs to help my family,” says Rawot.But she knew she was made for running and after a hiatus of a few years, Rawot made a comeback last year at the Jumla Rara Ultra Marathon.“Running is in my blood. Winning the ultra marathon made me believe in my ability once again,” she says.Like Rawot, Kunwar, 22, was also born to run. Despite starting his running career just a year ago, Kunwar has already participated in and won several marathons. He achieved podium finishes in races like Jumla-Rara Ultra Marathon, Guerrilla Ultra Trail Race, Pokhara Fishtail Marathon, and many more.Kunwar wanted to join the Nepal Army and even attempted the trials two years ago. While he successfully cleared all the physical tests with ease, unfortunately, he did not pass the written exam.Disappointed in not being able to get into the Nepal Army, he also ran the Jumla Trail Marathon in July 2022 finishing second. That for him became a turning point as he has not looked back since.“I ran for fun and came in second. I then wanted to test myself and joined the Karnali Sports Club,” says Kunwar.Started from the bottom, aiming for the starsDespite facing numerous challenges, the Manju Rawot and Dal Bahadur Kunwar from Karnali have achieved remarkable success, bringing pride to both Karnali province and their club, Karnali Sports Club. Their accomplishments stand as evidence that individuals can excel in sports and become leaders, even when hailing from underdeveloped regions with limited infrastructure and practice opportunities.Rawot expresses gratitude to her family, acknowledging that without their support, she would not have reached this point in her athletic journey.“They told me to do what I love. I am thankful to them,” she says.Kunwar too feels that family support is integral to their success along with the role of the Karnali Sports Club. “This is a team effort,” he says.Now Manju Rawot and Dal Bahadur Kunwar want to take a leap out of Sunmaya’s book and compete in races abroad. They feel they are ready and given how they have been able to do so with limited exposure and resources, the two feel if they get the right kind of support, they can participate and even win these races.“Our goal is the UTMB. If we continue to work hard, I believe we can do it and maybe one day win a major race and make Nepal proud,” says Rawot.",['erron border pillar placement plagu nepali farmer madhesh'],"['l-r : dal bahadur kunwar manju rawot photo : chandra bahadur ale may 29 , manju rawot dal bahadur kunwar , particip tenz hillari everest marathon , one toughest marathon world , first time .', 'two sprint ahead pack , one could tell first time two run high-altitud marathon career.leav jumla , manju rawot dal bahadur kunwar want fun compet famou race .', 'kunwar finish second male categori finish race four hour rawot finish first femal categori finish race 5 hour 25 minut shock everyon , even themselves.so two manag perform impress marathon ?', 'answer lie train , hard work determination.strong rootsdal bahadur kunwar photo : chandra bahadur ale manju rawot dal bahadur kunwar product karanali sport club , establish hari bahadur rokaya , one nepal ’ best marathon runner .', 'club notabl track record nurtur talent athlet like sunmaya budha , particip numer race intern consist secur podium finishes.her two learnt pace , time , diet endur .', 'addit , acquir addit run skill , develop abil compet countri ’ top athletes.th guidanc train provid mentor rokaya remot high-altitud region karnali provinc gave advantag , evid everest marathon.despit struggl altitud sick fatigu , two show everyon posit mindset come run himalaya . “ train rigor ’ thank club enough , ” say kunwar.at club , engag two type train session , six day week monday saturday .', 'one focus pace focus distanc cover .', 'pace session , would run 20 kilometr track , distance-cov session involv run trail hill forest . “ run five hour everi saturday get sunday , ” say rawot.born runmanju rawot photo : chandra bahadur ale manju rawot dal bahadur kunwar career trajectori , howev , differ .', 'rawot , 21 , start run earli 13 , kunwar start run year ago.rawot caught peopl ’ eye creat nation record presid ’ run sheild .', 'soon train rokaya .', 'train club school stop get job take care famili . “ hard girl .', 'societi talk lot love .', 'said girl , follow norm societi .', 'want famili disrespect start look job help famili , ” say rawot.but knew made run hiatu year , rawot made comeback last year jumla rara ultra marathon . “ run blood .', 'win ultra marathon made believ abil , ” says.lik rawot , kunwar , 22 , also born run .', 'despit start run career year ago , kunwar alreadi particip sever marathon .', 'achiev podium finish race like jumla-rara ultra marathon , guerrilla ultra trail race , pokhara fishtail marathon , mani more.kunwar want join nepal armi even attempt trial two year ago .', 'success clear physic test eas , unfortun , pass written exam.disappoint abl get nepal armi , also ran jumla trail marathon juli 2022 finish second .', 'becam turn point look back sinc . “ ran fun came second .', 'want test join karnali sport club , ” say kunwar.start bottom , aim starsdespit face numer challeng , manju rawot dal bahadur kunwar karnali achiev remark success , bring pride karnali provinc club , karnali sport club .', 'accomplish stand evid individu excel sport becom leader , even hail underdevelop region limit infrastructur practic opportunities.rawot express gratitud famili , acknowledg without support , would reach point athlet journey . “ told love .', 'thank , ” says.kunwar feel famili support integr success along role karnali sport club .', '“ team effort , ” says.now manju rawot dal bahadur kunwar want take leap sunmaya ’ book compet race abroad .', 'feel readi given abl limit exposur resourc , two feel get right kind support , particip even win race . “ goal utmb .', 'continu work hard , believ mayb one day win major race make nepal proud , ” say rawot .']"
"Regenerative Braking in EVs: Advantages, Disadvantages and Common Misconceptions ","Salina Shrestha has dedicated 14 years of her life to playing volleyball. Photo: Chandra Bahadur AleSalina Shrestha, the volleyball player, always stands out when she steps onto the court. As a libero, she wears a distinct jersey and standing at just 4 feet 9 inches tall, she is noticeably shorter than most of her fellow players which sets her apart from others on the team. Despite the generally perceived benefits of height in volleyball, Salina Shrestha has proven that it does not hinder her performance. She has been involved with the national volleyball team for five years and in that time has won two titles, showcasing what hard work and resilience can do for a player.She was key to Nepal winning the silver medal at the 13th South Asian Games. Her performance during the recently concluded CAVA Women’s Challenge Cup Volleyball was of note too as she was dubbed the best libero showing how far she’s come in her career.Now, Salina Shrestha wants to continue to improve in her craft as she hopes to end her career with a few more international titles to her name.Trailblazing journeyDespite the generally perceived benefits of height in volleyball, Salina Shrestha has proven that it does not hinder her performance. Photo: Bikash ShresthaThis was not the first time she has been awarded the best libero as she won it during the CAVA Senior Women’s Central Zone Volleyball Competition in 2021. While her earlier achievement showcased her talent, this particular award on home soil added a deeper level of significance for her.“I feel proud. There were some great women and being called the best of all of them is a great feeling,” she says.Not winning the title, however, has left a bad taste for her as there were high expectations going into the tournament given Nepal were defending champions. This year’s competition proved to be challenging, primarily due to the presence of two formidable teams—India and Kazakhstan. The strong presence of these teams added to the intensity of the competition, making it a tough battle for Nepal to defend their title.“We gave it our best. It does not feel good to lose but we are proud of ourselves,” she says.Small in stature, mighty in spiritSince joining the national team four years ago, Salina Shrestha has established herself as a prominent libero in Nepali women’s volleyball. Photo: Chandra Bahadur AleThe tournament was tough for Nepal but the team showed significant improvements primarily in defence which had been the team’s Achilles heel. “We can still improve our defence and get better at blocking and even serving,” she says pointing out areas where the team can focus on to become even more formidable in these aspects of the game.One thing the team lacked during this tournament was practice. The team had a new coach in Belgian Jan De Brandt. But in the three months that he was with the team, they did not play a single practice match before the tournament.Despite that, Nepal easily defeated Kyrgyzstan and Bangladesh in their first two games but lost to rivals India in the final group game which showed where the team really stood.“We played a good game against India but lost key points. The coach made us believe in ourselves and that showed in the game against India. We cannot wait for the Asian Games,” she said.Salina Shrestha has dedicated 14 years of her life to playing volleyball. Her contribution in establishing New Diamond Club as a dominant force in Nepali women’s volleyball has been instrumental. Her skills and leadership played a significant role in the club’s success and rise to prominence in the sport.Her leadership took the team to a new height as it soon became one of the most liked teams in Nepal. They were so good, they even gave departmental teams like Nepal Police and Nepal Army a run for their money.Her journey into the national team, however, was not as straightforward.Long road to successDespite consistently performing well in domestic volleyball, Salina Shrestha had to wait a lot to represent the national team. Photo: Chandra Bahadur AleDespite consistently performing well in domestic volleyball, Salina Shrestha had to wait a lot to represent the national team. The disappointment of not being able to secure a spot on the team weighed heavily on her, especially after being called to training camps for the selection of the South Asian Games in 2016 and the World Championship the following year. The emotional impact of these experiences affected Shrestha deeply as she wanted to test herself at the highest level.From 2013 to 2016, Shrestha’s defensive skills consistently left everyone in awe. Whether it was her remarkable technique, agility, or unwavering determination, her defence was all people in volleyball talked about.“Salina was like a robot,” says Kumar Rai, coach of New Diamond Club.After experiencing disappointment from being left out of the national team, she finally got a deserved call-up in 2019. The team was quite balanced too and Shrestha feels lucky to be a part of the team that won an international title and came in second in the South Asian Games.The national women’s volleyball team underwent several changes in 2019 for the CAVA Central Zone Senior Women’s Volleyball Competition. The tournament provided an opportunity for many young players to showcase their talents and represent the team including Shrestha. And she did not disappoint as she stood out as the sole libero during the Central Zone Volleyball Competition held in Bangladesh in 2019. “I was nervous at first but later after entering court everything felt right,” she says.After a four-year wait, Salina Shrestha finally had the chance to prove herself on the international stage. That also coincided with Nepal winning their first international competition which also earned her a permanent place in the team. Since joining the national team four years ago, Salina Shrestha has established herself as a prominent libero in Nepali women’s volleyball. Throughout this time, she has not been challenged. Shrestha’s abilities and consistent performances have solidified her status as a standout player in her position, making her an unrivalled presence in Nepali women’s volleyball when it comes to the libero role.This story was translated from the original Nepali version and edited for clarity and length.","['regen brake ev : advantag , disadvantag common misconcept']","['salina shrestha dedic 14 year life play volleybal .', 'photo : chandra bahadur alesalina shrestha , volleybal player , alway stand step onto court .', 'libero , wear distinct jersey stand 4 feet 9 inch tall , notic shorter fellow player set apart other team .', 'despit gener perceiv benefit height volleybal , salina shrestha proven hinder perform .', 'involv nation volleybal team five year time two titl , showcas hard work resili player.sh key nepal win silver medal 13th south asian game .', 'perform recent conclud cava women ’ challeng cup volleybal note dub best libero show far ’ come career.now , salina shrestha want continu improv craft hope end career intern titl name.trailblaz journeydespit gener perceiv benefit height volleybal , salina shrestha proven hinder perform .', 'photo : bikash shresthathi first time award best libero cava senior women ’ central zone volleybal competit 2021 .', 'earlier achiev showcas talent , particular award home soil ad deeper level signific her . “ feel proud .', 'great women call best great feel , ” says.not win titl , howev , left bad tast high expect go tournament given nepal defend champion .', 'year ’ competit prove challeng , primarili due presenc two formid teams—india kazakhstan .', 'strong presenc team ad intens competit , make tough battl nepal defend titl . “ gave best .', 'feel good lose proud , ” says.smal statur , mighti spiritsinc join nation team four year ago , salina shrestha establish promin libero nepali women ’ volleybal .', 'photo : chandra bahadur aleth tournament tough nepal team show signific improv primarili defenc team ’ achil heel .', '“ still improv defenc get better block even serv , ” say point area team focu becom even formid aspect game.on thing team lack tournament practic .', 'team new coach belgian jan de brandt .', 'three month team , play singl practic match tournament.despit , nepal easili defeat kyrgyzstan bangladesh first two game lost rival india final group game show team realli stood . “ play good game india lost key point .', 'coach made us believ show game india .', 'wait asian game , ” said.salina shrestha dedic 14 year life play volleybal .', 'contribut establish new diamond club domin forc nepali women ’ volleybal instrument .', 'skill leadership play signific role club ’ success rise promin sport.her leadership took team new height soon becam one like team nepal .', 'good , even gave department team like nepal polic nepal armi run money.h journey nation team , howev , straightforward.long road successdespit consist perform well domest volleybal , salina shrestha wait lot repres nation team .', 'photo : chandra bahadur aledespit consist perform well domest volleybal , salina shrestha wait lot repres nation team .', 'disappoint abl secur spot team weigh heavili , especi call train camp select south asian game 2016 world championship follow year .', 'emot impact experi affect shrestha deepli want test highest level.from 2013 2016 , shrestha ’ defens skill consist left everyon awe .', 'whether remark techniqu , agil , unwav determin , defenc peopl volleybal talk about . “ salina like robot , ” say kumar rai , coach new diamond club.aft experienc disappoint left nation team , final got deserv call-up 2019 .', 'team quit balanc shrestha feel lucki part team intern titl came second south asian games.th nation women ’ volleybal team underw sever chang 2019 cava central zone senior women ’ volleybal competit .', 'tournament provid opportun mani young player showcas talent repres team includ shrestha .', 'disappoint stood sole libero central zone volleybal competit held bangladesh 2019 .', '“ nervou first later enter court everyth felt right , ” says.aft four-year wait , salina shrestha final chanc prove intern stage .', 'also coincid nepal win first intern competit also earn perman place team .', 'sinc join nation team four year ago , salina shrestha establish promin libero nepali women ’ volleybal .', 'throughout time , challeng .', 'shrestha ’ abil consist perform solidifi statu standout player posit , make unrival presenc nepali women ’ volleybal come libero role.thi stori translat origin nepali version edit clariti length .']"

Queer art festival: Reflecting and imagining the power of collaboration in Nepal ,"Despite winning the Prime Minister’s Three Nations Cup, Nepal are not seen as a contender for the SAFF Championship.Nepal’s national football team has left for the Philippines to play a friendly match before heading to Banglore, India to take part in the SAFF Championship.In previous years, the team has always approached the tournament aiming to win it. However, this year things are different.Despite being the former runner-up, the football team has no goal. With a team seeing a sea of change, it is almost certain the team will have a hard time during the tournament. The inability to establish themselves as a strong contender in the South Asian region can be attributed to three primary reasons.Players leaving the countryNepal footballers Dinesh Rajbanshi and Tej Tamang before they fly to Australia in January 2023. In the past year, a large number of players have migrated abroad. While the All Nepal Football Association (ANFA) does not have official data, it is estimated that around 80 to 90 national team players have left the country for a better future abroad.This affected the recently concluded A Division League but its greater impact is on the national football team as it disrupted the balance within the team which was reflected in their performance during the Prime Minister Three Nations Cup held in Kathmandu in April.Nepal needing a last-minute goal to draw with Bhutan was a testament to how far off the team has come since the last SAFF Championship when it reached the final for the very first time.Captain Kiran Chemjong got emotional when ask about the increasing exodus of players during the farewell program held for the team on June 11. He expressed his sadness over how players felt compelled to leave the country as they saw no future in football.“Players leaving in the middle of the league season is disheartening to see. When I hear news of friends I’ve played with for so long leaving, it pains me. I often ask what the future holds for me,” he said.He says it was about time the government and relevant sporting bodies did something to address this issue.“If not, more will go and what happens to the national team then,” he said.Poor preparationsFile photoThe SAFF Championship starts on June 21. But the team only started preparing for the biggest football tournament in South Asia on June 11. Prior to the tournament, the team will play one friendly match against the Philippines before taking on India, Kuwait and Pakistan in the group games.Due to the delayed conclusion of the league on June 10, the head coach Vincenzo Alberto Annese faced challenges in organising a training camp for the national team for the SAFF Championship. The lack of planning from ANFA and the reluctance of A Division Clubs to release players further hindered his efforts to execute his plans effectively.Teams usually need a month of training before taking part in a major tournament. However, Nepal’s team will have gotten together a week before the tournament with only one friendly match under their belt. In addition, with the team relatively new, Chemjong understands it will be challenging.“It is going to be hard. We have had no time to understand each other’s game so I cannot say what will happen in the SAFF Championship,” he said.Tough competitionIn a bid to improve the quality of the SAFF Championship, the federation invited two teams from the Gulf region Lebanon and Kuwait. While this move is expected to elevate the overall level of competition, it has also pushed Nepal’s title aspirations further away, considering their inadequate preparation for the tournament.The South Asian teams will face tough opponents in Lebanon, ranked 99th in the FIFA rankings, and Kuwait, ranked 143rd. Considering that Nepal have not beaten India since 2013, the team beating Kuwait and a changed Pakistan in the group stage is highly unlikely.“The tournament as a whole is going to be great thanks to Lebanon and Kuwait. We have not had the best of preparations but we will give our all,” said Chemjong.This story was translated from the original Nepali version and edited for clarity and length.",['queer art festiv : reflect imagin power collabor nepal'],"['despit win prime minist ’ three nation cup , nepal seen contend saff championship.nep ’ nation footbal team left philippin play friendli match head banglor , india take part saff championship.in previou year , team alway approach tournament aim win .', 'howev , year thing different.despit former runner-up , footbal team goal .', 'team see sea chang , almost certain team hard time tournament .', 'inabl establish strong contend south asian region attribut three primari reasons.play leav countrynep footbal dinesh rajbanshi tej tamang fli australia januari 2023 .', 'past year , larg number player migrat abroad .', 'nepal footbal associ ( anfa ) offici data , estim around 80 90 nation team player left countri better futur abroad.thi affect recent conclud divis leagu greater impact nation footbal team disrupt balanc within team reflect perform prime minist three nation cup held kathmandu april.nep need last-minut goal draw bhutan testament far team come sinc last saff championship reach final first time.captain kiran chemjong got emot ask increas exodu player farewel program held team june 11 .', 'express sad player felt compel leav countri saw futur footbal . “ player leav middl leagu season dishearten see .', 'hear news friend ’ play long leav , pain .', 'often ask futur hold , ” said.h say time govern relev sport bodi someth address issu . “ , go happen nation team , ” said.poor preparationsfil phototh saff championship start june 21 .', 'team start prepar biggest footbal tournament south asia june 11 .', 'prior tournament , team play one friendli match philippin take india , kuwait pakistan group games.du delay conclus leagu june 10 , head coach vincenzo alberto annes face challeng organis train camp nation team saff championship .', 'lack plan anfa reluct divis club releas player hinder effort execut plan effectively.team usual need month train take part major tournament .', 'howev , nepal ’ team gotten togeth week tournament one friendli match belt .', 'addit , team rel new , chemjong understand challeng . “ go hard .', 'time understand ’ game say happen saff championship , ” said.tough competitionin bid improv qualiti saff championship , feder invit two team gulf region lebanon kuwait .', 'move expect elev overal level competit , also push nepal ’ titl aspir away , consid inadequ prepar tournament.th south asian team face tough oppon lebanon , rank 99th fifa rank , kuwait , rank 143rd .', 'consid nepal beaten india sinc 2013 , team beat kuwait chang pakistan group stage highli unlik . “ tournament whole go great thank lebanon kuwait .', 'best prepar give , ” said chemjong.thi stori translat origin nepali version edit clariti length .']"

ICC Men’s World Cup Qualifier to be streamed on Net TV,"As untouched and less discussed as the sports management industry is in Nepal, it has ample room to showcase creativity. Photo by Miguel Bruna on UnsplashIn 2023, Barbie named Women in Sports as their career of the year.Whenever I am out and about socially, there is always someone who seems pretty certain about not considering my profession as mainstream. Hold up! Sports as a career? In Nepal? You bet! This article aims to explain why women in this male-dominant sports industry in Nepal should not be viewed as a surprise.I have been part of the Nepali cricket industry in a private capacity for quite a while now. Armed with a Master’s Degree in IT from an American University, my choice to stick with sports management tends to raise eyebrows. While I am not an on-field player, I am definitely behind the scenes, playing strong games of serious deliverance with my team. We are all about creating what is not there.As untouched and less discussed as the sports management industry is in Nepal, it has ample room to showcase creativity. Being a commanding woman in a position can be challenging, but on the brighter side, the gender advantage has yet to fail me. As alien as I might be in sports management in Nepal, I have been accepted with open arms. The nature of the job is highly competitive, no doubt.Embraced by the sports fraternityPhoto: PixabayWomen in sports are safe, heard, and welcomed. I absolutely relish the addition of spirited women to the team. The nuances of sports are something women complement greatly. Sports management inherently rejects narrow minds. There is a lot of travelling, meeting people, experimenting, and remembering limitations. The adjustments are both trivial and clever. Often, in our part of the world, societal norms limit women from making career decisions, hindering them from living life on their terms. This restriction potentially keeps many capable women from pursuing the sports industry, where they could truly wield their power to make an impact. Change is gradual, and I hope to see numerous female faces in charge of stadiums someday in Nepal.Yes, there are challenges. It ranges from personal sacrifices to job security and opportunities. However, these are workable factors for any freelancer in sports management. The key is excelling at our jobs to thrive anywhere. Taking a page from the medical field, the seriousness we apply there should not differ in sports management. Sports is a powerful industry. Children grow up idolising what we showcase on TV. As glorious as the game is, it is every child’s dream to represent their country someday. Carrying that responsibility is our role in sports—an often thankless yet deeply satisfying job.Nepali sports industryThe fans went wild at TU Cricket Ground after Nepal beat UAE.Sports may be a smaller industry in Nepal, but globally, it is a behemoth. The world economy has shifted, and it is time we alter our perspective to recognise the potential of sports as an industry in Nepal. The idea of open commercialisation of sports remains somewhat unexplored, as it continues to be a more exclusive affair in Nepal. By sourcing innovative ideas, there’s a wealth of public attention and investment waiting to be tapped into, along with numerous practices to establish and discard. As the Nepali team achieves international records, the packaging of the sport becomes everything. There is plenty to learn from international sports management to make our industry highly marketable and poised for global entry.Sports such as cricket, football, volleyball, or even golf serve as key intersections for reshaping Nepal’s global narrative. Over the years, Kabaddi has witnessed a substantial surge in India, both in terms of viewership and commercial success. The primary challenge we grapple with is Nepal’s comparatively small market size, posing constraints on our ability to generate substantial economic gains. Therefore, there is unanimous agreement on the imperative for Nepal’s sports to venture onto the international stage.Nepal boasts many hardworking individuals, yet achieving this goal demands specialised talents in sports management with the requisite experience and the capacity to enhance existing values. In the long run, outsourcing such talents may foster dependence. Hence, a concerted effort is needed to inspire Nepali youth to engage in sports management, contributing to our sports ecosystem. There are various ways in which we can harness the potential of sports for our benefit. Encouraging youth involvement can be instrumental in capitalising on the multifaceted opportunities presented by the sports industry.

2 ultra runners from Karnali dream of UTMB   ,"Painting ‘My Private Life’ by artist Priyam Pradhan at the exhibition Mani at Siddhartha Art Gallery, Baber Mahal. Photo: Chandra Bahadur AleUsing Pitt’s artist pen on paper, artist Priyam Pradhan presents My Private Life, a showcase of the current significance of his life depicted in abstract form.At the centre of the painting is a 1000-rupee note, within which Pradhan has intricately painted Lord Krishna, a man wearing a hoodie tenderly embracing his dog, and a woman. The woman stands tall, elongated in form. Towards the bottom of the canvas, a holy man reaches out his hands, appearing to be in flight.Priyam Pradhan has used a vibrant colour palette, incorporating bright hues such as pink, orange, and yellow, as well as green, black, white, and grey. This combination adds a dynamic and lively quality to the artwork.“The man in the centre is me and the girl in green is my girlfriend. And the faces are my mom and dad,” says Pradhan. “The sadhu (holy man) symbolises my desires that I don’t have many desires for materialistic things however I do understand the value of money.”The use of colours, figures and lines in an abstract form in his painting resembles the painting of American painter Paul Jackson Pollock. Like his abstract expressionism, Pradhan has expressed himself in his painting.Furthermore, this marks Priyam Pradhan’s third solo painting exhibition titled Mani (money), inaugurated on January 17 at Siddhartha Art Gallery, Baber Mahal.In his previous exhibitions, Pradhan’s artworks centred around Hindu philosophy and his spontaneous thought process. However, in this latest exhibition, he explores the theme of money and its impact on an individual’s life, delving into the reverberating effects of financial aspects.Understanding the value of moneyPaintings by artist Priyam Pradhan at Siddhartha Art Gallery, Baber Mahal. Photo: Chandra Bahadur AleAny form of art is known as a reflection of the contemporary time. Likewise, Priyam Pradhan’s paintings reflect the lifestyle, desires, obligations and more of today’s younger generation living in urban areas in Nepal.Pradhan himself is in his 20s and he has justified the want of most of the youngsters in their 20s, who might be declared adults and understand the need for money and materialistic things but are still kids at their heart who want to explore and experience life as much as possible.The exhibition has 27 paintings which Pradhan took around nine months to complete. According to him, while he was travelling the idea that his life was luxurious and him being capable of exploring anything he wanted to was because of money.And being an artist this concept lingered on him and he was compelled to create on the theme of money.Once you enter the gallery, you can also view an animated video, which introduces artist Pradhan and the importance of money, which is on the ground floor. On the first floor, a huge painting (193×62 in cm) Apatkalin Awastha using mixed media on canvas welcomes you and other paintings are small in size (18×30 in cm).“It is a team work and it is my introduction as an artist for the exhibition,” he says. “Also, being a recent multimedia graduate from Islington College, I wanted to explore my skills and I got my team. Then, like money, multimedia is relevant to current society.”Experiencing life through artPainting by artist Priyam Pradhan at Siddhartha Art Gallery, Baber Mahal. Photo: Chandra Bahadur Ale Priyam Pradhan says enjoyment is the meaning of life and he enjoys creating artwork. Moreover, Pradhan who came into the art world first being a tattoo artist feels blessed that he has the privilege to explore whatever he likes in his life.He also believes that the philosophy that says one should not be materialistic is wrong. “If material things are not important, why would one build a house? And after building a house why do they want to decorate their house?” he questions.Alongside, money and materialistic things, his paintings also explore love, romance, life and childhood experiences. Motifs like Pokemon, ramen noodles, animals, dancers, etc have been used in his paintings. In most of his paintings, he has used numerous white lines in wavy form and these lines for Pradhan indicate the sound or the energy that exists in the surroundings all the time.About using a pitta artist pen, he says, “I have enjoyed drawing and painting since my childhood and using a pitta artist pen helps me revisit that feeling of happiness and sense of freedom.”So many things happening on the canvas with the use of vibrant colours gives a sense of excitement to the viewers. Though referencing artists like Pollock, MF Husain, Picasso and more, his pen strokes give a sense of newness through his expression and thoughts about his life experiences.In his paintings, these bright colours and motifs are in harmony and are visual treats that can surely cheer up the mood of any visitor.

Nepal’s mighty libero: Salina Shrestha’s unmatched tenacity in Nepali women’s volleyball,"Entrepreneurship education is not just an investment in the education system; it is an investment in the nation’s future prosperity. Photo: Pexels/ Rodnae ProductionsIn the shadow of the towering Himalayas, Nepal faces a challenge that rivals the steepness of its mountainous terrain- the challenge of economic development. As the nation earnestly pursues its Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), it becomes increasingly evident that a transformation in the education system is not only necessary but also urgent. Rooted in common living strategies, the prevailing education model, especially in higher education, may not adequately prepare the youth for the demands of the modern world. In this critical juncture, the incorporation of entrepreneurship education emerges as a beacon of hope, offering a pathway towards a self-reliant and prosperous Nepal.Time to reevaluate the education systemNepal’s journey towards economic prosperity has been marked by challenges that demand innovative solutions. The commitment of the SDGs reflects not only a global responsibility but also a domestic imperative for sustainable development. For this, it is high time to reevaluate the education system in the country.The current education system in Nepal, deeply entrenched in common living strategies, has been the foundation of learning for generations. However, in the face of a rapidly evolving world, today’s generation aspires for more than the status quo. The call for independence reverberates through the aspirations of youth who seek a curriculum fostering critical thinking, innovation and entrepreneurial skills.Entrepreneurship education is a dynamic force capable of reshaping Nepal’s educational landscape. This innovative approach moves beyond traditional learning methods, providing students with the tools to navigate the complexities of the modern world. At its core, entrepreneurship education is about empowering students to implement learned information in practical and tangible ways.Consider a student engrossed in the intricacies of sensor systems during a science class, entrepreneurship education transforms this theoretical knowledge into practical applications, inspiring the creation of a sensor-operated door. Such innovation born from a fusion of science and entrepreneurship becomes a valuable mindset in solving practical problems.  Expanding the horizons of entrepreneurship education, let us delve into chemistry. Imagine students studying chemistry not just as a theoretical subject, but also as entrepreneurs in the making. Armed with entrepreneurial principles, these students can tap into Nepal’s rich biodiversity, exploring market demands for products derived from local plants.In the scenario, chemistry students could embark on a journey to develop performance-enhancing products based on market demand, harnessing the potential of indigenous flora. What makes this approach remarkable is that it does not necessarily require sophisticated machines or extensive human resources. Instead, it leverages the inherent skills and awareness of individuals within the community, paving the way for a grassroots economic revolution.Entrepreneurship in education Representational graphic. Image: FreepikThe beauty of entrepreneurship education lies in its universal applicability. It is not confined to science or chemistry alone. Consider an art student, for example. Through entrepreneurship education, they can understand what art to develop (product), how much to set the price (price), where to sell (place) and how to sell (promote) their artworks. Every subject becomes a canvas for innovation and enterprise.Moreover, entrepreneurship education is a powerful equaliser, recognising the unique skills and talents of individuals across various disciplines. It is not about fitting into a predefined mould but rather about unleashing the potential within each student. When every single person is aware of their skills and potential, they can rise to different levels, contributing to the overall progress of the nation.Entrepreneurship education goes beyond skill recognition; it is about nurturing the ability to produce goods and mastering the art of marketing. Returning to the example of the student developing a sensor-operated door, entrepreneurship education not only equips them to produce the product but also teaches them how to navigate the complexities of marketing it to potential users and clients.The impact of entrepreneurship education extends beyond individual success stories; it reverberates through the entire nation. A generation equipped with entrepreneurial skills becomes a driving force for economic growth and independence. They will be able to recognise the resources and ideas to utilise them to reach the global market. They will be able to be the pioneers in products and contribute to the economy. By fostering a culture of innovation, creativity and self-reliance, Nepal can reduce its dependence on external sources and strengthen its economy from within.In essence, entrepreneurship education is not just an investment in the education system; it is an investment in the nation’s future prosperity. It is a transformative force that has the potential to shape a generation of independent thinkers, innovators and entrepreneurs- the architects of a self-reliant and economically vibrant Nepal. Entrepreneurship education, by teaching students to utilise available resources (physical and financial) and make them commercial, becomes a cornerstone in the nation’s journey towards economic empowerment and independence.",['nepal ’ mighti libero : salina shrestha ’ unmatch tenac nepali women ’ volleybal'],"['entrepreneurship educ invest educ system ; invest nation ’ futur prosper .', 'photo : pexels/ rodna productionsin shadow tower himalaya , nepal face challeng rival steep mountain terrain- challeng econom develop .', 'nation earnestli pursu sustain develop goal ( sdg ) , becom increasingli evid transform educ system necessari also urgent .', 'root common live strategi , prevail educ model , especi higher educ , may adequ prepar youth demand modern world .', 'critic junctur , incorpor entrepreneurship educ emerg beacon hope , offer pathway toward self-reli prosper nepal.tim reevalu educ systemnep ’ journey toward econom prosper mark challeng demand innov solut .', 'commit sdg reflect global respons also domest imper sustain develop .', ', high time reevalu educ system country.th current educ system nepal , deepli entrench common live strategi , foundat learn gener .', 'howev , face rapidli evolv world , today ’ gener aspir statu quo .', 'call independ reverber aspir youth seek curriculum foster critic think , innov entrepreneuri skills.entrepreneurship educ dynam forc capabl reshap nepal ’ educ landscap .', 'innov approach move beyond tradit learn method , provid student tool navig complex modern world .', 'core , entrepreneurship educ empow student implement learn inform practic tangibl ways.consid student engross intricaci sensor system scienc class , entrepreneurship educ transform theoret knowledg practic applic , inspir creation sensor-oper door .', 'innov born fusion scienc entrepreneurship becom valuabl mindset solv practic problem .', 'expand horizon entrepreneurship educ , let us delv chemistri .', 'imagin student studi chemistri theoret subject , also entrepreneur make .', 'arm entrepreneuri principl , student tap nepal ’ rich biodivers , explor market demand product deriv local plants.in scenario , chemistri student could embark journey develop performance-enhanc product base market demand , har potenti indigen flora .', 'make approach remark necessarili requir sophist machin extens human resourc .', 'instead , leverag inher skill awar individu within commun , pave way grassroot econom revolution.entrepreneurship educ represent graphic .', 'imag : freepikth beauti entrepreneurship educ lie univers applic .', 'confin scienc chemistri alon .', 'consid art student , exampl .', 'entrepreneurship educ , understand art develop ( product ) , much set price ( price ) , sell ( place ) sell ( promot ) artwork .', 'everi subject becom canva innov enterprise.moreov , entrepreneurship educ power equalis , recognis uniqu skill talent individu across variou disciplin .', 'fit predefin mould rather unleash potenti within student .', 'everi singl person awar skill potenti , rise differ level , contribut overal progress nation.entrepreneurship educ goe beyond skill recognit ; nurtur abil produc good master art market .', 'return exampl student develop sensor-oper door , entrepreneurship educ equip produc product also teach navig complex market potenti user clients.th impact entrepreneurship educ extend beyond individu success stori ; reverber entir nation .', 'gener equip entrepreneuri skill becom drive forc econom growth independ .', 'abl recognis resourc idea utilis reach global market .', 'abl pioneer product contribut economi .', 'foster cultur innov , creativ self-reli , nepal reduc depend extern sourc strengthen economi within.in essenc , entrepreneurship educ invest educ system ; invest nation ’ futur prosper .', 'transform forc potenti shape gener independ thinker , innov entrepreneurs- architect self-reli econom vibrant nepal .', 'entrepreneurship educ , teach student utilis avail resourc ( physic financi ) make commerci , becom cornerston nation ’ journey toward econom empower independ .']"

Unprepared Nepal brace for challenging SAFF Championship campaign,"Ram Bujhaun Yadav with his land ownership certificate stands near a border pillar which he says was erroneously placed on his land. In October 2023, when 51-year-old Ram Bujhaun Yadav of Musaharnia Rural Municipality-5, Mukhiyapatti, Dhanusha, was at a relative’s house, someone told him that two Indian Sashastra Seema Bal (SSB) personnel were looking for him.Anxious, he rushed home wondering why they were looking for him.“They asked me if the paddy field in the no man’s land was mine. I told them yes and they asked me to cut down the paddy immediately,” he said.The paddy was not ripe and Yadav asked them for some time. However, the SSB personnel told him he had to cut down his paddy immediately.Ram Bujhaun and his wife Tetari Devi each own a 677-square-metre plot of land. As Nepal and India reevaluated the border, Ram Bujhan’s land was been deemed to be near the no man’s land as it now has two demarcation pillars.Frustrated, Ram Bujhaun cut the paddy before it was due to be harvested. Now, he has been asked to not plant anything on the land as it falls in the no man’s land.“Our border police don’t say a word. I can’t fight the SSB on my own,” says Ram Bujhaun adding he had decided not to plan anything on the land anymore.Woes of the farmersMany farmers in southern Nepal say their land has now been placed in India after the recent demarcation. When the Jamuna River, which flows through the no man’s land between Nepal and India, changed its course some two decades ago, some border pillars went missing. Locals say these pillars have now been placed encroaching on Nepali land.In 2018, with the then Chief District Officer of Dhanusha, Pradeep Raj Kandel, and an official from Madhubani district, Bihar, India, a team that included border security forces from both countries, the Armed Police Force of Nepal, and SSB of India began placing border pillars after land measurement by technicians.Locals have raised concerns, stating that border pillars have been positioned, encroaching approximately 50 to 100 meters of land into Nepal compared to the previous position. Many like Ram Bujhaun are unaware of when these border pillars were placed.“I did not know that pillar was placed here. After I found out when I asked the village leaders, many said they were placing the border pillars as they pleased,” said Ram Bujhaun.He was told to carry on planting paddy and that it would not matter as these issues had happened in the past. “They encroached on my land and have asked me not to plant anything. This is gross injustice,” he says.Ram Bujhaun’s family owns a total of 4,000 square metres of land, with 2,000 square metres belonging to him and the remaining 2,000 square metres to his brother Bechan. However, 1,000 square metres of his land is now located on the Indian side after the demarcation. Despite this, he has been farming on the land and continues to pay taxes to the Department of Land Management and Archive in Nepal.“They have marked my land to be on the Indian side and placed border pillars on it. I’ve been farming till now but I don’t know when they will ask me to stop,” he says.Ignorance of the governmentThe Madhesh province in southern NepalThe former ward chair of Mukhiyapatti Musharniya Rural Municipality-5, Ram Naresh Yadav, said that over time, India has encroached on numerous Nepali lands in various locations in the Madhesh Province. This, he says, happened due to the Nepali administration’s ignorance and weak stature.“They (Nepali administration) were careless and that meant the Indian side placed these border pillars by encroaching on Nepali land,” says Ram Naresh.He said that over 40 farmers from wards 1, 5, and 6 have land ranging from 300 to 1,600 square metres on the Indian side. “These farmers have land ownership certificates, but they cannot farm as the SSB says the land is in India and not Nepal,” said Ram Naresh.In 1996, land ownership certificates were distributed after surveying the land in the border area. Local Dharmendra Kumar Yadav said that since then, the locals have been paying their land tax regularly. In 2018, when the pillar was being placed, the locals protested when they saw their land was being encroached on. However, since the demarcation had been agreed upon by high-ranking government officials of Nepal and India, the farmer’s voices went unheard.“We tried to stop when the border pillars were being placed on our land. But the administrators from both sides forcibly put it there without even trying to hold a discussion,” said Harish Chandra Yadav. The Chief District Officer of Dhanusha, Chakrapani Pandey, says that the border pillars were placed by the technical team after the measurements and with the agreement of the high-ranking officials of the two countries.“The fields and houses that are built in no man’s land have recently been cleared. No one can do anything in this particular area,” said Pandey. “We understand the people’s concern but we cannot do anything about it now.”",['unprepar nepal brace challeng saff championship campaign'],"['ram bujhaun yadav land ownership certif stand near border pillar say erron place land .', 'octob 2023 , 51-year-old ram bujhaun yadav musaharnia rural municipality-5 , mukhiyapatti , dhanusha , rel ’ hous , someon told two indian sashastra seema bal ( ssb ) personnel look him.anxi , rush home wonder look him . “ ask paddi field man ’ land mine .', 'told ye ask cut paddi immedi , ” said.th paddi ripe yadav ask time .', 'howev , ssb personnel told cut paddi immediately.ram bujhaun wife tetari devi 677-square-metr plot land .', 'nepal india reevalu border , ram bujhan ’ land deem near man ’ land two demarc pillars.frustr , ram bujhaun cut paddi due harvest .', ', ask plant anyth land fall man ’ land . “ border polic ’ say word .', '’ fight ssb , ” say ram bujhaun ad decid plan anyth land anymore.wo farmersmani farmer southern nepal say land place india recent demarc .', 'jamuna river , flow man ’ land nepal india , chang cours two decad ago , border pillar went miss .', 'local say pillar place encroach nepali land.in 2018 , chief district offic dhanusha , pradeep raj kandel , offici madhubani district , bihar , india , team includ border secur forc countri , arm polic forc nepal , ssb india began place border pillar land measur technicians.loc rais concern , state border pillar posit , encroach approxim 50 100 meter land nepal compar previou posit .', 'mani like ram bujhaun unawar border pillar place . “ know pillar place .', 'found ask villag leader , mani said place border pillar pleas , ” said ram bujhaun.h told carri plant paddi would matter issu happen past .', '“ encroach land ask plant anyth .', 'gross injustic , ” says.ram bujhaun ’ famili own total 4,000 squar metr land , 2,000 squar metr belong remain 2,000 squar metr brother bechan .', 'howev , 1,000 squar metr land locat indian side demarc .', 'despit , farm land continu pay tax depart land manag archiv nepal . “ mark land indian side place border pillar .', '’ farm till ’ know ask stop , ” says.ignor governmentth madhesh provinc southern nepalth former ward chair mukhiyapatti musharniya rural municipality-5 , ram naresh yadav , said time , india encroach numer nepali land variou locat madhesh provinc .', ', say , happen due nepali administr ’ ignor weak statur . “ ( nepali administr ) careless meant indian side place border pillar encroach nepali land , ” say ram naresh.h said 40 farmer ward 1 , 5 , 6 land rang 300 1,600 squar metr indian side .', '“ farmer land ownership certif , farm ssb say land india nepal , ” said ram naresh.in 1996 , land ownership certif distribut survey land border area .', 'local dharmendra kumar yadav said sinc , local pay land tax regularli .', '2018 , pillar place , local protest saw land encroach .', 'howev , sinc demarc agre upon high-rank govern offici nepal india , farmer ’ voic went unheard . “ tri stop border pillar place land .', 'administr side forcibl put without even tri hold discuss , ” said harish chandra yadav .', 'chief district offic dhanusha , chakrapani pandey , say border pillar place technic team measur agreement high-rank offici two countri . “ field hous built man ’ land recent clear .', 'one anyth particular area , ” said pandey .', '“ understand peopl ’ concern anyth . ”']"
SAFF Championship 2023: Coach announces final squad for the tournament,"Regenerative braking representational image. Photo: FreepikThe electric vehicle market in Nepal has grown significantly over the past year. Electric four-wheelers and two-wheelers are being launched almost every month, spanning from passenger to commercial vehicles. Electric transportation appears to be an emerging trend in the automotive industry.New EVs are regularly introduced with advanced features as car companies develop unique electric platforms. One standout feature is regenerative braking.Regenerative braking was first introduced in 1967 by the American Motor Car Company (AMC) in their prototype electric vehicle, the AMC Amitron. However, Toyota became the automobile manufacturer to implement regenerative braking system (RBS) technology in their Prius series hybrid vehicles in 1997. Toyota brought up the new hybrid technology in the Prius when fuel prices were going up at a massive rate. 1997 Toyota Prius Hybrid. Photo: ToyotaBut what is regenerative braking? There are still many people confused about what it is, whether it is safe or helpful in fuel economy in hybrid cars and the regeneration of electricity in electric cars.In simple terms, regen braking is when a car saves energy by recharging its battery when you brake, helping it use less fuel or electricity and go further. Easy but scientifically, regen braking is a process used in vehicles where the kinetic energy produced during braking is converted into electrical energy through an electric motor acting as a generator. This electrical energy is then stored in the vehicle’s battery for later use, reducing energy wastage and increasing overall efficiency.Photo: FreepikRegen braking can be seen in all kinds of EVs, including cars, scooters, commercial vans, buses, bicycles, three-wheelers, and rickshaws. It now can be electrically managed to what extent the power and braking can be generated. Regenerative Braking work process in EVPrinciple of Operation: Regene braking works by turning the energy from slowing down into electricity.Electric Motor as a Generator: In EV or hybrid cars with regen braking, the motor changes roles from moving the car to making electricity when you brake.Switching Polarity: When you brake, the motor switches directions, turning energy from the wheels into electricity instead of using it to move the car.Generation of Electricity: The turning wheels make the motor produce electricity, which goes to the car’s battery.Power Electronics: Special electronics change the electricity from the motor into the right kind for charging the battery.Battery Charging: The electricity made during braking charges up the car’s battery, storing the energy for later.Integration with Hydraulic Braking System: Regenerative braking works with the regular brakes, blending them for smooth stopping.Photo: automotive-iqAdvantages and Disadvantages of Regenerative Braking The advantages are listed below:Energy Efficiency: Regenerative braking efficiently captures the kinetic energy generated during braking, effectively reducing energy wastage and contributing to a more sustainable driving experience.Extended Range: By using the energy that would otherwise be lost during braking as heat and sound, regenerative braking helps to extend the driving range of electric vehicles in instances such as travelling downhill. Reduced Brake Wear: Regenerative braking minimizes the strain on traditional braking components, mitigating wear and tear, and potentially extending the lifespan of the braking components such as brake pads, rotors and brake lines, thus reducing maintenance costs over time.Enhanced Driving Experience: Regenerative braking provides a smoother braking experience and a more responsive feel to drivers, enhancing overall driving comfort and control on the road.The disadvantages are listed below:Limited Effectiveness at Low Speeds: While regenerative braking efficiently recaptures energy during braking, its effectiveness diminishes at lower speeds which leads to decreased energy recovery compared to higher speeds.Complexity and Cost: Implementing regenerative braking adds complexity and cost to vehicle systems, potentially raising manufacturing and maintenance expenses, and impacting consumer affordability.Maintenance Requirements: Regenerative braking systems require periodic maintenance and calibration to ensure they operate optimally.Efficiency Variability: Regenerative braking may exhibit variability in efficiency under extreme weather conditions or on certain road surfaces, leading to fluctuations in overall energy recapture and impacting the vehicle’s efficiency.MisconceptionsFully Recharges Battery: Some mistakenly believe that regenerative braking fully replenishes the battery, but in reality, it only adds a modest amount of charge.Increases Braking Distances: There is a misconception that regenerative braking extends braking distances, but it enhances braking performance by complementing traditional brakes.High-Speed Only: While more effective at higher speeds, regenerative braking still functions at lower speeds, such as during city driving or stop-and-go traffic.Maintenance-Free: Despite requiring less maintenance than traditional brakes, regen braking systems still need periodic checks and maintenance to ensure proper operation.Significantly Boosts Range: While regen braking contributes to extending the driving range of electric vehicles, its impact is influenced by various factors beyond just braking efficiency.Only for Electric Cars: Although commonly associated with electric vehicles, regen braking systems are also found in some conventional vehicles, particularly those aiming to improve fuel efficiency with advanced technology.Photo: FreepikRegenerative braking might sound complicated, but it is pretty cool. Think of it as a way for EVs and hybrids to recycle energy when they slow down. Instead of just wasting that energy, regenerative braking turns it into electricity, which can then be used to power the battery.",['saff championship 2023 : coach announc final squad tournament'],"['regen brake represent imag .', 'photo : freepikth electr vehicl market nepal grown significantli past year .', 'electr four-wheel two-wheel launch almost everi month , span passeng commerci vehicl .', 'electr transport appear emerg trend automot industry.new ev regularli introduc advanc featur car compani develop uniqu electr platform .', 'one standout featur regen braking.regen brake first introduc 1967 american motor car compani ( amc ) prototyp electr vehicl , amc amitron .', 'howev , toyota becam automobil manufactur implement regen brake system ( rb ) technolog priu seri hybrid vehicl 1997 .', 'toyota brought new hybrid technolog priu fuel price go massiv rate .', '1997 toyota priu hybrid .', 'photo : toyotabut regen brake ?', 'still mani peopl confus , whether safe help fuel economi hybrid car regener electr electr cars.in simpl term , regen brake car save energi recharg batteri brake , help use less fuel electr go .', 'easi scientif , regen brake process use vehicl kinet energi produc brake convert electr energi electr motor act gener .', 'electr energi store vehicl ’ batteri later use , reduc energi wastag increas overal efficiency.photo : freepikregen brake seen kind ev , includ car , scooter , commerci van , buse , bicycl , three-wheel , rickshaw .', 'electr manag extent power brake gener .', 'regen brake work process evprincipl oper : regen brake work turn energi slow electricity.electr motor gener : ev hybrid car regen brake , motor chang role move car make electr brake.switch polar : brake , motor switch direct , turn energi wheel electr instead use move car.gener electr : turn wheel make motor produc electr , goe car ’ battery.pow electron : special electron chang electr motor right kind charg battery.batteri charg : electr made brake charg car ’ batteri , store energi later.integr hydraul brake system : regen brake work regular brake , blend smooth stopping.photo : automotive-iqadvantag disadvantag regen brake advantag list : energi effici : regen brake effici captur kinet energi gener brake , effect reduc energi wastag contribut sustain drive experience.extend rang : use energi would otherwis lost brake heat sound , regen brake help extend drive rang electr vehicl instanc travel downhil .', 'reduc brake wear : regen brake minim strain tradit brake compon , mitig wear tear , potenti extend lifespan brake compon brake pad , rotor brake line , thu reduc mainten cost time.enhanc drive experi : regen brake provid smoother brake experi respons feel driver , enhanc overal drive comfort control road.th disadvantag list : limit effect low speed : regen brake effici recaptur energi brake , effect diminish lower speed lead decreas energi recoveri compar higher speeds.complex cost : implement regen brake add complex cost vehicl system , potenti rais manufactur mainten expens , impact consum affordability.mainten requir : regen brake system requir period mainten calibr ensur oper optimally.effici variabl : regen brake may exhibit variabl effici extrem weather condit certain road surfac , lead fluctuat overal energi recaptur impact vehicl ’ efficiency.misconceptions recharg batteri : mistakenli believ regen brake fulli replenish batteri , realiti , add modest amount charge.increas brake distanc : misconcept regen brake extend brake distanc , enhanc brake perform complement tradit brakes.high-spe : effect higher speed , regen brake still function lower speed , citi drive stop-and-go traffic.maintenance-fre : despit requir less mainten tradit brake , regen brake system still need period check mainten ensur proper operation.significantli boost rang : regen brake contribut extend drive rang electr vehicl , impact influenc variou factor beyond brake efficiency.onli electr car : although commonli associ electr vehicl , regen brake system also found convent vehicl , particularli aim improv fuel effici advanc technology.photo : freepikregen brake might sound complic , pretti cool .', 'think way ev hybrid recycl energi slow .', 'instead wast energi , regen brake turn electr , use power batteri .']"

But in the gush of excitement to take exclusive photographs of the elusive cat, difficult to spot even in its prime habitats, there were few takers for the word of caution.Nepal’s Department of National Parks and Wildlife Conservation (DNPWC) organised the photo-op two days after the male subadult cat, which was until recently found in the country only at altitudes higher than 2,000-6,000 metres above sea level, was brought to the zoo from Urlabari town(146 m above sea level). According to the department, the animal has sustained injuries to its right foreleg and cannot stand upright.Although officials involved said they are looking at releasing the animal into the wild after it recuperates, doing so will be a daunting task, adding that the zoo may be the only place where it can now survive.Not a wild catReporters and photojournalists take photos of a snow leopard being held at the Central Zoo in Lalitpur, Nepal. Image by Abhaya Raj Joshi/ Mongabay“Nepali snow leopard experts have come up with two hypotheses to explain how the animal from the mountains landed up in the plains,” said Sharad Chandra Adhikari, member-secretary at the National Trust for Nature Conservation (NTNC), a semi-government body that manages the zoo in Lalitpur, a town in the Kathmandu Valley. The first of the two hypotheses made public during the photo-op-cum-press conference, is that it was raised in captivity and somehow managed to escape into the wild. The second is that it lost its orientation while trying to establish its territory after separating from its mother.Kulbhushansingh Suryawanshi, director of the India program, Snow Leopard Trust, said that both hypotheses are plausible explanations as to how the snow leopard got to the plains in Nepal.A DNPWC official, who wished to remain anonymous as he is not authorised to talk to the press, said that it was more likely that the animal had been raised in captivity. “The way it sipped the water and ate the food zoo staff offered indicates that it may have been raised in captivity,” the official said.Snow leopards are shy cats living at extreme altitudes in the steep mountainous areas of 12 countries in Central and South Asia. Their global population spread over altitudes of 500-5,800 m, is estimated to be between around 3,900 and 6,000 as detailed coordinated surveys of the population in the range countries are yet to be carried out. In Nepal, their population divided into three blocks (eastern, central and western) is estimated to be between 301 and 400.Adhikari from NTNC said that researchers will now examine the animal’s scat to analyse its diet and try to find out whether it was roaming in the wild or had been in some sort of captivity. Researchers are also preparing to analyse its genes to try to find out to which of the three metapopulations in Nepal it belongs. They will also observe the animal’s canine teeth and fur to look for clues.Relocation challenge A snow leopard found in Urlabari town in Nepal’s plains in a cage at the Central Zoo in Kathmandu. Photo: Aryan DhimalThe whole process could take a few months to complete, and summer could set in in Kathmandu by then, officials concede. “The current temperature in Kathmandu is suitable for snow leopards, as we are in the peak of winter,” said Madhu Chetri, a snow leopard researcher from NTNC. But that could change as spring season begins in the Northern Hemisphere.The DNPWC official said that regardless of the findings related to how the animal got to Urlabarli, the animal would have spent a significant amount of time with humans during its recovery phase. “That would mean that it would have gotten habituated with having humans around,” the official said.Sending such animals back into the wild is a challenge, as they may have lost their hunting and other adaptation skills, he added. In May last year, officials at the Chitwan National Park released two rescued rhino calves into the wild, with limited success. The safety of the animals, which had gotten used to having humans around, was compromised as poachers could easily approach and kill them. Eventually, they were transferred to an enclosure in eastern Nepal away from human intervention.Veteran conservationist Professor Karan Bahadur Shah said that rewilding the snow leopard would be a daunting task, as the animals are territorial. “If we just leave the animal in its natural habitat, it will get killed by other snow leopards defending their territory,” he said. “The best option would be to keep the animal in the zoo for the public to see.”But Nepal’s Central Zoo has its own set of problems. The facility, established in 1932 as a private collection, has limited space and has frequently run into financial trouble. Conservationists say the snow leopard would need special facilities to cater to its needs.“If the government decides that the snow leopard needs to remain at the zoo, we are ready to shoulder the responsibility,” said Adhikari. “We have set up special facilities for animals such as the red panda and chimpanzees,” he said. “We can do that for the snow leopard as well.”Those advocating for keeping the animal in the zoo also said that Nepal is a snow leopard range country and the public, especially the young generation, also needs to see the different animals found in the country. “It has great educational value,” said Shah.Snow leopard expert Suryawanshi from neighbouring India also said that it would be challenging to release the animal into the wild. “If the team at the zoo can establish the exact cause of this behaviour [why it ventured into the plains] and can keep the animal away from human contact, then it might be okay to release it back,” he said. “But otherwise, there is little hope for it in the wild. Better to let it live in the zoo.”Back at the zoo, after the photojournalists are done taking photos, it is the turn of the reporters to point their smartphones at the animal. Then there is a contingent of senior wildlife department officials waiting in line to catch a glimpse of the animal. “So much for keeping it away from human contact,” a conservationist observing the hullabaloo from a distance said.This story first appeared on Mongabay and Onlinekhabar is republishing it under a Creative Commons licence.","['acc women ’ t20 emerg team asia cup : nepal replac thailand , take india pakistan']","['snow leopard rescu urlabari current kept central zoo lalitpur .', 'photo : aryan dhimala gate vet clinic central zoo lalitpur open , two dozen photojournalist throng facil surround metal cage aim dslr camera snow leopard insid . “ pleas ’ come close anim , ” zoo ’ vet , radha krishna gharti , told approach photojournalist .', 'gush excit take exclus photograph elus cat , difficult spot even prime habitat , taker word caution.nep ’ depart nation park wildlif conserv ( dnpwc ) organis photo-op two day male subadult cat , recent found countri altitud higher 2,000-6,000 metr sea level , brought zoo urlabari town ( 146 sea level ) .', 'accord depart , anim sustain injuri right foreleg stand upright.although offici involv said look releas anim wild recuper , daunt task , ad zoo may place survive.not wild catreport photojournalist take photo snow leopard held central zoo lalitpur , nepal .', 'imag abhaya raj joshi/ mongabay “ nepali snow leopard expert come two hypothes explain anim mountain land plain , ” said sharad chandra adhikari , member-secretari nation trust natur conserv ( ntnc ) , semi-govern bodi manag zoo lalitpur , town kathmandu valley .', 'first two hypothes made public photo-op-cum-press confer , rais captiv somehow manag escap wild .', 'second lost orient tri establish territori separ mother.kulbhushansingh suryawanshi , director india program , snow leopard trust , said hypothes plausibl explan snow leopard got plain nepal.a dnpwc offici , wish remain anonym authoris talk press , said like anim rais captiv .', '“ way sip water ate food zoo staff offer indic may rais captiv , ” offici said.snow leopard shi cat live extrem altitud steep mountain area 12 countri central south asia .', 'global popul spread altitud 500-5,800 , estim around 3,900 6,000 detail coordin survey popul rang countri yet carri .', 'nepal , popul divid three block ( eastern , central western ) estim 301 400.adhikari ntnc said research examin anim ’ scat analys diet tri find whether roam wild sort captiv .', 'research also prepar analys gene tri find three metapopul nepal belong .', 'also observ anim ’ canin teeth fur look clues.reloc challeng snow leopard found urlabari town nepal ’ plain cage central zoo kathmandu .', 'photo : aryan dhimalth whole process could take month complet , summer could set kathmandu , offici conced .', '“ current temperatur kathmandu suitabl snow leopard , peak winter , ” said madhu chetri , snow leopard research ntnc .', 'could chang spring season begin northern hemisphere.th dnpwc offici said regardless find relat anim got urlabarli , anim would spent signific amount time human recoveri phase .', '“ would mean would gotten habitu human around , ” offici said.send anim back wild challeng , may lost hunt adapt skill , ad .', 'may last year , offici chitwan nation park releas two rescu rhino calv wild , limit success .', 'safeti anim , gotten use human around , compromis poacher could easili approach kill .', 'eventu , transfer enclosur eastern nepal away human intervention.veteran conservationist professor karan bahadur shah said rewild snow leopard would daunt task , anim territori .', '“ leav anim natur habitat , get kill snow leopard defend territori , ” said .', '“ best option would keep anim zoo public see . ” nepal ’ central zoo set problem .', 'facil , establish 1932 privat collect , limit space frequent run financi troubl .', 'conservationist say snow leopard would need special facil cater need . “ govern decid snow leopard need remain zoo , readi shoulder respons , ” said adhikari .', '“ set special facil anim red panda chimpanze , ” said .', '“ snow leopard well . ” advoc keep anim zoo also said nepal snow leopard rang countri public , especi young gener , also need see differ anim found countri .', '“ great educ valu , ” said shah.snow leopard expert suryawanshi neighbour india also said would challeng releas anim wild .', '“ team zoo establish exact caus behaviour [ ventur plain ] keep anim away human contact , might okay releas back , ” said .', '“ otherwis , littl hope wild .', 'better let live zoo . ” back zoo , photojournalist done take photo , turn report point smartphon anim .', 'conting senior wildlif depart offici wait line catch glimps anim .', '“ much keep away human contact , ” conservationist observ hullabaloo distanc said.thi stori first appear mongabay onlinekhabar republish creativ common licenc .']"
ANFA finally finds title sponsor for A Division league,"The National Assembly was formed to give experienced people a chance to be part of the parliament and help during the formation of important bills. In countries that follow the Westminster model of government, the upper house plays an important role. That, however, is not the case in Nepal as the country’s upper house has become a platform where individuals secure positions in the National Assembly based on their connections. As the election nears, many once again question the relevance and existence of the upper house.Things were different in the past as the initial years of the National Assembly saw experienced politicians and experts others in their field be nominated for the post. That slowly changed as the first batch completed its two-year term.“I understand why people are frustrated with the upper house. People expected experts but all we got was party cadres who lacked knowledge or experience,” says Bimala Rai Paudyal a National Assembly member. “Considering such behaviour and practices, what distinguishes the House of Representatives from the National Assembly?”A loser’s second chance Narayan Kaji Shrestha, who faced defeat in the 2017 general election from Gorkha-2, was elected as a member of the National Assembly on January 23, 2020. Elected from Gandaki Province, Shrestha currently is the Deputy Prime Minister and Home Minister of the country.Bhagwati Neupane who lost the election from Gandaki province and Bimala Ghimire who lost the election for mayorship in Bhanu Municipality also shared the same trajectory.Similarly, Mrigendra Kumar Singh Yadav and Jag Prasad Sharma were defeated in the House of Representatives elections, from Saptari-4 and Dang-3 respectively are now members of the National Assembly. Bam Dev Gautam, who lost the elections from Bardiya, secured a place in the upper house through nomination by President Bidya Devi Bhandari.Even those who did not win as ward member(s) got the opportunity to become members of the National Assembly including Sindh Bahadur Bishwakarma who was appointed on February 7, 2018. He is soon leaving his post on March 3.Despite the repeated criticisms, the political parties have not paid attention to this concern posed by political leaders and the general public. The latest proof of this is the list of candidates for the National Assembly elections scheduled on January 25. The list contains names like Krishna Prasad Sitaula, defeated in the House of Representatives elections in 2022 from Koshi Province, and Pooja Chaudhary, who lost in the provincial assembly elections 2022 from Rautahat-3 (a).Speaker Ganesh Prasad Timilsina, who led the National Assembly for the entire six years under the federal system, is also dissatisfied with the individuals who have made it to the upper house. “The allegations are something for the parties to ponder upon. The leaders should have prioritised involving intellectuals/neutrals rather than managing its members,” he says.The 59-member National Assembly elects eight representatives, equally from all seven provinces, with an additional three individuals nominated by the President. The Constitution ensures representation of women, Dalits, minorities or disabled communities, envisioning that experts, experienced individuals, and the most qualified people from various fields will become members of the National Assembly.Easy way inFile: A National Assembly meetingThere are some reasons why leaders aspire to join the upper house, and even the leadership create opportunities for them. In National Assembly elections, voters consist of local-level heads/deputy heads and provincial assembly members. Typically, individuals seeking these positions undergo a vetting process by their respective parties. As a result, aspiring members of parliament can focus less on persuading individual voters and more on gaining party support to secure their candidacy. Moreover, being a member of the National Assembly opens avenues to ministerial roles. The constitution prohibits a National Assembly member from becoming the Prime Minister, but not Deputy Prime Minister. Due to such opportunities, leaders are enticed to seek a position in the assembly.The National Assembly is currently in its fourth election cycle since the promulgation of the Consitution in 2015. Scheduled for January 25, this election aims to fill 19 seats vacated by individuals completing their six-year terms. The previous election cycles took place in 2017, involving 56 members, followed by 2019 with 18 positions, and 2020 with 19 positions.The cascading impactsFile: A National Assembly meetingAnother reason why the National Assembly is finding it difficult to justify itself is that it has become a shadow of the House of Representatives. The meeting of the National Assembly did not have one session when the House of Representatives was dissolved by then Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli twice. The demands and issues raised by the opposition parties in the House of Representatives automatically went to the National Assembly, where the parliamentarians of the ruling party put forward any proposal, they endorse it the same as in the House of Representatives.The latest example – is the main opposition UML did not allow the meeting of the House of Representatives to continue for five days from July 5, 2023, due to a statement made by Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal during his visit to India. Consequently, the meeting of the National Assembly was also paused during that period.The UML obstructed the House of Representatives for almost a month starting mid-July last year demanding a high-level inquiry committee to probe the 60-kilogram gold smuggling case and the resignation of the Home Minister. The National Assembly followed suit with leaders pushing their agendas forward.Speaker Ganesh Timilsina himself is dissatisfied that every behaviour and activity of the House of Representatives influence the National Assembly. He says despite his attempts to prevent the overshadowing, it has been unfortunate that he did not garner the goodwill of the top leaders during political disputes.Reinstating powerThe National Assembly is a permanent institution. Therefore, it can remain operational even in the absence of the House of Representatives. Under normal circumstances, Speaker Timilsina initiated a positive practice by personally participating in different committees. Nevertheless, in the absence of the House of Representatives, the National Assembly often experienced inactivity.In December 2020, the Prime Minister at that time, KP Sharma Oli, dissolved the House of Representatives. Subsequently, a session of the National Assembly was convened on January 1, 2021. Despite lasting only seven hours over four days, this session, which took place after the dissolution, failed to address crucial public issues. Even after six months, important matters remained unaddressed within the House.On May 22, 2021, the UML-led government once again dissolved the House of Representatives. The meeting of the National Assembly and committees was affected once more. However, the dissolutions were declared unconstitutional by the Supreme Court, reinstating the parliament.The Constitution says that despite the closing of the National Assembly session, thematic committee meetings can still take place. However, both the National Assembly and its committees remained inactive until the restoration of the House of Representatives.According to Khimlal Devkota, a member of the National Assembly, when the House of Representatives was dissolved twice, it seemed that the National Assembly was also in a state of dissolution.Bimala Rai Paudyal also believes that the inability to resume the upper house is a mark of weakness. “Since the government was not in a position to call, the President needed to be consulted by the chair together with the consultation committee. That was not done either,” she says.Constitutional and legal distinctionsExcept for the Constitution of Nepal (1962) and the Interim Constitution of Nepal (2007), all other constitutions in Nepal provided for a bicameral parliament with the National Assembly or the Upper House and the House of Representatives or the Lower House. The practices before 2015 were under the unitary governance system, but after the adoption of the federal democratic republican governance system, the role of the National Assembly has changed somewhat.In the preamble of the constitution prepared by the ‘Constituent Assembly, and Administrative Organ Designation Committee’ during the drafting of the constitution, it is mentioned that some different qualifications have been prescribed for being a member of the House of Representatives and the National Assembly, with the intention that qualified people can be represented in the National Assembly.Chair of the National Assembly Ganesh Prasad Timilsina restates that the members of the upper house should be assessed based on the country’s expectations with clear criteria. There is no definite definition of an expert in the constitution. It has been stated symbolically, “…It is expected that the members should have some basic skills to face the challenges and fulfil their responsibilities.”According to the constitution, the responsibility of the National Assembly is to correctly establish the rights of the local level, state, and union, and to prevent the House of Representatives from trying to enact laws contrary to the spirit of federalism. There is an explanatory comment in the constitution about the propriety of the National Assembly – “This House is expected to fulfil its role to maintain creative and mutual relations between the national government and the provinces.”In addition, there are some constitutional and legal differences regarding the National Assembly. But the MPs are demanding that it should cease. When a bill originating in the House of Representatives is passed and sent to the National Assembly, and if the latter does not decide within 60 days, it proceeds de facto.This has placed the National Assembly in a dilemma. The Chairman of the National Assembly, Timilsina, says, “Such an arrangement should also apply to the House of Representatives, or both should be equal.”Need for course correction PM Pushpa Kamal Dahal speaking in the National Assembly meeting.Some instances have turned these so-called experts into a laughing stock due to their actions. On July 5, 2023,  a discussion on the Electronic Commerce (E-Commerce) Bill 2023 was tabled in the National Assembly. However, the parliamentarians misunderstood the main point and instead discussed the matter of electricity. The MPs, who had not read the proposal, suggested that electricity consumption within Nepal should also be increased besides exporting electricity to India and Bangladesh.During the meeting, Ramesh Rijal, the Minister of Industry, Commerce and Supplies, also mentioned that India would purchase electricity during the Prime Minister’s visit. Unfortunately, the bill was unanimously approved.Timilsina considers the incident an example, that in his six-year tenure, he does not want to remember. Som Bahadur Thapa, a former secretary at the Parliament Secretariat, termed the incident ‘a joke’ in the Parliament of Nepal. “This is strong proof of the kind of MPs we have, who speak without knowing what they are talking about.” Timilsina assumed the role of the speaker/chair of the National Assembly after the establishment of the Federal Democratic Republic. He had the opportunity to establish the system and the dignity of the National Assembly. However, instead of setting a positive example, he will soon be retiring after being accused of playing tricks with the Speaker and showing interest in the work of the House of Representatives.Timilsina has repeatedly commented on the affairs of the House of Representatives. The latest instance was during a seminar on ‘Japan: Past, Present, and Future’ held in the capital on December 2, 2023, he publicly stated that the election results of the House of Representatives did not bode well.Pointing to the emergence of a new party and the victory of some independent candidates, he said, “In a democracy, you get to choose candidates, irrespective of their party affiliation. However, is the signal positive?”In August/ September 2022, Timilsina wrote a letter to the Election Commission, urging them to extend the tenure of Speaker and Deputy Speaker. Upon receiving a response stating that the Commission would not determine the tenure of the elected Parliament, Timilsina directed the Parliament Secretariat not to execute decisions made by the Management Committee after September 17, 2022.This created conflict between the Speaker of the House of Representatives and the Speaker of the National Assembly and in the crux of this dispute between the parties, the country had to bear the consequences of this conflict. Laws could not be enacted promptly, and the place once considered the domain of experts was overshadowed by the party’s interest. A study conducted by the Democracy Resource Center Nepal (DRCN) on the legislative functioning of the National Assembly has revealed that the Upper House has passed some bills that go against the spirit of federalism.The report’s concluding remarks say, “…the bills passed by the House of Representatives have not undergone significant changes or discussions in the National Assembly. The conclusion section of the study states that – “Furthermore, some bills, contradicting the spirit of federalism and addressing the interests of interest groups, have been approved by the National Assembly.”Overall, in the last six years, parties have introduced individuals who, given their presentation level, have raised questions about the National Assembly’s justification. If there are no changes in the constitution, laws, and policies concerning the upper assembly, these concerns will persist.”",['anfa final find titl sponsor divis leagu'],"['nation assembl form give

A Division League: Church Boys United become champion in debut season,"Representational image Photo by Tanushree Rao on UnsplashWhile most of the nation was preparing for the festival of lights, Tihar in early November 2023, something no less exciting was fuelling our sparks from oceans away. A queer art festival was happening for the seventeenth year and we had a chance to attend it as delegates. Our delegation was made possible through the collaboration between the Outburst Arts, an art organisation based in Northern Ireland, UK and the British Council, Nepal.There is a clear distinction between cities in terms of their flourishing arts scenes, and this became apparent during a visit to Belfast, Northern Ireland, specifically for the Outburst Queer Arts Festival held in the charming city centre. The organisation of such a festival requires months of careful preparation and planning.The queer art festival started as short events lasting a few days. Now, after 17 years, it has grown into a ten-day festival with panel discussions, theatre performances, and exhibitions. Program guides were available at venues, partner hotels, local libraries, and shops. Many delegates, including us, came from outside Northern Ireland to attend.During the queer art festival, we had the opportunity to connect with art curators, publishers, artists, and representatives from other British Council departments around the world (Lithuania, France, South Africa, Turkey, Greece, Jordan, England, and Argentina to name a few.) Each event that we attended gave us a different insight into what the arts can do and how it can facilitate connections. We gained insights from queer publishers and art curators on the challenges they face in their own countries due to resources and sometimes from bureaucracy in systems. We also got to see the way people can thrive when given a platform to showcase their works, such as an art exhibition in which the artist reimagined intimacy for queer people.On the other hand, Nepal struggles by and large at times for queer visibility. There are no explicit spaces for SOGIESC (Sexual Orientation, Gender Identity and Expressions and Sex Characteristics) artists to showcase their works nor openly come together as a community, it all exists in pocket spaces. In the same way, something that struck us was the presence of older queer artists at the festival. It was not just for one particular event during the queer art festival. We noticed an active participation and involvement of older queer people throughout the festival there. It was fascinating to see queer artists in their 40s and 50s share their transformative and inspiring work. Whereas, back home, the queer folks at the forefront of queer art, advocacy and activism are mostly Gen-Zs and millennials. We have very few queer elders that we can count on our fingers who are diligently working for Nepali queer folks. Even among them, some still hold onto archaic notions and refuse to evolve and embrace changes. So, there’s that.From dream to realityDuring the queer art festival, we had the opportunity to connect with art curators, publishers and artists. Photo by Raphael Renter | @raphi_rawr on UnsplashBefore being selected as delegates, both of us joined online meetings with British Council Nepal and the Outburst representatives facilitated through Kaalo 101 (an art space in Patan), along with interested queer artists from Nepal. We had a total of three meetings where we discussed the possibilities and challenges of doing a queer art festival in Nepal. The discourse also entailed us sharing a presentation about the updates of the queer art scene in Nepal in the last five years. The updates included memorable leaps taken in queer arts from music to literature and fashion and more by artists from diverse walks of life. Days after the third meeting, the British Council extended invitations to us to attend the Outburst Queer Arts Festival.Our delegation is just one example of the transcontinental collaboration because it was something that happened for the first time and involved us. But, Outburst Arts and the British Council have been practising cross-continental collaboration for years. Even in this year’s festival, we witnessed a lot of artists from different continents work together in exhibitions, lectures, panel discussions, magazines and so on. The amalgamation introduced us to brilliant thought-provoking work that defies gender and sociopolitical norms. The power of transcontinental collaboration was beyond beautiful.Imagining queer arts in NepalPhoto by Nikolas Gannon on UnsplashThe queer art scene in Nepal is an emerging one. While a full-fledged festival may not be possible now, something small yet significant is achievable. Time and again, different organisations have been running large art exhibitions/tours for weeks and months. However, in the microcosm that is Nepal, especially Kathmandu, the capital is no stranger to art-oriented programs. What it has been unfamiliar with precisely is queer art. And the unfamiliarity is not something induced by the lack of queer artists and their art. Sadly, it is because of inadequate platforms, space and resources to pursue queer arts.Despite this, through the years there have been events and literature that have emerged centring on queer identity, but it has not come without its challenges. On collections of stories, “Pride Climbing Higher” and “Songs of Revolution” showcase stories from Nepalis across Nepal. There are not many stories reflecting the Nepali queer experiences otherwise. June Pride Parade by Queer Youth Group has gained momentum as well in the past few years since its conception, from a small gathering to now a large parade with performances from community members. The same can be said about Blue Diamond Society’s (BDS) Rainbow Visibility Pride events in August during the festival of Saa-Paru (Gai Jatra) which has been running for well over a decade; in recent years they have included flash mobs and interaction programmes as well in lead up to their parade. Individuals within the community have also organised their queer gatherings with friends, thus coming back to the cosmos of pocket spaces in celebrating queerness.While artists like us are creative with what we want to put out, we still need organisations like the British Council to foster spaces and connections to enable us to do that. Then and again, artists have come together and collaborated on queer-centric projects. But, we need funding and resources to achieve bigger-scale projects that unite more artists and transcend borders.Both of us advocate for queer rights and are involved in programs and activities that push the narrative further, extend the visibility of the community and normalise conversations surrounding queerness. Among other things, we are also the founders of Queering The Bond, a networking collective for Nepali queer folks and Shuby is also the founder of Queer Honky-Tonk, a platform to promote queer performances and networking with events such as a drag show or open mic every few months. However, both of us, individually or collaboratively can only do so much. The challenges of living in a capitalistic world oftentimes outweigh the passion we have for the queer art scene in Nepal. And this is where we expect the government and organisations to step up with policies, platforms and programs to provide spaces, opportunities and resources for queer artists. Here, the British Council joined hands with Outburst Arts, which paved the way for our delegation. We would not have known about the marvellous queer art festival at the other end of the world otherwise.Besides the limitations brought by insufficient spaces and social unawareness, the centralised capital does hinder queer artists from outside the city to connect, create and collaborate. Art already is centralised and elitist. On top of that, the concentrated Kathmandu Valley is of no help when it comes to making art accessible beyond its borders.Furthermore, there is also the expectation from basically everyone to have the perfect festival that caters to all people’s needs and wants. While the festival, if it should happen, is bound to be done with the right intentions, there is a lot of pressure for the first-time event itself. The festival will be inclusive and diverse. But, realistically speaking, it would be a struggle to make it relevant to each queer person from east to west.Speaking of struggles, a visceral feeling of uneasiness swarmed over me with each step I took while exiting the airport after the flight back home. I, Birat, personally felt that I could not be as free or unrestrained in Nepal as I was during my time in Belfast. No wonder a lot of the queer people we know opt for abroad.Seventeen years ago, when the Outburst Queer Arts Festival first began, it certainly was not as celebrated or large as it is now. What we are trying to convey here is that we do not have to start big. We can aim for something small yet promising. While there might be expectations to check all the boxes, it is crucial to be mindful of our capacity as well. But, we can be capacitated and this is where you – people in power, art enthusiasts, grant and resource allocators and media come in. It is time we all believe in Nepali queer art and create space for it to not only survive but thrive. It is imperative to understand that formulating our imagination into reality can only be possible through unwavering collaboration.",['divis leagu : church boy unit becom champion debut season'],"['represent imag photo tanushre rao unsplashwhil nation prepar festiv light , tihar earli novemb 2023 , someth less excit fuell spark ocean away .', 'queer art festiv happen seventeenth year chanc attend deleg .', 'deleg made possibl collabor outburst art , art organis base northern ireland , uk british council , nepal.ther clear distinct citi term flourish art scene , becam appar visit belfast , northern ireland , specif outburst queer art festiv held charm citi centr .', 'organis festiv requir month care prepar planning.th queer art festiv start short event last day .', ', 17 year , grown ten-day festiv panel discuss , theatr perform , exhibit .', 'program guid avail venu , partner hotel , local librari , shop .', 'mani deleg , includ us , came outsid northern ireland attend.dur queer art festiv , opportun connect art curat , publish , artist , repres british council depart around world ( lithuania , franc , south africa , turkey , greec , jordan , england , argentina name . )', 'event attend gave us differ insight art facilit connect .', 'gain insight queer publish art curat challeng face countri due resourc sometim bureaucraci system .', 'also got see way peopl thrive given platform showcas work , art exhibit artist reimagin intimaci queer people.on hand , nepal struggl larg time queer visibl .', 'explicit space sogiesc ( sexual orient , gender ident express sex characterist ) artist showcas work openli come togeth commun , exist pocket space .', 'way , someth struck us presenc older queer artist festiv .', 'one particular event queer art festiv .', 'notic activ particip involv older queer peopl throughout festiv .', 'fascin see queer artist 40 50 share transform inspir work .', 'wherea , back home , queer folk forefront queer art , advocaci activ mostli gen-z millenni .', 'queer elder count finger dilig work nepali queer folk .', 'even among , still hold onto archaic notion refus evolv embrac chang .', ', ’ that.from dream realitydur queer art festiv , opportun connect art curat , publish artist .', 'photo raphael renter | @ raphi_rawr unsplashbefor select deleg , us join onlin meet british council nepal outburst repres facilit kaalo 101 ( art space patan ) , along interest queer artist nepal .', 'total three meet discuss possibl challeng queer art festiv nepal .', 'discours also entail us share present updat queer art scene nepal last five year .', 'updat includ memor leap taken queer art music literatur fashion artist divers walk life .', 'day third meet , british council extend invit us attend outburst queer art festival.our deleg one exampl transcontinent collabor someth happen first time involv us .', ', outburst art british council practis cross-continent collabor year .', 'even year ’ festiv , wit lot artist differ contin work togeth exhibit , lectur , panel discuss , magazin .', 'amalgam introduc us brilliant thought-provok work defi gender sociopolit norm .', 'power transcontinent collabor beyond beautiful.imagin queer art nepalphoto nikola gannon unsplashth queer art scene nepal emerg one .', 'full-fledg festiv may possibl , someth small yet signific achiev .', 'time , differ organis run larg art exhibitions/tour week month .', 'howev , microcosm nepal , especi kathmandu , capit stranger art-ori program .', 'unfamiliar precis queer art .', 'unfamiliar someth induc lack queer artist art .', 'sadli , inadequ platform , space resourc pursu queer arts.despit , year event literatur emerg centr queer ident , come without challeng .', 'collect stori , “ pride climb higher ” “ song revolut ” showcas stori nepali across nepal .', 'mani stori reflect nepali queer experi otherwis .', 'june pride parad queer youth group gain momentum well past year sinc concept , small gather larg parad perform commun member .', 'said blue diamond societi ’ ( bd ) rainbow visibl pride event august festiv saa-paru ( gai jatra ) run well decad ;

CAVA Men’s Volleyball: 3 new faces as team announced for tough tournament,"The month of January saw major road accidents in different parts of the country, including Lamhi in Dang, Dhorpatan in Baglung, and Chandragiri in Kathmandu. Road accidents have been common throughout the country with Nepal Police data suggesting over 2,500 people dying in them annually. Despite this, the Ministry of Finance has shown reluctance to introduce the proposed Road Safety Bill to reduce traffic accidents, fatalities, and serious injuries, and enhance road safety. Instead, the Finance Ministry has asked the Ministry of Physical Infrastructure and Transport to include the proposed bill in the Public Roads Act. Along with that, the government’s initiative to pass dedicated laws on road safety and set up a mechanism, including the empowered National Road Safety Council (NRSC), to decrease accidents, has come to a halt.Keshav Kumar Sharma, secretary of the Ministry of Physical Infrastructure and Transport, says they asked for a dedicated road safety law that comprehensively addresses institutional arrangements was the need of the hour. This includes ensuring safety in road construction, promoting public awareness, providing training and communication facilities, implementing rescue mechanisms, and arranging rehabilitation for families affected by road accidents. However, the Ministry of Finance believes a separate law is unnecessary due to concerns about potential increased financial burden.Hourly needOfficials from the Ministry of Physical Infrastructure allege that the Ministry of Finance is approaching sensitive matters, such as passenger safety, solely from an economic standpoint. They say that concerns related to road, vehicle, and passenger safety are being overshadowed, and there are indications that this approach will continue. “The government is avoiding addressing the sensitive issue of road accidents and the associated human and material costs, fearing an increase in expenses. This contradicts the government’s commitment and policy to reduce traffic accidents in the future,” says an official from the Ministry of Physical Infrastructure on the condition of anonymity.According to the Ministry of Physical Infrastructure, the existing laws lack the vision and purpose necessary for developing a sustainable, safe, risk-free, and reliable transportation operation and security system. Therefore, the Ministry of Physical Infrastructure officials argue that a distinct law is essential to decrease road accidents and ensure the safety of pedestrians, including passenger transport workers and roadside residents, as well as pets, wild animals, and birds. “The Road Safety Act is the need of the hour as it will help us during post-accident rescue, treatment management, rehabilitation, and legal representation,” says the official.Currently, there are gaps in enforcing road rules, monitoring vehicle capacities, ensuring road structure safety, managing traffic signs, and organizing road safety facilities. The implementation of the Road Safety Act is seen as crucial to address these issues.However, there has not been a facilitative environment for providing education and raising awareness about road traffic safety, safety mechanisms, and coordinating among organisations related to road transport. The aspect of training drivers with skills and knowledge, as well as monitoring road safety on the roads, is also lacking. This is why experts have been suggesting introducing a separate road safety law to address these aspects.The Finance Ministry, however, says that road safety should not be downplayed by ignoring human sensibilities related to road safety and citing economic reasons. Officials from the Ministry of Physical Infrastructure argue that incorporating safety considerations in the Road Act does not automatically result in a decrease in accidents or the integration of post-accident rescue, relief, and rehabilitation efforts.“The existing laws do not address road safety anywhere. Due to its lack of clarity and inadequacy, it has not been implemented with due diligence. For instance, provisions such as those for vehicle inspectors outlined in the Transport Act have not been acted upon by the government,” says an official from the Transport Ministry.Policies and commitments, but no lawsThe Motor Vehicles and Transport Management Act (1993) includes several provisions related to vehicle registration, road permits, driver’s licenses, traffic management, insurance, and penalties. The Public Roads Act (1974) primarily focuses on road management. However, there is no provision in the Act regarding the National Road Safety Council.In this situation, Nepal has developed a 10-year road safety action plan but is yet to enact corresponding legislation. Unfortunately, government agencies and mechanisms are not obligated to follow the action plan, as it lacks legal guidance.Now, the Transport Ministry holds the view that if safety considerations are explicitly addressed in the Public Roads Act, the outcome will not differ from what the Finance Ministry has said. Given the Public Roads Act’s close association with the Department of Road, the ministry thinks greater emphasis will be placed on road construction. However, they argue that incorporating the road safety aspect into the Act would not be effective.Secretary Sharma of the Transport Ministry is tasked with ensuring road safety, overseeing physical infrastructure and transport, and coordinating efforts across education, health, home, law, federal affairs, and general administration ministries. This responsibility extends to provincial ministries, local levels, as well as various agencies, organisations, security agencies, non-governmental organisations, and related entities, each with their specific roles.“As all the agencies need to be allocated responsibilities for various aspects of road safety, we have requested them to collaborate in formulating a distinct law. This should encompass the reduction of all types of accidents,” said Sharma.The ministry believes that a dedicated law addressing road safety is crucial to mitigate severe road accidents in Nepal and to uphold the commitments made by the country on the international stage.Nepal has committed to implementing the Stockholm Declaration through the Global Road Traffic Safety Conference in 2020, as per the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. Nepal, which has incorporated sustainable development goals into its national development plan, has not yet commenced work aligned with these objectives.Nevertheless, Nepal’s neighbouring countries are already addressing road safety through legal frameworks. Various states in India have enacted road safety laws, and the effectiveness of these laws is contributing to a 50 per cent reduction in road accidents.In 1999, Bhutan also introduced a unified road safety and transport act. Pakistan, on the other hand, issued the National Highway Safety Ordinance-2000 to ensure road safety, distinct from its National Highway Authority Act (1991). Britain, Australia, America, New Zealand, and other countries have established separate road safety laws as well.Road safety neglectedIn Nepal, road safety has been consistently neglected due to the absence of dedicated legislation. Road safety expert Keshav Adhikari says that the government primarily focused on road construction, overlooks crucial aspects such as road safety and reinforcement. Consequently, roads are transforming into perilous pathways for both vehicles and passengers.“There is a lack of interest in formulating policies and laws aimed at mitigating financial losses resulting from accidents,” says Adhikari.He further points out that safety is not a governmental priority, as expanding the road network is perceived to yield more political benefits than implementing additional structures to enhance road safety.“When I worked as an expert in the Transport Ministry for over a year, I realised that promoting road safety is not a government priority,” he says. “Annually, more people die due to road accidents than those who die in natural disasters, but the government has not given it much attention.”Even though the prime minister, ministers, and MPs keep asserting that roads have been constructed, no one seems to be addressing the critical issues of road safety and quality.Saroj Sitaula, General Secretary of the Federation of Nepalese National Transport Entrepreneurs (FNNTE), says that the government must be attentive as accidents are on the rise due to various technical and human factors, including road infrastructure. “Many accidents can be mitigated by improving road conditions, installing barriers on the sides, putting up informational boards, and ensuring scientific and practical road markings,” he says. “We need to formulate a plan and progress accordingly.”Sitaula argues that the government should establish policies to create mechanisms for emergency rescue, treatment, and rehabilitation after an accident occurs. He emphasises the importance of enhancing road infrastructure, conducting a scientific examination of the technical condition of vehicles, and ensuring compliance with the law by drivers, passengers, and regulators. He says that blaming drivers and transport entrepreneurs for accidents is inadequate, and the government must fulfil its responsibilities.Roads are unsafeNepal currently boasts a road network spanning approximately 100,000 km, with the majority consisting of dirt and gravel roads. Among the more than 22,000 kilometres of national and subsidiary highways, numerous sections remain unpaved.Despite the government’s substantial investment in road construction and expansion, minimal efforts are allocated to ensuring road safety. Recently, all three levels of government have accelerated the widening of roads, incorporating asphalt and slopes. However, it appears that issues concerning road quality and safety are escalating at a faster pace. Roads that have been neglected in the guise of maintenance have become a nightmare for the public.Infrastructure expert Suryaraj Acharya notes that these problems arise due to the tendency to construct roads only after they have sustained damage, without considering potential issues during the initial construction phase.",['cava men ’ volleybal : 3 new face team announc tough

Realme recently has been focusing a lot on the design aspect and the price range performance. The 12 Pro+ has some major differences from last year’s 11 Pro+ which include design, IP rating, chipset, camera and charging. Let us see what the luxuriously designed smartphone delivers in terms of specs.Specifications of Realme 12 Pro+ 5GDimensionsLength: 161.47mmWidth: 74.02mmDepth: 8.75mmWeight196 gramsDisplay typeAMOLEDDisplay size6.7-inchResolution2,412 x 1,080 (FHD+)Refresh rateUp to 120HzIP ratingIP65 dust and water resistance Glass Protection0.55mm Double-Reinforced GlassChipsetSnapdragon 7s Gen 2 (4nm)CPUOcta-core (4×2.40 GHz Cortex-A78 & 4×1.95 GHz Cortex-A55)GPUAdreno 710OSRealme UI 5.0 based on Android 14RAM8GB | 12GBStorage128GB | 256GBRear camera 50MP Sony IMX890 main camera8MP ultra-wide camera64MP periscope portrait cameraSelfie camera32MP Wi-Fi802.11 a/b/g/n/ac/ax（Wi-Fi 6）Bluetooth5.2NetworkLTE | 5GSIMDual Nano SIMAudioDual SpeakersSupports Dolby AtmosDual-mic Noise CancellationHi-Res Audio CertificationSensorsGeomagnetic sensor, Proximity sensor, Light sensor, Acceleration sensor, Gyroscope, In-display fingerprint sensorBattery5,000mAh (typ)Charging67W SUPERVOOC wired fast chargingPorts and Buttons2 Nano SIM Card SlotsType-C PortPower ButtonVolume ButtonsColoursSubmarine BlueNavigator BeigeExplorer RedPrice (expected)Rs 50,000 (8/128GB)Rs 54,000 (8/256GB)Rs 60,000 (12/256GB)Design and DisplayThe Realme 12 Pro+ and the Realme 12 Pro share the same design and dimensions. The design is fascinating. Realme patterned up with Luxury Swiss Watch designer Ollivier Savéo to craftfully design the smartphone. All the colour options have a vegan leather back. Since the phone is designed by a luxury watch designer, it comes with a big round camera module housing the triple camera setup. There is a golden 3D Jubilee Bracelet which gives the texture of a luxury watch strap. A golden patterned line runs through the middle and around the camera module for an even better look.Realme 12 Pro+ 5G designer Ollivier Savéo.

On the front, the 12 Pro+ 5G has a curved screen with a centred hole-punch cutout which houses the selfie camera. The bezels are minimal with the sides being curved almost zero while the top and the chin have a slight ear-like bezel.

Photo: Realme IndiaPerformance and StorageThe performance has also been stepped up with the change from MediaTek Chipset in the 11 Pro series to Snapdragon chipsets in the 12 Pro series. The Realme 12 Pro+ 5G is powered by the Snapdragon 7s Gen 2 chipset built on a 4nm processor. It has an octa-core CPU, which includes Cortex-A78 and Cortex-A55 cores for seamless multitasking and responsiveness. The Adreno 710 GPU handles the graphics for gaming and multimedia. Photo: Realme IndiaIt runs on the Realme UI 5.0 based on Android 14. The overall software experience is good but Realme gets back to the cost-cutting techniques in the software part with a bunch load of pre-installed hot apps and hot games. It also has a 3D VC liquid cooling system which spans 3394mm² and covers the main heat sources of the motherboard giving a boost in heat dissipation efficiency.Photo: Realme IndiaThe Realme 12 Pro+ 5G is available in two RAM options which include 8GB and 12GB. The 8GB RAM is paired with 128GB and 256GB storage options while the 12GB RAM is paired with 256GB of storage. It also has a Dynamic RAM feature which helps to increase the RAM size up to 24GB using the internal storage.Photo: Realme IndiaCameraThe camera on the Realme 12 Pro+ 5G is also interesting. Here, Realme has partnered up with Chilean cinematographer Claudio Miranda. He has worked in films such as Life of Pi, Top Gun: Maverick, The Curious Case of Benjamin Button and Tron: Legacy. He has also won an Academy Award for Best Cinematography for his role in Life of Pi in 2013. Claudio Miranda has worked with Realme for fine-tuning images. There are also three film filters made in collaboration with Claudio Miranda with unique colour grading matched with a 2.39:1 aspect ratio and cinematic-level bokeh adjustment. The filters are Journey, Maverick and Memory. Photo: Realme IndiaThe Realme 12 Pro+ 5G has a triple camera setup at the rear. The main camera features a 50MP Sony IMX890 sensor with OIS for steady and stable shots. It has a resolution of 4,096 x 3,072 and an aperture of f/1.8, while the 24mm equivalent focal length provides a wide field of view (FOV) of 84°.Photo: Realme IndiaInstead of using a macro camera or a depth sensor, Realme has stepped the game with a 64MP periscope portrait camera with an OmniVision OV64B sensor. It delivers a resolution of 4,624 x 3,472 and supports OIS for steady telephoto shots. With an aperture of f/2.8 and a focal length equivalent to 71mm, it delivers impressive portrait shots with a narrow FOV of 33° and 3x optical zoom. The last camera is an 8MP ultra-wide camera, providing a wide range of view with a focal length equivalent to 16mm and an aperture of f/2.2 and FOV of 112°.Photo: Realme IndiaThe rear camera has a lot of photography features including Auto-zoom, street photography mode, moon mode, starry mode pro, super nightscape, pano, professional mode, portrait mode, HDR, AI scene recognition, AI beauty, filters, text scanner, portrait distortion correction, one take and a super group portrait.Photo: Realme IndiaAs for video shooting, the rear camera of the Realme 12 Pro+ 5G can shoot 4K videos at 30fps, 1080p and 720p videos at both 30fps and 60fps.

ANFA cancels national team training camp,"Ram Bujhaun Yadav with his land ownership certificate stands near a border pillar which he says was erroneously placed on his land. In October 2023, when 51-year-old Ram Bujhaun Yadav of Musaharnia Rural Municipality-5, Mukhiyapatti, Dhanusha, was at a relative’s house, someone told him that two Indian Sashastra Seema Bal (SSB) personnel were looking for him.Anxious, he rushed home wondering why they were looking for him.“They asked me if the paddy field in the no man’s land was mine. I told them yes and they asked me to cut down the paddy immediately,” he said.The paddy was not ripe and Yadav asked them for some time. However, the SSB personnel told him he had to cut down his paddy immediately.Ram Bujhaun and his wife Tetari Devi each own a 677-square-metre plot of land. As Nepal and India reevaluated the border, Ram Bujhan’s land was been deemed to be near the no man’s land as it now has two demarcation pillars.Frustrated, Ram Bujhaun cut the paddy before it was due to be harvested. Now, he has been asked to not plant anything on the land as it falls in the no man’s land.“Our border police don’t say a word. I can’t fight the SSB on my own,” says Ram Bujhaun adding he had decided not to plan anything on the land anymore.Woes of the farmersMany farmers in southern Nepal say their land has now been placed in India after the recent demarcation. When the Jamuna River, which flows through the no man’s land between Nepal and India, changed its course some two decades ago, some border pillars went missing. Locals say these pillars have now been placed encroaching on Nepali land.In 2018, with the then Chief District Officer of Dhanusha, Pradeep Raj Kandel, and an official from Madhubani district, Bihar, India, a team that included border security forces from both countries, the Armed Police Force of Nepal, and SSB of India began placing border pillars after land measurement by technicians.Locals have raised concerns, stating that border pillars have been positioned, encroaching approximately 50 to 100 meters of land into Nepal compared to the previous position. Many like Ram Bujhaun are unaware of when these border pillars were placed.“I did not know that pillar was placed here. After I found out when I asked the village leaders, many said they were placing the border pillars as they pleased,” said Ram Bujhaun.He was told to carry on planting paddy and that it would not matter as these issues had happened in the past. “They encroached on my land and have asked me not to plant anything. This is gross injustice,” he says.Ram Bujhaun’s family owns a total of 4,000 square metres of land, with 2,000 square metres belonging to him and the remaining 2,000 square metres to his brother Bechan. However, 1,000 square metres of his land is now located on the Indian side after the demarcation. Despite this, he has been farming on the land and continues to pay taxes to the Department of Land Management and Archive in Nepal.“They have marked my land to be on the Indian side and placed border pillars on it. I’ve been farming till now but I don’t know when they will ask me to stop,” he says.Ignorance of the governmentThe Madhesh province in southern NepalThe former ward chair of Mukhiyapatti Musharniya Rural Municipality-5, Ram Naresh Yadav, said that over time, India has encroached on numerous Nepali lands in various locations in the Madhesh Province. This, he says, happened due to the Nepali administration’s ignorance and weak stature.“They (Nepali administration) were careless and that meant the Indian side placed these border pillars by encroaching on Nepali land,” says Ram Naresh.He said that over 40 farmers from wards 1, 5, and 6 have land ranging from 300 to 1,600 square metres on the Indian side. “These farmers have land ownership certificates, but they cannot farm as the SSB says the land is in India and not Nepal,” said Ram Naresh.In 1996, land ownership certificates were distributed after surveying the land in the border area. Local Dharmendra Kumar Yadav said that since then, the locals have been paying their land tax regularly. In 2018, when the pillar was being placed, the locals protested when they saw their land was being encroached on. However, since the demarcation had been agreed upon by high-ranking government officials of Nepal and India, the farmer’s voices went unheard.“We tried to stop when the border pillars were being placed on our land. But the administrators from both sides forcibly put it there without even trying to hold a discussion,” said Harish Chandra Yadav. The Chief District Officer of Dhanusha, Chakrapani Pandey, says that the border pillars were placed by the technical team after the measurements and with the agreement of the high-ranking officials of the two countries.“The fields and houses that are built in no man’s land have recently been cleared. No one can do anything in this particular area,” said Pandey. “We understand the people’s concern but we cannot do anything about it now.”",['anfa cancel nation team train camp'],"['ram bujhaun yadav land ownership certif stand near border pillar say erron place land .', 'octob 2023 , 51-year-old ram bujhaun yadav musaharnia rural municipality-5 , mukhiyapatti , dhanusha , rel ’ hous , someon told two indian sashastra seema bal ( ssb ) personnel look him.anxi , rush home wonder look him . “ ask paddi field man ’ land mine .', 'told ye ask cut paddi immedi , ” said.th paddi ripe yadav ask time .', 'howev , ssb personnel told cut paddi immediately.ram bujhaun wife tetari devi 677-square-metr plot land .', 'nepal india reevalu border , ram bujhan ’ land deem near man ’ land two demarc pillars.frustr , ram bujhaun cut paddi due harvest .', ', ask plant anyth land fall man ’ land . “ border polic ’ say word .', '’ fight ssb , ” say ram bujhaun ad decid plan anyth land anymore.wo farmersmani farmer southern nepal say land place india recent demarc .', 'jamuna river , flow man ’ land nepal india , chang cours two decad ago , border pillar went miss .', 'local say pillar place encroach nepali land.in 2018 , chief district offic dhanusha , pradeep raj kandel , offici madhubani district , bihar , india , team includ border secur forc countri , arm polic forc nepal , ssb india began place border pillar land measur technicians.loc rais concern , state border pillar posit , encroach approxim 50 100 meter land nepal compar previou posit .', 'mani like ram bujhaun unawar border pillar place . “ know pillar place .', 'found ask villag leader , mani said place border pillar pleas , ” said ram bujhaun.h told carri plant paddi would matter issu happen past .', '“ encroach land ask plant anyth .', 'gross injustic , ” says.ram bujhaun ’ famili own total 4,000 squar metr land , 2,000 squar metr belong remain 2,000 squar metr brother bechan .', 'howev , 1,000 squar metr land locat indian side demarc .', 'despit , farm land continu pay tax depart land manag archiv nepal . “ mark land indian side place border pillar .', '’ farm till ’ know ask stop , ” says.ignor governmentth madhesh provinc southern nepalth former ward chair mukhiyapatti musharniya rural municipality-5 , ram naresh yadav , said time , india encroach numer nepali land variou locat madhesh provinc .', ', say , happen due nepali administr ’ ignor weak statur . “ ( nepali administr ) careless meant indian side place border pillar encroach nepali land , ” say ram naresh.h said 40 farmer ward 1 , 5 , 6 land rang 300 1,600 squar metr indian side .', '“ farmer land ownership certif , farm ssb say land india nepal , ” said ram naresh.in 1996 , land ownership certif distribut survey land border area .', 'local dharmendra kumar yadav said sinc , local pay land tax regularli .', '2018 , pillar place , local protest saw land encroach .', 'howev , sinc demarc agre upon high-rank govern offici nepal india , farmer ’ voic went unheard . “ tri stop border pillar place land .', 'administr side forcibl put without even tri hold discuss , ” said harish chandra yadav .', 'chief district offic dhanusha , chakrapani pandey , say border pillar place technic team measur agreement high-rank offici two countri . “ field hous built man ’ land recent clear .', 'one anyth particular area , ” said pandey .', '“ understand peopl ’ concern anyth . ”']"
A Division clubs refuse to release players before league ends,"Photo by pippen on UnsplashLife is filled with surprises and unexpected events and it can change at any moment. The only thing certain in life is the uncertainty. Change is a natural and inevitable part of our lives, and it may be positive as well as negative.Even though it is not guaranteed that we will wake up in the morning, we set the alarm every night with the hope that we will wake up in the morning. We do not know what each day is going to bring us, but we may have varieties, adventures, and endless opportunities.The push to exploreThe uncertainty sometimes forces us to explore those aspects of life, we never knew existed or needed. It also tests the mental strength of people and how they deal with it. The uncertainty has taught me to be grateful, as we never know what life throws at us.In life, everything does not go according to our plans, and if we do not embrace the change we will face huge trouble. The Covid-19 pandemic is the best example of uncertainty, we were constantly fearing death and it was uncertain that we would see the sunrise the next day.It is not certain that every decision in life will be correct, but if you fear not trying at all, you miss endless opportunities for learning and growing. When our decisions or outcomes are on the negative side, we get depressed and we might tend to think about committing suicide, but we forget that if we have life we have endless opportunities. Most of us plan for our careers, our love life, etc. and when those plans do not work out we start getting uncomfortable. But if we can deal with today, we can surely deal with tomorrow. We need to cherish little moments in our lives and know that nothing is permanent not even the failures and setbacks.We come here with nothing and leave with nothing. So why should we hold the egos and grudges against each other? Instead of making our life meaningful and enjoying the journey of life, we get into puzzles of accumulating wealth and we go against our own loved ones for it. Change is certainPhoto by Kathyryn Tripp on UnsplashNothing is permanent in life, everything can change in fractions of seconds. In today’s society, everyone is so busy, that we people have so less time for our loved ones. What I have learned over the years, is to find time in our busy schedule for our family because we never know when it will be our last day together with them. Yes! Death is a natural process, so if you have to die someday, why should you die with grudges in your heart? But instead of worrying about the inevitable, focusing on the things you can control will bring a lot of happiness in life.Uncertainty is not only a negative thing; it also brings a lot of opportunity because you dare to change. The life-changing experience will not come knocking down your door, you need to expose yourself. We learn by doing and experimenting, even though we might fail. But that is not the end of the world. I still remember hesitating while applying for the role of leadership, at my school level as it was not certain that I would be chosen.Even after being selected, I was uncertain about whether I could fulfil my responsibilities or not. But that uncertainty helped me grow out of my comfort zone and give my best input. If I had not applied for that role just because I was uncertain of the outcome, I would miss the biggest learning opportunity in my school life. So, do not let the uncertainty or the unknown ever stop you from trying and no matter how much we try, to plan life always finds a way to surprise us. It is important to stay grounded when we have everything we wish for because life can take such a turn that we had never expected in our wildest dreams. Similarly, nothing is permanent in life, the financial hardships, the grades, the breakups, etc. But the most important thing is not to lose hope during those difficult times.According to the data provided by Nepal police, around 6,830 people took their lives in the fiscal year 2022/23. There is nothing in life that cannot be resolved although it may take time, committing suicide should not be an option. It’s important to share feelings among family members or loved ones because together as a family any problem can be overcome.Embrace the unknown and focus on enhancing your life, instead of worrying about what will happen next. Always find time for your loved ones, as life is uncertain. We should be grateful that we are alive and accept that change is the only constant thing in life. Do not let the unknown, stop you from trying or achieving your goals and always remember that even if you fail, you still have endless opportunities.",['divis club refus releas player leagu end'],"['photo pippen unsplashlif fill surpris unexpect event chang moment .', 'thing certain life uncertainti .', 'chang natur inevit part live , may posit well negative.even though guarante wake morn , set alarm everi night hope wake morn .', 'know day go bring us , may varieti , adventur , endless opportunities.th push exploreth uncertainti sometim forc us explor aspect life , never knew exist need .', 'also test mental strength peopl deal .', 'uncertainti taught grate , never know life throw us.in life , everyth go accord plan , embrac chang face huge troubl .', 'covid-19 pandem best exampl uncertainti , constantli fear death uncertain would see sunris next day.it certain everi decis life correct , fear tri , miss endless opportun learn grow .', 'decis outcom neg side , get depress might tend think commit suicid , forget life endless opportun .', 'us plan career , love life , etc .', 'plan work start get uncomfort .', 'deal today , sure deal tomorrow .', 'need cherish littl moment live know noth perman even failur setbacks.w come noth leav noth .', 'hold ego grudg ?', 'instead make life meaning enjoy journey life , get puzzl accumul wealth go love one .', 'chang certainphoto kathyryn tripp unsplashnoth perman life , everyth chang fraction second .', 'today ’ societi , everyon busi , peopl less time love one .', 'learn year , find time busi schedul famili never know last day togeth .', 'ye !', 'death natur process , die someday , die grudg heart ?', 'instead worri inevit , focus thing control bring lot happi life.uncertainti neg thing ; also bring lot opportun dare chang .', 'life-chang experi come knock door , need expos .', 'learn experi , even though might fail .', 'end world .', 'still rememb hesit appli role leadership , school level certain would chosen.even select , uncertain whether could fulfil respons .', 'uncertainti help grow comfort zone give best input .', 'appli role uncertain outcom , would miss biggest learn opportun school life .', ', let uncertainti unknown ever stop tri matter much tri , plan life alway find way surpris us .', 'import stay ground everyth wish life take turn never expect wildest dream .', 'similarli , noth perman life , financi hardship , grade , breakup , etc .', 'import thing lose hope difficult times.accord data provid nepal polic , around 6,830 peopl took live fiscal year 2022/23 .', 'noth life resolv although may take time , commit suicid option .', '’ import share feel among famili member love one togeth famili problem overcome.embrac unknown focu enhanc life , instead worri happen next .', 'alway find time love one , life uncertain .', 'grate aliv accept chang constant thing life .', 'let unknown , stop tri achiev goal alway rememb even fail , still endless opportun .']"
