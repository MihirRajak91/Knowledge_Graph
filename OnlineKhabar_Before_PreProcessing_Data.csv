Nepali basketball prodigies aim to lift the scene
","Rinchhen Moktan and Bina Mani Younjan
Rinchhen Moktan and Bina Mani Younjan, aged 18 and 17 respectively, are emerging talents in the Nepali basketball scene.
With many calling them the future of Nepali basketball, the two are excelling in different formats of the game. Moktan was part of Nepal’s women’s basketball team that took part in the Asian Games in China while Younjan made her full-court debut during the 2023 SABA Women’s Basketball Championship.
Recently, the two helped Budhanilkantha Basketball Club win the U19 Women National Basketball Championship organized by the National Basketball Association with Moktan even earning the coveted title of most valuable player (MVP).
“I was so happy to be part of the winning team and be dubbed the MVP in the U19 championship that was held after ages, ” says Moktan.
Now, the two hope that more tournaments are held in the country so they can raise their game as they hope to prepare well for international tournaments. They believe that this aspect is currently lacking in their preparation and is essential for them to compete with other countries on the global stage.
“We both played internationally for Nepal and found the domestic matches easy. The more we play the better we will get as players and for that, matches are crucial,” says Moktan.
Moktan primarily plays as the point guard. This is considered one of the most important positions in the sport as a point guard acts as a floor general. Understanding that she has been learning and trying to improve as she hopes to play many games for Nepal.
“I also play as a shooting guard but I love playing the point,” she says.
The two have played a match each for the national women’s team, albeit in different formats. Having debuted in their teens, they are eager to make the most of these opportunities and contribute to the team.
Building chemistry in the domestic scene
Rinchhen Moktan and Bina Mani Younjan
Both Moktan and Younjan are teammates in the domestic scene, initially playing for the Nepal Police Club. They have been consistently playing together on various teams. 
Their basketball journey began in school, with Younjan starting hers at Rupy’s International School, where she was introduced to the sport by Mabindra Chhetri, a member of the national men’s team.
Younjan was not comfortable when she started but with time and thanks to her teammates, she started to learn the game and get better. 
“I picked it up quite quickly. This is thanks to the senior members of my team,” she says.
Upon completing her Secondary Education Examination (SEE), Younjan joined Premier College and joined its basketball team. Currently, in the 12th grade, she and her team have won a tournament that featured both home and away formats.
However, Moktan’s road is different as she lived and breathed the sport since her early teens. Her love for basketball started when she was in grade 8. Her passion for basketball led her to join Trungram International Academy, where basketball was a major extra-curricular activity.
“I went to TIA for basketball. Then I heard that Anusha Malla and Shreya Khadka also play for TIA. There was a good environment for basketball,” Moktan says.  
Currently, Moktan, Younjan, Malla, and Khadka are teammates. Moktan played in the 3×3 basketball during the Asian Games under Khadka’s captaincy.
Since Moktan and Younjan have been playing together, the two have developed a chemistry. As Moktan runs the point, Younjan plays as a forward. They know when to cut in and when to hold back as the duo has been causing their opponents some major troubles.
“We have played together for various clubs, so there is proper coordination among us,” says Moktan. 
No I in ‘TEAM’
They understand how basketball is a team game and that they need to have each other’s back. Their bond is such that they try to cover for each other’s mistakes as well.
Both feel that the sport has changed the way they see life. It has improved their personal growth and even changed their lifestyle to some extent.
“It’s given us confidence and helped us build our character,” says Moktan.
As the game has given them a name, they hope they can work together in creating history for the country. The only way to do that is by winning medals.
“We dream big,” says Moktan.
Younjan believes if they can do that, they will be able to take Nepali women’s basketball to new heights.
Coach of national women’s basketball Bikash Shahi says it is possible too as he sees great potential in Moktan and Younjan.  
“They have what it takes to uplift the Nepali women’s basketball scene,” says Shahi.  
Moktan, who has played in 3×3 basketball, now wants to transition to full-court basketball for Nepal. However, both express concern about the irregularity of games, highlighting that consistent gameplay is essential for their development.
“We do not participate to lose. Although we can’t win, in every international match we learn something new,” says Younjan. “But for us to compete even harder, we need to play more games.”"

Sandeep Lamichhane’s stunning fall from grace
","Nepal cricket team’s former captain Sandeep Lamichhane, being released on bail on January 13, 2023. Photo: Aryan Dhimal
No other Nepali cricketer has achieved success like Sandeep Lamichhane. That said, no Nepali cricketer has been convicted of being a rapist either.
Kathmandu District Court, on Wednesday, handed Lamichhane an eight-year prison sentence for raping Gaushala 26 by taking advantage of her poor financial condition. 
The crime he committed not only branded him as a criminal but also cast a shadow over all his success and achievements. He was once dubbed the future of Nepali cricket. When he was selected to play in the Indian Premier League, many pinned him to take Nepali cricket to new heights. 
But now, after being convicted of rape, Lamichhane’s future in cricket is uncertain.
A humble beginning 
File: Sandeep Lamichhane
It was in 2015 when former national cricket coach Pubudu Dassanayake saw Sandeep Lamichhane, bowling in the nets at Kyampachaur, Chitwan. His bowling skills immediately caught Dassanayake’s attention as he called the then 14-year-old Lamichhane to join the U19 team.
It did not take time for him to get into the national team as he made his senior team debut against Namibia in the ICC World Cricket League Championship. There was no stopping him thereafter.
In 2018, Sandeep Lamichhane was selected by the Indian Premier League team Delhi Daredevils and played nine matches in two seasons. After becoming the first Nepali cricketer to play in IPL his fame rocketed globally too. Interest started coming in from other T20 leagues too as he took part in Big Bash League, Afghanistan Premier League, Caribbean Premier League and Pakistan Premier League to name a few.
He was at the top of the world. Many say he felt invincible. His attitude changed with the stardom he got. Being appointed the national team captain added fuel to the fire as his career and stardom as at the pinnacle.
Wrong turn 
Sandeep Lamichhane.
That stardom, however, was not to last as it seemed to have caught up to him.
On September 6, 2022, a girl, files a complaint against the then captain of the then Nepal national cricket team, Sandeep Lamichhane, accusing him of raping her in a Kathmandu Hotel on August 22. As the complaint was filed in Kathmandu, Lamichhane was in the Caribbean islands taking part in the Caribbean Premier League in the West Indies.  
The news created uproar all over the sports fraternity, globally. 
The girl, whom police and the court call Gaushala 26, reported to police, that on the eve of the Nepal cricket team’s Kenya departure on August 22, Sandeep Lamichhane asked her to go on a trip to Bhaktapur, and she agreed.
As it got late, Gaushala 26 could not go to her hostel as it shut its doors at 8 pm. She said, in the report, Lamichhane told her to stay with him for the night. That is when she said she was raped by Lamichhane who then flew to Kenya with the national cricket team the next day.
Two days after a  complaint was filed against Lamichhane on September 8 the Kathmandu District Court issued an arrest warrant against him.  On the same day, the Cricket Association of Nepal, a cricket governing body of Nepal, suspended Lamichhane from the team

After an arrest warrant was issued against Lamichhane as he was suspended by CAN, he left his CPL team. He pleaded innocence to charges put against him through his social media account.  However, despite this, Lamichhane did not come to Nepal. He went missing in action. That led to the Department of Immigration blacklisting Lamichhane on September 21 so the police could arrest him as soon as he landed.
Seventeen days had passed since the issuance of an arrest warrant against him, yet he remained inaccessible. However, on September 25, he announced through a social media post that he was taking some time off to stay alone to cope with stress but assured his return to address the case. Thereon, on September 26, Nepal Police issued a diffusion notice to all Interpol members, seeking assistance in arresting him.
Day of arrest

On October 6, a month after the issuance of an arrest warrant against him, Lamichhane returned to Nepal and was arrested. 
Despite his earlier statement expressing his intention to surrender, he was arrested as soon as he landed at the Tribhuvan International Airport.
99 days in custody

Lamichhane then spent 99 days in custody after the Kathmandu District Court permitted Nepal Police to detain him as they investigated the case. 
On October 31, the government attorney’s office filed a lawsuit, demanding a jail sentence of 10 to 12 years, against Sandeep Lamichhane. And on November 4 Lamichhane was sent to judicial custody until the final verdict. 
Bailed out

Surprisingly, on January 12, 2023, the Patan High Court, however, ordered his release on a bail of Rs 2 million.
A division bench of Dhruva Raj Nanda and Ramesh Dhakal heard Lamichhane’s appeal for release and decided to let him fight the legal battle staying out of jail. Despite releasing Lamichhane, the court restricted him from going abroad until the final verdict.
Back in the business

His release on bail then prompted CAN to lift its suspension on January 31 allowing him to play cricket for Nepal. Two days after the CAN lifted his suspension, on February 2, Lamichhane was in camp.
The return of Lamichhane to the close camp of the national team received flak from various people. Many protested how an accused rapist could be part of the national team. Many went to the streets demanding he be removed but that did not happen as he was even selected for the team which was playing the last leg of the Cricket World Cup League 2.
Despite that, he played the series against Namibia and Scotland. The Scottish players, in solidarity with the survivor, chose not to shake hands with Lamichhane in both games.
He even went to the UAE to take on Papua New Guinea and the UAE after the court granted him special privileges.
After he received his bail, he took part in 20 ODIs and eight T20Is. Noteworthy among these are matches in prestigious events such as the Asian Games and Asia Cup along with three League 2 series, ODI World Cup Qualifiers, and T20 World Cup Qualifiers.
Found guilty 
However, after 15 months of legal battle, Lamichhane was convicted of rape. The bench, presided over by Judge Shishir Raj Dhakal, has deemed Lamichhane guilty of raping Gaushala 26. The court mandated a separate hearing to determine the duration of imprisonment. 
Even though Lamichhane was accused of raping a minor, the court dismissed the claim that the girl was a minor when the incident happened. 
Sentenced to prison
The District Court, on January 10 sentenced Sandeep Lamichhane to eight years of prison and ordered him to pay compensation of Rs 200,000 to the survivor.  According to the court, Lamichhane raped the survivor taking advantage of her poor financial condition. 
Despite the conviction, Lamichhane will not face immediate arrest. He has the option to appeal the district court’s decision first at the High Court and, ultimately, at the Supreme Court.
The court determined that Lamichhane had violated Section 219 (1, 2, and 3) (e) of the Civil Code 2017, as the act was non-consensual.
Suspended from playing cricket
The verdict from the court then prompted the Cricket Association of Nepal to suspend Lamichhane from all forms of cricket. The statement, issued on January 11, said Lamichhane was suspended from playing cricket indefinitely.
Letter to CAN 
Reportedly, Lamichhane has also written a letter to CAN stating that he will not be part of the cricket team until proven innocent. In that letter, he has also requested CAN to release his pending payments as he says he is in a serious financial crisis."

Decisions to give 20 per cent of matchday ticket sales to players missing from ANFA minute
","File photo
Kathmandu, January 4
The All Nepal Football Association (ANFA) decision to give 20 per cent of the money collected from matchday tickets to the players has disappeared from its minute.
The central working committee meeting of ANFA, held on December 18, 2023, decided to stop the distribution of free passes during international games and to provide 20 per cent of the amount raised from ticket sales to the players.
The minutes of the decision from that meeting were forwarded by Kiran Rai, the General Secretary of ANFA, to the senior vice president, vice president, central members, and office bearers on January 1. However, the decision taken on December 18 is absent from it.
According to the statute of ANFA, minutes must be sent in writing to the members of the working committee within 15 days of the meeting. Accordingly, in the 17-point minute sent by Kiran Rai to the members of the working committee on Tuesday, the decision made by the working committee regarding proceeds from the matchday ticket being given to players has been removed.
The central members of ANFA have raised objections to this situation. They contend that the response received indicates that the minutes included discussions not addressed in the working committee meeting, while crucially omitting the matters that were decided upon.
However, ANFA spokesperson Suresh Shah has offered a different explanation, stating that the omission was the result of a typing mistake. According to Shah, the decision was not intentionally removed but was overlooked due to a typing error. Subsequently, the error was rectified, and the corrected minutes were resent."

Bishal Shrestha hangs up gloves after silent dedication on the sidelines
","Bishal Shrestha celebrates as Nepal equalise against India on September 5, 2021.
“I am emotional but happy. You have done a lot and achieved a lot. You are an inspiration for many including me. I am always proud of you. Your fan forever.” 
Bidhya Shrestha, the sister of Bishal Shrestha, posted this on her social media after he announced his retirement from international football on December 22 during the post-match conference after a match between FC Chitwan and Jhapa FC during the Nepal Super League 2023.
Since then, the goalkeeper has been receiving an outpouring of messages and wishes from family, friends, and fans. He had never anticipated that his retirement would generate such a buzz within the football fraternity and media. 
Bishal Shrestha, who had informally retired after not playing a single game during the 2023 SAFF Championship, decided to formally announce it during the post-match conference which took many by surprise.
“Everything has a perfect time and I thought that day was perfect to announce retirement,” says Shrestha.
Playing the waiting game
Bishal Shrestha dives towards the ball during a Nepal Super League match.
Bishal Shrestha has been part of the national football since 2011 but the 31-year-old has hardly played. His only appearance for the national team came in 2021 when he came on as a substitute in the 85th minute against India replacing captain Kiran Kumar Limbu. Despite it being a brief cameo, he fondly reminisces about that match as the highlight of his footballing career.
“Every boy dreams of playing for the national team and I will forever be thankful to Abdullah Almutairi for sending me in despite Nepal losing 2-0 to India. Those 10 minutes will be with me forever,” says Shrestha.
Bishal Shrestha hoped that after that game, more opportunities would come his way, but unfortunately, that has not been the case as he has not played a minute for Nepal since. Recognising the challenges faced by backup goalkeepers, he acknowledges that second-choice goalkeepers often receive fewer chances, and he is no exception to this reality.
“Being a goalkeeper is tough in the world of football. If there is one goalkeeper better than us, that’s game over for us most times,” says Shrestha.
The course of events could have taken a different turn if Bishal Shrestha had not been injured in 2012. Given that most first-choice goalkeepers were injured during the Nehru Cup in India, there was a significant chance that he could have played. However, the injury delayed his journey to the national team by a year or two.
“It is what it is. Luck also plays an important role,” he says.
Consistently being second or third in line was demotivating for him. However, his love for the game and his patience acted as enduring sources of motivation, enabling him to stay with the national team and remain hopeful. Furthermore, he received significant support from his family members.
“I am happy with whatever I have been able to do for the national team,” says Shrestha.     
Bishal Shrestha, who nurtured dreams of representing the national team since childhood, looks back at his time with the national squad as a moment filled with pride and happiness. Reflecting on his experiences, he shares a deep connection with the national team.
“I will miss every aspect—the camaraderie in the dressing room, the journeys with teammates, and the intensity of matches,” says Shrestha.
A-Division Legend
Bishal Shrestha Photo: Chandra Bahadur Ale 
Despite not having the opportunity to play many games for the national team, Bishal Shrestha has been impressive in the A Division League.
In the Martyr’s Memorial A Division League in 2022, he achieved an impressive record of keeping 11 clean sheets, going over a thousand minutes without conceding a goal. In recognition of his outstanding performance, he was named the best goalkeeper of the league that year as he conceded only two goals in 13 matches. 
He played a crucial role in Machhindra Football Club winning a title without losing a single game. In the 2020 season, he also had an outstanding performance, losing only one game as Machhindra secured another league title.
In total, Bishal Shrestha has clinched four league titles, securing two with Manang Marshyangdi Club and two with Machhindra Football Club since his debut in the A Division League in 2009.
Similarly, Shrestha has also participated in both editions of the Nepal Super League. In the first edition, he played for Butwal-Lumbini Football Club, and in the second edition, he was captain and the marquee player for Football Club Chitwan.
During the conversation with Onlinekhabar, Shrestha also highlighted the significance of goalkeepers in football. He pointed out that people often do not credit goalkeepers for victories, but they play a crucial role, handling 50 per cent of the game.
“Goalie is a captain without an armband,” he says. “It is a fun and difficult position in football.” 
Even though Shrestha is no longer part of the national team, he remains equally concerned about the state of Nepali football as he was before.
He is worried as footballers continue to leave the country and has said he will stay in Nepal and try to contribute to football in whatever way possible.
“I hope football gets more priority so that this exodus stops and I too can continue playing the sport I love,” says Shrestha.
To improve the sport, Shrestha urges the All Nepal Football Association (ANFA) to establish a proper calendar for the leagues and strive to host games regularly.
“Players will only feel secure staying in the country if there are more games scheduled, providing them with consistent opportunities,” he says."

Dhangadhi FC have booked a place in the final of the Nepal Super League 2023 by beating Pokhara Thunders on penalties on Monday.
In a tightly contested match between the two in Qualifier 1 of the Nepal Super League 2023, Dhangadhi narrowly edged out Pokhara 4-3 on penalties.
The game started with Pokhara Thunders taking an early lead thanks to Ayush Ghalan. Despite dominating the game, the Thunders could not score another goal as Dhangadhi’s keeper, Mohamad Taha made some good saves to keep Dhangadhi in the game who looked off pace in the first half.
The second half, however, was a different story as Dhangadhi started well scoring in the 54th minute to equalise. Despite many chances for both teams, the game ended up going to extra time.



The extra time was a cagy affair with both teams looking gassed after a frantic 90 minutes. Stephan Kojo, however, took advantage of some poor defending to give Pokhara the lead in the 103rd minute.
Things looked bleak for Dhangadhi but a last-minute goal from Ahmed Hijazi sent the game to penalties which they won 4-3.
Pokhara Thunders have another chance to reach the final if they beat the winners of the eliminator between Kathmandu Rayzrs and Lalitpur City FC."

Nepal Super League 2023 sees four teams lock horns in battle for championship glory
","The league stage of the Nepal Super League 2023 proved to be a captivating spectacle, marked by a blend of drama, excitement, intense competition among players, and a series of unexpected results.
Nepal’s only franchise football league, which started a month ago, witnessed 36 thrilling league matches between nine teams. 
Following a series of gruelling and dramatic matches, Pokhara Thunders, Dhangadhi FC, Kathmandu Rayzrs, and Lalitpur City FC will compete against each other in the playoffs to be crowned Nepal Super League champions.
While Dhangadi, Kathmandu and Lalitpur have all been here before during the first edition of the Nepal Super League, table toppers Pokhara will be taking part in their first as they bid to win the championship with their young team.
Standing in their way, however, will be Dhangadi who finished runners-up in the first edition of Nepal Super League held in 2021. Kathmandu, who are the defending champions, will also prove to be a tough test along with Lalitpur who would want to better their third-place finish in the first edition.
Pokhara, who narrowly missed the playoffs in 2021 due to goal difference, have clinched the top spot in the standings for the current season. They secured 15 points from eight games, boasting a record of four wins, three draws, and one loss. Dhangadhi claimed the second position with 13 points earned with three wins, four draws, and one loss. Kathmandu finished third accumulating 12 points with three wins, three draws, and two losses. Despite losing two in a row, Lalitpur finished the fourth with 10 points with two wins, four draws and two losses.
Lalitpur, however, can consider themselves fortunate as they finished with the same number of points as Jhapa FC and Butwal Lumbini. However, Lalitpur managed to secure a spot in the playoffs by a superior goal difference.
4 teams 1 cup

The playoffs will consist of four games, including the final. The first qualifier, scheduled for Monday, will feature a face-off between the top two teams, Pokhara and Dhangadhi. The winner of this match will secure a direct spot in the final while the losing team will still have another opportunity to reach the final in the next qualifier.
In their recent league stage encounter, Pokhara and Dhangadhi battled to a draw, with Pokhara scoring a last-minute goal to equalize after Dhangadhi initially took the lead.
Tuesday will see Kathmandu take on Lalitpur in the eliminator. If the last game between them is anything to go by, this valley derby where the loser will go home will likely see a record crowd for an NSL match.
The winner of this match will then face the loser of Pokhara and Dhangadi on Thursday to book a ticket to the final of the Nepal Super League 2023 on Saturday. All matches during the playoff will start at 5.30 pm. 
The winner of the Nepal Super League 2023 will receive a cash prize of Rs 7.5 million."

Nepal Super League: Drama expected in the last 4 matches of the league stage
","Kathmandu, December 22
The Nepal Super League 2023 is gaining momentum with each passing game. Recent match outcomes have intensified the excitement, particularly as teams vie for the top four playoff spots.
In the ongoing nine-team tournament, 32 out of 36 league stage matches have been played, leaving only two playoff berths up for grabs. With only four league games left, the four teams advancing to the playoffs in the Nepal Super League will be determined on Saturday evening.
So far, Pokhara Thunders and Dhangadhi FC have already secured their spots in the playoffs, while four teams, Jhapa FC, Lalitpur FC, Kathmandu Razyrs and Birgunj United, are competing for the remaining two positions.
Sporting Ilam FC, Butwal Lumbini FC, and FC Chitwan have been officially eliminated from the playoff contention.
Dramatic week

This week’s Nepal Super League games produced surprising results, with title-contending teams facing unexpected losses. The excitement kicked off with a 1-1 draw between defending champions Kathmandu Rayzrs and former runners-up Dhangadhi FC on Monday. 
On Tuesday, Sporting Ilam, who were out of the playoff contention, beat Lalitpur City FC 1-0 ending their unbeaten run in Nepal Super League 2023. A win against Ilam would have taken Lalitpur to the playoffs but now have a tough match against Kathmandu in the city derby.
On Wednesday, Jhapa injected more drama into the league by securing a 2-0 victory over Dhangadhi FC. Jhapa, who were reduced to 10 men, blew the table wide open with this win thanks to a talismanic performance from captain Anjan Bista.
On Thursday more fuel was added to the fire after Birgunj United came from behind to beat defending champions Kathmandu Rayzrs 4-1. Kathmandu were all but set to get to the playoffs, but Ghanaian William Opoku had other ideas as he scored an impressive hat trick, including two in two minutes, to take the game away from the defending champions. This win has given Birgunj a great chance to qualify for the playoffs.
The recent defeat could prove costly for Kathmandu, forcing them to win their last league match against Lalitpur to stay in the race for defending the title. It sets the stage for a do-or-die situation for Kathmandu.
Kathmandu’s head coach, Bal Gopal Maharjan, acknowledged the team’s subpar performance, saying, “This is the biggest loss in my coaching career. I have never experienced anything like this.”
The Nepal Super League has become increasingly thrilling as title contenders have suffered consecutive losses, adding an extra layer of excitement to the league.
The tables have turned

As of now, only Pokhara Thunders have secured a place in the playoffs and are poised to finish in the top two, especially considering recent setbacks for Kathmandu and Lalitpur. Finishing first or second will be crucial for Pokhara, providing them with two chances to reach the final scheduled for December 30.
Pokhara Thunders are on the top of the table with 14 points from seven games. Their final league match is against Dhangadhi FC on Friday. Former runners-up, Dhangadhi FC, are currently in second position with 12 points.
Their match will determine who finishes top. A draw would be sufficient for Pokhara to maintain the top spot. Alternatively, Dhangadhi can secure the top position by defeating Pokhara, setting the stage for the first qualifier between the two teams.
Lalitpur City FC and Jhapa FC currently hold the third and fourth positions in the league standings with 10 points each. Former champions Kathmandu Ragers are in fifth place with nine points from seven games. Birgunj, after beating Kathmandu, holds the sixth position with eight points, keeping their chances of securing a top-four spot alive.
On Friday, Jhapa FC will face FC Chitwan in a crucial match where a victory would almost certainly secure their place in the eliminator. Simultaneously, Birgunj United, in their match against Butwal Lumbini, will be seeking a win to propel them into the playoffs. The final match featuring Kathmandu against Lalitpur is anticipated to be intense, as it is a must-win game for Kathmandu if they harbour any aspirations of clinching a playoff berth."

In 2023, Barbie named Women in Sports as their career of the year.
Whenever I am out and about socially, there is always someone who seems pretty certain about not considering my profession as mainstream. Hold up! Sports as a career? In Nepal? You bet! This article aims to explain why women in this male-dominant sports industry in Nepal should not be viewed as a surprise.
I have been part of the Nepali cricket industry in a private capacity for quite a while now. Armed with a Master’s Degree in IT from an American University, my choice to stick with sports management tends to raise eyebrows. While I am not an on-field player, I am definitely behind the scenes, playing strong games of serious deliverance with my team. We are all about creating what is not there.
As untouched and less discussed as the sports management industry is in Nepal, it has ample room to showcase creativity. Being a commanding woman in a position can be challenging, but on the brighter side, the gender advantage has yet to fail me. As alien as I might be in sports management in Nepal, I have been accepted with open arms. The nature of the job is highly competitive, no doubt.

Women in sports are safe, heard, and welcomed. I absolutely relish the addition of spirited women to the team. The nuances of sports are something women complement greatly. Sports management inherently rejects narrow minds. There is a lot of travelling, meeting people, experimenting, and remembering limitations. The adjustments are both trivial and clever. 
Often, in our part of the world, societal norms limit women from making career decisions, hindering them from living life on their terms. This restriction potentially keeps many capable women from pursuing the sports industry, where they could truly wield their power to make an impact. Change is gradual, and I hope to see numerous female faces in charge of stadiums someday in Nepal.
Yes, there are challenges. It ranges from personal sacrifices to job security and opportunities. However, these are workable factors for any freelancer in sports management. The key is excelling at our jobs to thrive anywhere. 
Taking a page from the medical field, the seriousness we apply there should not differ in sports management. Sports is a powerful industry. Children grow up idolising what we showcase on TV. As glorious as the game is, it is every child’s dream to represent their country someday. Carrying that responsibility is our role in sports—an often thankless yet deeply satisfying job.
Nepali sports industry
The fans went wild at TU Cricket Ground after Nepal beat UAE.
Sports may be a smaller industry in Nepal, but globally, it is a behemoth. The world economy has shifted, and it is time we alter our perspective to recognise the potential of sports as an industry in Nepal. The idea of open commercialisation of sports remains somewhat unexplored, as it continues to be a more exclusive affair in Nepal. 
By sourcing innovative ideas, there’s a wealth of public attention and investment waiting to be tapped into, along with numerous practices to establish and discard. As the Nepali team achieves international records, the packaging of the sport becomes everything. There is plenty to learn from international sports management to make our industry highly marketable and poised for global entry.
Sports such as cricket, football, volleyball, or even golf serve as key intersections for reshaping Nepal’s global narrative. Over the years, Kabaddi has witnessed a substantial surge in India, both in terms of viewership and commercial success. The primary challenge we grapple with is Nepal’s comparatively small market size, posing constraints on our ability to generate substantial economic gains. Therefore, there is unanimous agreement on the imperative for Nepal’s sports to venture onto the international stage.
Nepal boasts many hardworking individuals, yet achieving this goal demands specialised talents in sports management with the requisite experience and the capacity to enhance existing values. In the long run, outsourcing such talents may foster dependence. Hence, a concerted effort is needed to inspire Nepali youth to engage in sports management, contributing to our sports ecosystem. 
There are various ways in which we can harness the potential of sports for our benefit. Encouraging youth involvement can be instrumental in capitalising on the multifaceted opportunities presented by the sports industry. There is a lot to explore if you think about it."

Women in sports management can make a difference 
","Painting ‘My Private Life’ by artist Priyam Pradhan at the exhibition Mani at Siddhartha Art Gallery, Baber Mahal. Photo: Chandra Bahadur Ale
Using Pitt’s artist pen on paper, artist Priyam Pradhan presents My Private Life, a showcase of the current significance of his life depicted in abstract form.
At the centre of the painting is a 1000-rupee note, within which Pradhan has intricately painted Lord Krishna, a man wearing a hoodie tenderly embracing his dog, and a woman. The woman stands tall, elongated in form. Towards the bottom of the canvas, a holy man reaches out his hands, appearing to be in flight.
Priyam Pradhan has used a vibrant colour palette, incorporating bright hues such as pink, orange, and yellow, as well as green, black, white, and grey. This combination adds a dynamic and lively quality to the artwork.
“The man in the centre is me and the girl in green is my girlfriend. And the faces are my mom and dad,” says Pradhan. “The sadhu (holy man) symbolises my desires that I don’t have many desires for materialistic things however I do understand the value of money.”
The use of colours, figures and lines in an abstract form in his painting resembles the painting of American painter Paul Jackson Pollock. Like his abstract expressionism, Pradhan has expressed himself in his painting.
Furthermore, this marks Priyam Pradhan’s third solo painting exhibition titled Mani (money), inaugurated on January 17 at Siddhartha Art Gallery, Baber Mahal.
In his previous exhibitions, Pradhan’s artworks centred around Hindu philosophy and his spontaneous thought process. However, in this latest exhibition, he explores the theme of money and its impact on an individual’s life, delving into the reverberating effects of financial aspects.
Understanding the value of money

Any form of art is known as a reflection of the contemporary time. Likewise, Priyam Pradhan’s paintings reflect the lifestyle, desires, obligations and more of today’s younger generation living in urban areas in Nepal.
Pradhan himself is in his 20s and he has justified the want of most of the youngsters in their 20s, who might be declared adults and understand the need for money and materialistic things but are still kids at their heart who want to explore and experience life as much as possible.
The exhibition has 27 paintings which Pradhan took around nine months to complete. According to him, while he was travelling the idea that his life was luxurious and him being capable of exploring anything he wanted to was because of money.
And being an artist this concept lingered on him and he was compelled to create on the theme of money.
Once you enter the gallery, you can also view an animated video, which introduces artist Pradhan and the importance of money, which is on the ground floor. On the first floor, a huge painting (193×62 in cm) Apatkalin Awastha using mixed media on canvas welcomes you and other paintings are small in size (18×30 in cm).
“It is a team work and it is my introduction as an artist for the exhibition,” he says. “Also, being a recent multimedia graduate from Islington College, I wanted to explore my skills and I got my team. Then, like money, multimedia is relevant to current society.”
Experiencing life through art
Painting by artist Priyam Pradhan at Siddhartha Art Gallery, Baber Mahal. Photo: Chandra Bahadur Ale 
Priyam Pradhan says enjoyment is the meaning of life and he enjoys creating artwork. Moreover, Pradhan who came into the art world first being a tattoo artist feels blessed that he has the privilege to explore whatever he likes in his life.
He also believes that the philosophy that says one should not be materialistic is wrong. “If material things are not important, why would one build a house? And after building a house why do they want to decorate their house?” he questions.
Alongside, money and materialistic things, his paintings also explore love, romance, life and childhood experiences. Motifs like Pokemon, ramen noodles, animals, dancers, etc have been used in his paintings. In most of his paintings, he has used numerous white lines in wavy form and these lines for Pradhan indicate the sound or the energy that exists in the surroundings all the time.
About using a pitta artist pen, he says, “I have enjoyed drawing and painting since my childhood and using a pitta artist pen helps me revisit that feeling of happiness and sense of freedom.”
So many things happening on the canvas with the use of vibrant colours gives a sense of excitement to the viewers. Though referencing artists like Pollock, MF Husain, Picasso and more, his pen strokes give a sense of newness through his expression and thoughts about his life experiences.
In his paintings, these bright colours and motifs are in harmony and are visual treats that can surely cheer up the mood of any visitor. Moreover, you can also get free stickers from the artist.
If you too are in a gloomy mood and want to uplift a little, visit the exhibition that continues till February 6."

","Entrepreneurship education is not just an investment in the education system; it is an investment in the nation’s future prosperity. Photo: Pexels/ Rodnae Productions
In the shadow of the towering Himalayas, Nepal faces a challenge that rivals the steepness of its mountainous terrain- the challenge of economic development. As the nation earnestly pursues its Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), it becomes increasingly evident that a transformation in the education system is not only necessary but also urgent. 
Rooted in common living strategies, the prevailing education model, especially in higher education, may not adequately prepare the youth for the demands of the modern world. 
In this critical juncture, the incorporation of entrepreneurship education emerges as a beacon of hope, offering a pathway towards a self-reliant and prosperous Nepal.
Time to reevaluate the education system
Nepal’s journey towards economic prosperity has been marked by challenges that demand innovative solutions. The commitment of the SDGs reflects not only a global responsibility but also a domestic imperative for sustainable development. For this, it is high time to reevaluate the education system in the country.
The current education system in Nepal, deeply entrenched in common living strategies, has been the foundation of learning for generations. However, in the face of a rapidly evolving world, today’s generation aspires for more than the status quo. The call for independence reverberates through the aspirations of youth who seek a curriculum fostering critical thinking, innovation and entrepreneurial skills.
Entrepreneurship education is a dynamic force capable of reshaping Nepal’s educational landscape. This innovative approach moves beyond traditional learning methods, providing students with the tools to navigate the complexities of the modern world. At its core, entrepreneurship education is about empowering students to implement learned information in practical and tangible ways.
Consider a student engrossed in the intricacies of sensor systems during a science class, entrepreneurship education transforms this theoretical knowledge into practical applications, inspiring the creation of a sensor-operated door. Such innovation born from a fusion of science and entrepreneurship becomes a valuable mindset in solving practical problems.  
Expanding the horizons of entrepreneurship education, let us delve into chemistry. Imagine students studying chemistry not just as a theoretical subject, but also as entrepreneurs in the making. Armed with entrepreneurial principles, these students can tap into Nepal’s rich biodiversity, exploring market demands for products derived from local plants.
In the scenario, chemistry students could embark on a journey to develop performance-enhancing products based on market demand, harnessing the potential of indigenous flora. What makes this approach remarkable is that it does not necessarily require sophisticated machines or extensive human resources. Instead, it leverages the inherent skills and awareness of individuals within the community, paving the way for a grassroots economic revolution.
Entrepreneurship in education

The beauty of entrepreneurship education lies in its universal applicability. It is not confined to science or chemistry alone. Consider an art student, for example. Through entrepreneurship education, they can understand what art to develop (product), how much to set the price (price), where to sell (place) and how to sell (promote) their artworks. Every subject becomes a canvas for innovation and enterprise.
Moreover, entrepreneurship education is a powerful equaliser, recognising the unique skills and talents of individuals across various disciplines. It is not about fitting into a predefined mould but rather about unleashing the potential within each student. When every single person is aware of their skills and potential, they can rise to different levels, contributing to the overall progress of the nation.
Entrepreneurship education goes beyond skill recognition; it is about nurturing the ability to produce goods and mastering the art of marketing. Returning to the example of the student developing a sensor-operated door, entrepreneurship education not only equips them to produce the product but also teaches them how to navigate the complexities of marketing it to potential users and clients.
The impact of entrepreneurship education extends beyond individual success stories; it reverberates through the entire nation. A generation equipped with entrepreneurial skills becomes a driving force for economic growth and independence. They will be able to recognise the resources and ideas to utilise them to reach the global market. They will be able to be the pioneers in products and contribute to the economy. By fostering a culture of innovation, creativity and self-reliance, Nepal can reduce its dependence on external sources and strengthen its economy from within.
In essence, entrepreneurship education is not just an investment in the education system; it is an investment in the nation’s future prosperity. It is a transformative force that has the potential to shape a generation of independent thinkers, innovators and entrepreneurs- the architects of a self-reliant and economically vibrant Nepal. Entrepreneurship education, by teaching students to utilise available resources (physical and financial) and make them commercial, becomes a cornerstone in the nation’s journey towards economic empowerment and independence."

","Ram Bujhaun Yadav with his land ownership certificate stands near a border pillar which he says was erroneously placed on his land. 
In October 2023, when 51-year-old Ram Bujhaun Yadav of Musaharnia Rural Municipality-5, Mukhiyapatti, Dhanusha, was at a relative’s house, someone told him that two Indian Sashastra Seema Bal (SSB) personnel were looking for him.
Anxious, he rushed home wondering why they were looking for him.
“They asked me if the paddy field in the no man’s land was mine. I told them yes and they asked me to cut down the paddy immediately,” he said.
The paddy was not ripe and Yadav asked them for some time. However, the SSB personnel told him he had to cut down his paddy immediately.
Ram Bujhaun and his wife Tetari Devi each own a 677-square-metre plot of land. As Nepal and India reevaluated the border, Ram Bujhan’s land was been deemed to be near the no man’s land as it now has two demarcation pillars.
Frustrated, Ram Bujhaun cut the paddy before it was due to be harvested. Now, he has been asked to not plant anything on the land as it falls in the no man’s land.
“Our border police don’t say a word. I can’t fight the SSB on my own,” says Ram Bujhaun adding he had decided not to plan anything on the land anymore.
Woes of the farmers
Many farmers in southern Nepal say their land has now been placed in India after the recent demarcation. 
When the Jamuna River, which flows through the no man’s land between Nepal and India, changed its course some two decades ago, some border pillars went missing. Locals say these pillars have now been placed encroaching on Nepali land.
In 2018, with the then Chief District Officer of Dhanusha, Pradeep Raj Kandel, and an official from Madhubani district, Bihar, India, a team that included border security forces from both countries, the Armed Police Force of Nepal, and SSB of India began placing border pillars after land measurement by technicians.
Locals have raised concerns, stating that border pillars have been positioned, encroaching approximately 50 to 100 meters of land into Nepal compared to the previous position. Many like Ram Bujhaun are unaware of when these border pillars were placed.
“I did not know that pillar was placed here. After I found out when I asked the village leaders, many said they were placing the border pillars as they pleased,” said Ram Bujhaun.
He was told to carry on planting paddy and that it would not matter as these issues had happened in the past. 
“They encroached on my land and have asked me not to plant anything. This is gross injustice,” he says.
Ram Bujhaun’s family owns a total of 4,000 square metres of land, with 2,000 square metres belonging to him and the remaining 2,000 square metres to his brother Bechan. However, 1,000 square metres of his land is now located on the Indian side after the demarcation. Despite this, he has been farming on the land and continues to pay taxes to the Department of Land Management and Archive in Nepal.
“They have marked my land to be on the Indian side and placed border pillars on it. I’ve been farming till now but I don’t know when they will ask me to stop,” he says.
Ignorance of the government
The Madhesh province in southern Nepal
The former ward chair of Mukhiyapatti Musharniya Rural Municipality-5, Ram Naresh Yadav, said that over time, India has encroached on numerous Nepali lands in various locations in the Madhesh Province. This, he says, happened due to the Nepali administration’s ignorance and weak stature.
“They (Nepali administration) were careless and that meant the Indian side placed these border pillars by encroaching on Nepali land,” says Ram Naresh.
He said that over 40 farmers from wards 1, 5, and 6 have land ranging from 300 to 1,600 square metres on the Indian side. 
“These farmers have land ownership certificates, but they cannot farm as the SSB says the land is in India and not Nepal,” said Ram Naresh.
In 1996, land ownership certificates were distributed after surveying the land in the border area. Local Dharmendra Kumar Yadav said that since then, the locals have been paying their land tax regularly. In 2018, when the pillar was being placed, the locals protested when they saw their land was being encroached on. However, since the demarcation had been agreed upon by high-ranking government officials of Nepal and India, the farmer’s voices went unheard.
“We tried to stop when the border pillars were being placed on our land. But the administrators from both sides forcibly put it there without even trying to hold a discussion,” said Harish Chandra Yadav. 
The Chief District Officer of Dhanusha, Chakrapani Pandey, says that the border pillars were placed by the technical team after the measurements and with the agreement of the high-ranking officials of the two countries.
“The fields and houses that are built in no man’s land have recently been cleared. No one can do anything in this particular area,” said Pandey. “We understand the people’s concern but we cannot do anything about it now.”"

","Regenerative braking representational image. Photo: Freepik
The electric vehicle market in Nepal has grown significantly over the past year. 
Electric four-wheelers and two-wheelers are being launched almost every month, spanning from passenger to commercial vehicles. Electric transportation appears to be an emerging trend in the automotive industry.
New EVs are regularly introduced with advanced features as car companies develop unique electric platforms. One standout feature is regenerative braking.
Regenerative braking was first introduced in 1967 by the American Motor Car Company (AMC) in their prototype electric vehicle, the AMC Amitron. However, Toyota became the automobile manufacturer to implement regenerative braking system (RBS) technology in their Prius series hybrid vehicles in 1997. Toyota brought up the new hybrid technology in the Prius when fuel prices were going up at a massive rate.

But what is regenerative braking? There are still many people confused about what it is, whether it is safe or helpful in fuel economy in hybrid cars and the regeneration of electricity in electric cars.
In simple terms, regen braking is when a car saves energy by recharging its battery when you brake, helping it use less fuel or electricity and go further. Easy but scientifically, regen braking is a process used in vehicles where the kinetic energy produced during braking is converted into electrical energy through an electric motor acting as a generator. This electrical energy is then stored in the vehicle’s battery for later use, reducing energy wastage and increasing overall efficiency.

Regen braking can be seen in all kinds of EVs, including cars, scooters, commercial vans, buses, bicycles, three-wheelers, and rickshaws. It now can be electrically managed to what extent the power and braking can be generated. 
Regenerative Braking work process in EV

Principle of Operation: Regene braking works by turning the energy from slowing down into electricity.
Electric Motor as a Generator: In EV or hybrid cars with regen braking, the motor changes roles from moving the car to making electricity when you brake.
Switching Polarity: When you brake, the motor switches directions, turning energy from the wheels into electricity instead of using it to move the car.
Generation of Electricity: The turning wheels make the motor produce electricity, which goes to the car’s battery.
Power Electronics: Special electronics change the electricity from the motor into the right kind for charging the battery.
Battery Charging: The electricity made during braking charges up the car’s battery, storing the energy for later.
Integration with Hydraulic Braking System: Regenerative braking works with the regular brakes, blending them for smooth stopping.

Advantages and Disadvantages of Regenerative Braking 
The advantages are listed below:

Energy Efficiency: Regenerative braking efficiently captures the kinetic energy generated during braking, effectively reducing energy wastage and contributing to a more sustainable driving experience.
Extended Range: By using the energy that would otherwise be lost during braking as heat and sound, regenerative braking helps to extend the driving range of electric vehicles in instances such as travelling downhill. 
Reduced Brake Wear: Regenerative braking minimizes the strain on traditional braking components, mitigating wear and tear, and potentially extending the lifespan of the braking components such as brake pads, rotors and brake lines, thus reducing maintenance costs over time.
Enhanced Driving Experience: Regenerative braking provides a smoother braking experience and a more responsive feel to drivers, enhancing overall driving comfort and control on the road.

The disadvantages are listed below:

Limited Effectiveness at Low Speeds: While regenerative braking efficiently recaptures energy during braking, its effectiveness diminishes at lower speeds which leads to decreased energy recovery compared to higher speeds.
Complexity and Cost: Implementing regenerative braking adds complexity and cost to vehicle systems, potentially raising manufacturing and maintenance expenses, and impacting consumer affordability.
Maintenance Requirements: Regenerative braking systems require periodic maintenance and calibration to ensure they operate optimally.
Efficiency Variability: Regenerative braking may exhibit variability in efficiency under extreme weather conditions or on certain road surfaces, leading to fluctuations in overall energy recapture and impacting the vehicle’s efficiency.

Misconceptions

Fully Recharges Battery: Some mistakenly believe that regenerative braking fully replenishes the battery, but in reality, it only adds a modest amount of charge.
Increases Braking Distances: There is a misconception that regenerative braking extends braking distances, but it enhances braking performance by complementing traditional brakes.
High-Speed Only: While more effective at higher speeds, regenerative braking still functions at lower speeds, such as during city driving or stop-and-go traffic.
Maintenance-Free: Despite requiring less maintenance than traditional brakes, regen braking systems still need periodic checks and maintenance to ensure proper operation.
Significantly Boosts Range: While regen braking contributes to extending the driving range of electric vehicles, its impact is influenced by various factors beyond just braking efficiency.
Only for Electric Cars: Although commonly associated with electric vehicles, regen braking systems are also found in some conventional vehicles, particularly those aiming to improve fuel efficiency with advanced technology.

Regenerative braking might sound complicated, but it is pretty cool. Think of it as a way for EVs and hybrids to recycle energy when they slow down. Instead of just wasting that energy, regenerative braking turns it into electricity, which can then be used to power the battery."

“Please don’t come close to the animal,” the zoo’s vet, Radha Krishna Gharti, told approaching photojournalists. But in the gush of excitement to take exclusive photographs of the elusive cat, difficult to spot even in its prime habitats, there were few takers for the word of caution.
Nepal’s Department of National Parks and Wildlife Conservation (DNPWC) organised the photo-op two days after the male subadult cat, which was until recently found in the country only at altitudes higher than 2,000-6,000 metres above sea level, was brought to the zoo from Urlabari town(146 m above sea level). According to the department, the animal has sustained injuries to its right foreleg and cannot stand upright.
Although officials involved said they are looking at releasing the animal into the wild after it recuperates, doing so will be a daunting task, adding that the zoo may be the only place where it can now survive.

“Nepali snow leopard experts have come up with two hypotheses to explain how the animal from the mountains landed up in the plains,” said Sharad Chandra Adhikari, member-secretary at the National Trust for Nature Conservation (NTNC), a semi-government body that manages the zoo in Lalitpur, a town in the Kathmandu Valley. 
The first of the two hypotheses made public during the photo-op-cum-press conference, is that it was raised in captivity and somehow managed to escape into the wild. The second is that it lost its orientation while trying to establish its territory after separating from its mother.
Kulbhushansingh Suryawanshi, director of the India program, Snow Leopard Trust, said that both hypotheses are plausible explanations as to how the snow leopard got to the plains in Nepal.
A DNPWC official, who wished to remain anonymous as he is not authorised to talk to the press, said that it was more likely that the animal had been raised in captivity. 
“The way it sipped the water and ate the food zoo staff offered indicates that it may have been raised in captivity,” the official said.
Snow leopards are shy cats living at extreme altitudes in the steep mountainous areas of 12 countries in Central and South Asia. Their global population spread over altitudes of 500-5,800 m, is estimated to be between around 3,900 and 6,000 as detailed coordinated surveys of the population in the range countries are yet to be carried out. In Nepal, their population divided into three blocks (eastern, central and western) is estimated to be between 301 and 400.
Adhikari from NTNC said that researchers will now examine the animal’s scat to analyse its diet and try to find out whether it was roaming in the wild or had been in some sort of captivity. Researchers are also preparing to analyse its genes to try to find out to which of the three metapopulations in Nepal it belongs. They will also observe the animal’s canine teeth and fur to look for clues.
Relocation challenge

The whole process could take a few months to complete, and summer could set in in Kathmandu by then, officials concede. 
“The current temperature in Kathmandu is suitable for snow leopards, as we are in the peak of winter,” said Madhu Chetri, a snow leopard researcher from NTNC. But that could change as spring season begins in the Northern Hemisphere.
The DNPWC official said that regardless of the findings related to how the animal got to Urlabarli, the animal would have spent a significant amount of time with humans during its recovery phase. “That would mean that it would have gotten habituated with having humans around,” the official said.
Sending such animals back into the wild is a challenge, as they may have lost their hunting and other adaptation skills, he added. In May last year, officials at the Chitwan National Park released two rescued rhino calves into the wild, with limited success. The safety of the animals, which had gotten used to having humans around, was compromised as poachers could easily approach and kill them. Eventually, they were transferred to an enclosure in eastern Nepal away from human intervention.
Veteran conservationist Professor Karan Bahadur Shah said that rewilding the snow leopard would be a daunting task, as the animals are territorial. “If we just leave the animal in its natural habitat, it will get killed by other snow leopards defending their territory,” he said. “The best option would be to keep the animal in the zoo for the public to see.”
But Nepal’s Central Zoo has its own set of problems. The facility, established in 1932 as a private collection, has limited space and has frequently run into financial trouble. Conservationists say the snow leopard would need special facilities to cater to its needs.
“If the government decides that the snow leopard needs to remain at the zoo, we are ready to shoulder the responsibility,” said Adhikari. “We have set up special facilities for animals such as the red panda and chimpanzees,” he said. “We can do that for the snow leopard as well.”
Those advocating for keeping the animal in the zoo also said that Nepal is a snow leopard range country and the public, especially the young generation, also needs to see the different animals found in the country. “It has great educational value,” said Shah.
Snow leopard expert Suryawanshi from neighbouring India also said that it would be challenging to release the animal into the wild. 
“If the team at the zoo can establish the exact cause of this behaviour [why it ventured into the plains] and can keep the animal away from human contact, then it might be okay to release it back,” he said. “But otherwise, there is little hope for it in the wild. Better to let it live in the zoo.”
Back at the zoo, after the photojournalists are done taking photos, it is the turn of the reporters to point their smartphones at the animal. Then there is a contingent of senior wildlife department officials waiting in line to catch a glimpse of the animal. 
“So much for keeping it away from human contact,” a conservationist observing the hullabaloo from a distance said.

Nepal’s ‘low-altitude’ snow leopard would face big hurdles in return to wild 
","The National Assembly was formed to give experienced people a chance to be part of the parliament and help during the formation of important bills. In countries that follow the Westminster model of government, the upper house plays an important role. That, however, is not the case in Nepal as the country’s upper house has become a platform where individuals secure positions in the National Assembly based on their connections. As the election nears, many once again question the relevance and existence of the upper house.
Things were different in the past as the initial years of the National Assembly saw experienced politicians and experts others in their field be nominated for the post. That slowly changed as the first batch completed its two-year term.
“I understand why people are frustrated with the upper house. People expected experts but all we got was party cadres who lacked knowledge or experience,” says Bimala Rai Paudyal a National Assembly member. “Considering such behaviour and practices, what distinguishes the House of Representatives from the National Assembly?”
A loser’s second chance 
Narayan Kaji Shrestha, who faced defeat in the 2017 general election from Gorkha-2, was elected as a member of the National Assembly on January 23, 2020. Elected from Gandaki Province, Shrestha currently is the Deputy Prime Minister and Home Minister of the country.
Bhagwati Neupane who lost the election from Gandaki province and Bimala Ghimire who lost the election for mayorship in Bhanu Municipality also shared the same trajectory.
Similarly, Mrigendra Kumar Singh Yadav and Jag Prasad Sharma were defeated in the House of Representatives elections, from Saptari-4 and Dang-3 respectively are now members of the National Assembly. Bam Dev Gautam, who lost the elections from Bardiya, secured a place in the upper house through nomination by President Bidya Devi Bhandari.
Even those who did not win as ward member(s) got the opportunity to become members of the National Assembly including Sindh Bahadur Bishwakarma who was appointed on February 7, 2018. He is soon leaving his post on March 3.
Despite the repeated criticisms, the political parties have not paid attention to this concern posed by political leaders and the general public. The latest proof of this is the list of candidates for the National Assembly elections scheduled on January 25. The list contains names like Krishna Prasad Sitaula, defeated in the House of Representatives elections in 2022 from Koshi Province, and Pooja Chaudhary, who lost in the provincial assembly elections 2022 from Rautahat-3 (a).
Speaker Ganesh Prasad Timilsina, who led the National Assembly for the entire six years under the federal system, is also dissatisfied with the individuals who have made it to the upper house. 
“The allegations are something for the parties to ponder upon. The leaders should have prioritised involving intellectuals/neutrals rather than managing its members,” he says.
The 59-member National Assembly elects eight representatives, equally from all seven provinces, with an additional three individuals nominated by the President. The Constitution ensures representation of women, Dalits, minorities or disabled communities, envisioning that experts, experienced individuals, and the most qualified people from various fields will become members of the National Assembly.
Easy way in
File: A National Assembly meeting
There are some reasons why leaders aspire to join the upper house, and even the leadership create opportunities for them. 
In National Assembly elections, voters consist of local-level heads/deputy heads and provincial assembly members. Typically, individuals seeking these positions undergo a vetting process by their respective parties. As a result, aspiring members of parliament can focus less on persuading individual voters and more on gaining party support to secure their candidacy. 
Moreover, being a member of the National Assembly opens avenues to ministerial roles. The constitution prohibits a National Assembly member from becoming the Prime Minister, but not Deputy Prime Minister. Due to such opportunities, leaders are enticed to seek a position in the assembly.
The National Assembly is currently in its fourth election cycle since the promulgation of the Consitution in 2015. Scheduled for January 25, this election aims to fill 19 seats vacated by individuals completing their six-year terms. The previous election cycles took place in 2017, involving 56 members, followed by 2019 with 18 positions, and 2020 with 19 positions.
The cascading impacts
File: A National Assembly meeting
Another reason why the National Assembly is finding it difficult to justify itself is that it has become a shadow of the House of Representatives. The meeting of the National Assembly did not have one session when the House of Representatives was dissolved by then Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli twice. The demands and issues raised by the opposition parties in the House of Representatives automatically went to the National Assembly, where the parliamentarians of the ruling party put forward any proposal, they endorse it the same as in the House of Representatives.
The latest example – is the main opposition UML did not allow the meeting of the House of Representatives to continue for five days from July 5, 2023, due to a statement made by Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal during his visit to India. Consequently, the meeting of the National Assembly was also paused during that period.
The UML obstructed the House of Representatives for almost a month starting mid-July last year demanding a high-level inquiry committee to probe the 60-kilogram gold smuggling case and the resignation of the Home Minister. The National Assembly followed suit with leaders pushing their agendas forward.
Speaker Ganesh Timilsina himself is dissatisfied that every behaviour and activity of the House of Representatives influence the National Assembly. He says despite his attempts to prevent the overshadowing, it has been unfortunate that he did not garner the goodwill of the top leaders during political disputes.
Reinstating power
The National Assembly is a permanent institution. Therefore, it can remain operational even in the absence of the House of Representatives. Under normal circumstances, Speaker Timilsina initiated a positive practice by personally participating in different committees. Nevertheless, in the absence of the House of Representatives, the National Assembly often experienced inactivity.
In December 2020, the Prime Minister at that time, KP Sharma Oli, dissolved the House of Representatives. Subsequently, a session of the National Assembly was convened on January 1, 2021. Despite lasting only seven hours over four days, this session, which took place after the dissolution, failed to address crucial public issues. Even after six months, important matters remained unaddressed within the House.
On May 22, 2021, the UML-led government once again dissolved the House of Representatives. The meeting of the National Assembly and committees was affected once more. However, the dissolutions were declared unconstitutional by the Supreme Court, reinstating the parliament.
The Constitution says that despite the closing of the National Assembly session, thematic committee meetings can still take place. However, both the National Assembly and its committees remained inactive until the restoration of the House of Representatives.
According to Khimlal Devkota, a member of the National Assembly, when the House of Representatives was dissolved twice, it seemed that the National Assembly was also in a state of dissolution.
Bimala Rai Paudyal also believes that the inability to resume the upper house is a mark of weakness. 
“Since the government was not in a position to call, the President needed to be consulted by the chair together with the consultation committee. That was not done either,” she says.
Constitutional and legal distinctions

Except for the Constitution of Nepal (1962) and the Interim Constitution of Nepal (2007), all other constitutions in Nepal provided for a bicameral parliament with the National Assembly or the Upper House and the House of Representatives or the Lower House. The practices before 2015 were under the unitary governance system, but after the adoption of the federal democratic republican governance system, the role of the National Assembly has changed somewhat.
In the preamble of the constitution prepared by the ‘Constituent Assembly, and Administrative Organ Designation Committee’ during the drafting of the constitution, it is mentioned that some different qualifications have been prescribed for being a member of the House of Representatives and the National Assembly, with the intention that qualified people can be represented in the National Assembly.
Chair of the National Assembly Ganesh Prasad Timilsina restates that the members of the upper house should be assessed based on the country’s expectations with clear criteria. 
There is no definite definition of an expert in the constitution. It has been stated symbolically, “…It is expected that the members should have some basic skills to face the challenges and fulfil their responsibilities.”
According to the constitution, the responsibility of the National Assembly is to correctly establish the rights of the local level, state, and union, and to prevent the House of Representatives from trying to enact laws contrary to the spirit of federalism. There is an explanatory comment in the constitution about the propriety of the National Assembly – “This House is expected to fulfil its role to maintain creative and mutual relations between the national government and the provinces.”
In addition, there are some constitutional and legal differences regarding the National Assembly. But the MPs are demanding that it should cease. When a bill originating in the House of Representatives is passed and sent to the National Assembly, and if the latter does not decide within 60 days, it proceeds de facto.
This has placed the National Assembly in a dilemma. The Chairman of the National Assembly, Timilsina, says, “Such an arrangement should also apply to the House of Representatives, or both should be equal.”
Need for course correction 
PM Pushpa Kamal Dahal speaking in the National Assembly meeting.
Some instances have turned these so-called experts into a laughing stock due to their actions. 
On July 5, 2023,  a discussion on the Electronic Commerce (E-Commerce) Bill 2023 was tabled in the National Assembly. However, the parliamentarians misunderstood the main point and instead discussed the matter of electricity. The MPs, who had not read the proposal, suggested that electricity consumption within Nepal should also be increased besides exporting electricity to India and Bangladesh.
During the meeting, Ramesh Rijal, the Minister of Industry, Commerce and Supplies, also mentioned that India would purchase electricity during the Prime Minister’s visit. Unfortunately, the bill was unanimously approved.
Timilsina considers the incident an example, that in his six-year tenure, he does not want to remember. Som Bahadur Thapa, a former secretary at the Parliament Secretariat, termed the incident ‘a joke’ in the Parliament of Nepal. 
“This is strong proof of the kind of MPs we have, who speak without knowing what they are talking about.” 
Timilsina assumed the role of the speaker/chair of the National Assembly after the establishment of the Federal Democratic Republic. He had the opportunity to establish the system and the dignity of the National Assembly. However, instead of setting a positive example, he will soon be retiring after being accused of playing tricks with the Speaker and showing interest in the work of the House of Representatives.
Timilsina has repeatedly commented on the affairs of the House of Representatives. The latest instance was during a seminar on ‘Japan: Past, Present, and Future’ held in the capital on December 2, 2023, he publicly stated that the election results of the House of Representatives did not bode well.
Pointing to the emergence of a new party and the victory of some independent candidates, he said, “In a democracy, you get to choose candidates, irrespective of their party affiliation. However, is the signal positive?”
In August/ September 2022, Timilsina wrote a letter to the Election Commission, urging them to extend the tenure of Speaker and Deputy Speaker. Upon receiving a response stating that the Commission would not determine the tenure of the elected Parliament, Timilsina directed the Parliament Secretariat not to execute decisions made by the Management Committee after September 17, 2022.
This created conflict between the Speaker of the House of Representatives and the Speaker of the National Assembly and in the crux of this dispute between the parties, the country had to bear the consequences of this conflict. Laws could not be enacted promptly, and the place once considered the domain of experts was overshadowed by the party’s interest. 
A study conducted by the Democracy Resource Center Nepal (DRCN) on the legislative functioning of the National Assembly has revealed that the Upper House has passed some bills that go against the spirit of federalism.
The report’s concluding remarks say, “…the bills passed by the House of Representatives have not undergone significant changes or discussions in the National Assembly. The conclusion section of the study states that – “Furthermore, some bills, contradicting the spirit of federalism and addressing the interests of interest groups, have been approved by the National Assembly.”
Overall, in the last six years, parties have introduced individuals who, given their presentation level, have raised questions about the National Assembly’s justification. If there are no changes in the constitution, laws, and policies concerning the upper assembly, these concerns will persist.”"

6 years on, the National Assembly has struggled to show its worth 
","Representational image Photo by Tanushree Rao on Unsplash
While most of the nation was preparing for the festival of lights, Tihar in early November 2023, something no less exciting was fuelling our sparks from oceans away. A queer art festival was happening for the seventeenth year and we had a chance to attend it as delegates. Our delegation was made possible through the collaboration between the Outburst Arts, an art organisation based in Northern Ireland, UK and the British Council, Nepal.
There is a clear distinction between cities in terms of their flourishing arts scenes, and this became apparent during a visit to Belfast, Northern Ireland, specifically for the Outburst Queer Arts Festival held in the charming city centre. The organisation of such a festival requires months of careful preparation and planning.
The queer art festival started as short events lasting a few days. Now, after 17 years, it has grown into a ten-day festival with panel discussions, theatre performances, and exhibitions. Program guides were available at venues, partner hotels, local libraries, and shops. Many delegates, including us, came from outside Northern Ireland to attend.
During the queer art festival, we had the opportunity to connect with art curators, publishers, artists, and representatives from other British Council departments around the world (Lithuania, France, South Africa, Turkey, Greece, Jordan, England, and Argentina to name a few.) 
Each event that we attended gave us a different insight into what the arts can do and how it can facilitate connections. We gained insights from queer publishers and art curators on the challenges they face in their own countries due to resources and sometimes from bureaucracy in systems. We also got to see the way people can thrive when given a platform to showcase their works, such as an art exhibition in which the artist reimagined intimacy for queer people.
On the other hand, Nepal struggles by and large at times for queer visibility. There are no explicit spaces for SOGIESC (Sexual Orientation, Gender Identity and Expressions and Sex Characteristics) artists to showcase their works nor openly come together as a community, it all exists in pocket spaces. In the same way, something that struck us was the presence of older queer artists at the festival. 
It was not just for one particular event during the queer art festival. We noticed an active participation and involvement of older queer people throughout the festival there. It was fascinating to see queer artists in their 40s and 50s share their transformative and inspiring work. Whereas, back home, the queer folks at the forefront of queer art, advocacy and activism are mostly Gen-Zs and millennials. We have very few queer elders that we can count on our fingers who are diligently working for Nepali queer folks. Even among them, some still hold onto archaic notions and refuse to evolve and embrace changes. So, there’s that.
From dream to reality

Before being selected as delegates, both of us joined online meetings with British Council Nepal and the Outburst representatives facilitated through Kaalo 101 (an art space in Patan), along with interested queer artists from Nepal. We had a total of three meetings where we discussed the possibilities and challenges of doing a queer art festival in Nepal. 
The discourse also entailed us sharing a presentation about the updates of the queer art scene in Nepal in the last five years. The updates included memorable leaps taken in queer arts from music to literature and fashion and more by artists from diverse walks of life. Days after the third meeting, the British Council extended invitations to us to attend the Outburst Queer Arts Festival.
Our delegation is just one example of the transcontinental collaboration because it was something that happened for the first time and involved us. But, Outburst Arts and the British Council have been practising cross-continental collaboration for years. Even in this year’s festival, we witnessed a lot of artists from different continents work together in exhibitions, lectures, panel discussions, magazines and so on. The amalgamation introduced us to brilliant thought-provoking work that defies gender and sociopolitical norms. The power of transcontinental collaboration was beyond beautiful.
Imagining queer arts in Nepal

The queer art scene in Nepal is an emerging one. While a full-fledged festival may not be possible now, something small yet significant is achievable. Time and again, different organisations have been running large art exhibitions/tours for weeks and months. However, in the microcosm that is Nepal, especially Kathmandu, the capital is no stranger to art-oriented programs. What it has been unfamiliar with precisely is queer art. And the unfamiliarity is not something induced by the lack of queer artists and their art. Sadly, it is because of inadequate platforms, space and resources to pursue queer arts.
Despite this, through the years there have been events and literature that have emerged centring on queer identity, but it has not come without its challenges. On collections of stories, “Pride Climbing Higher” and “Songs of Revolution” showcase stories from Nepalis across Nepal. There are not many stories reflecting the Nepali queer experiences otherwise. 
June Pride Parade by Queer Youth Group has gained momentum as well in the past few years since its conception, from a small gathering to now a large parade with performances from community members. The same can be said about Blue Diamond Society’s (BDS) Rainbow Visibility Pride events in August during the festival of Saa-Paru (Gai Jatra) which has been running for well over a decade; in recent years they have included flash mobs and interaction programmes as well in lead up to their parade. Individuals within the community have also organised their queer gatherings with friends, thus coming back to the cosmos of pocket spaces in celebrating queerness.
While artists like us are creative with what we want to put out, we still need organisations like the British Council to foster spaces and connections to enable us to do that. Then and again, artists have come together and collaborated on queer-centric projects. But, we need funding and resources to achieve bigger-scale projects that unite more artists and transcend borders.
Both of us advocate for queer rights and are involved in programs and activities that push the narrative further, extend the visibility of the community and normalise conversations surrounding queerness. Among other things, we are also the founders of Queering The Bond, a networking collective for Nepali queer folks and Shuby is also the founder of Queer Honky-Tonk, a platform to promote queer performances and networking with events such as a drag show or open mic every few months. However, both of us, individually or collaboratively can only do so much. 

The challenges of living in a capitalistic world oftentimes outweigh the passion we have for the queer art scene in Nepal. And this is where we expect the government and organisations to step up with policies, platforms and programs to provide spaces, opportunities and resources for queer artists. Here, the British Council joined hands with Outburst Arts, which paved the way for our delegation. We would not have known about the marvellous queer art festival at the other end of the world otherwise.
Besides the limitations brought by insufficient spaces and social unawareness, the centralised capital does hinder queer artists from outside the city to connect, create and collaborate. Art already is centralised and elitist. On top of that, the concentrated Kathmandu Valley is of no help when it comes to making art accessible beyond its borders.
Furthermore, there is also the expectation from basically everyone to have the perfect festival that caters to all people’s needs and wants. While the festival, if it should happen, is bound to be done with the right intentions, there is a lot of pressure for the first-time event itself. The festival will be inclusive and diverse. But, realistically speaking, it would be a struggle to make it relevant to each queer person from east to west.
Speaking of struggles, a visceral feeling of uneasiness swarmed over me with each step I took while exiting the airport after the flight back home. I, Birat, personally felt that I could not be as free or unrestrained in Nepal as I was during my time in Belfast. No wonder a lot of the queer people we know opt for abroad.
Seventeen years ago, when the Outburst Queer Arts Festival first began, it certainly was not as celebrated or large as it is now. What we are trying to convey here is that we do not have to start big. We can aim for something small yet promising. While there might be expectations to check all the boxes, it is crucial to be mindful of our capacity as well. But, we can be capacitated and this is where you – people in power, art enthusiasts, grant and resource allocators and media come in. It is time we all believe in Nepali queer art and create space for it to not only survive but thrive. It is imperative to understand that formulating our imagination into reality can only be possible through unwavering collaboration."

Queer art festival: Reflecting and imagining the power of collaboration in Nepal 
","The month of January saw major road accidents in different parts of the country, including Lamhi in Dang, Dhorpatan in Baglung, and Chandragiri in Kathmandu. Road accidents have been common throughout the country with Nepal Police data suggesting over 2,500 people dying in them annually. Despite this, the Ministry of Finance has shown reluctance to introduce the proposed Road Safety Bill to reduce traffic accidents, fatalities, and serious injuries, and enhance road safety. 
Instead, the Finance Ministry has asked the Ministry of Physical Infrastructure and Transport to include the proposed bill in the Public Roads Act. Along with that, the government’s initiative to pass dedicated laws on road safety and set up a mechanism, including the empowered National Road Safety Council (NRSC), to decrease accidents, has come to a halt.
Keshav Kumar Sharma, secretary of the Ministry of Physical Infrastructure and Transport, says they asked for a dedicated road safety law that comprehensively addresses institutional arrangements was the need of the hour. This includes ensuring safety in road construction, promoting public awareness, providing training and communication facilities, implementing rescue mechanisms, and arranging rehabilitation for families affected by road accidents. However, the Ministry of Finance believes a separate law is unnecessary due to concerns about potential increased financial burden.
Hourly need

Officials from the Ministry of Physical Infrastructure allege that the Ministry of Finance is approaching sensitive matters, such as passenger safety, solely from an economic standpoint. They say that concerns related to road, vehicle, and passenger safety are being overshadowed, and there are indications that this approach will continue. 
“The government is avoiding addressing the sensitive issue of road accidents and the associated human and material costs, fearing an increase in expenses. This contradicts the government’s commitment and policy to reduce traffic accidents in the future,” says an official from the Ministry of Physical Infrastructure on the condition of anonymity.
According to the Ministry of Physical Infrastructure, the existing laws lack the vision and purpose necessary for developing a sustainable, safe, risk-free, and reliable transportation operation and security system. Therefore, the Ministry of Physical Infrastructure officials argue that a distinct law is essential to decrease road accidents and ensure the safety of pedestrians, including passenger transport workers and roadside residents, as well as pets, wild animals, and birds. 
“The Road Safety Act is the need of the hour as it will help us during post-accident rescue, treatment management, rehabilitation, and legal representation,” says the official.
Currently, there are gaps in enforcing road rules, monitoring vehicle capacities, ensuring road structure safety, managing traffic signs, and organizing road safety facilities. The implementation of the Road Safety Act is seen as crucial to address these issues.
However, there has not been a facilitative environment for providing education and raising awareness about road traffic safety, safety mechanisms, and coordinating among organisations related to road transport. The aspect of training drivers with skills and knowledge, as well as monitoring road safety on the roads, is also lacking. This is why experts have been suggesting introducing a separate road safety law to address these aspects.
The Finance Ministry, however, says that road safety should not be downplayed by ignoring human sensibilities related to road safety and citing economic reasons. Officials from the Ministry of Physical Infrastructure argue that incorporating safety considerations in the Road Act does not automatically result in a decrease in accidents or the integration of post-accident rescue, relief, and rehabilitation efforts.
“The existing laws do not address road safety anywhere. Due to its lack of clarity and inadequacy, it has not been implemented with due diligence. For instance, provisions such as those for vehicle inspectors outlined in the Transport Act have not been acted upon by the government,” says an official from the Transport Ministry.
Policies and commitments, but no laws

The Motor Vehicles and Transport Management Act (1993) includes several provisions related to vehicle registration, road permits, driver’s licenses, traffic management, insurance, and penalties. The Public Roads Act (1974) primarily focuses on road management. However, there is no provision in the Act regarding the National Road Safety Council.
In this situation, Nepal has developed a 10-year road safety action plan but is yet to enact corresponding legislation. Unfortunately, government agencies and mechanisms are not obligated to follow the action plan, as it lacks legal guidance.
Now, the Transport Ministry holds the view that if safety considerations are explicitly addressed in the Public Roads Act, the outcome will not differ from what the Finance Ministry has said. Given the Public Roads Act’s close association with the Department of Road, the ministry thinks greater emphasis will be placed on road construction. However, they argue that incorporating the road safety aspect into the Act would not be effective.
Secretary Sharma of the Transport Ministry is tasked with ensuring road safety, overseeing physical infrastructure and transport, and coordinating efforts across education, health, home, law, federal affairs, and general administration ministries. This responsibility extends to provincial ministries, local levels, as well as various agencies, organisations, security agencies, non-governmental organisations, and related entities, each with their specific roles.
“As all the agencies need to be allocated responsibilities for various aspects of road safety, we have requested them to collaborate in formulating a distinct law. This should encompass the reduction of all types of accidents,” said Sharma.
The ministry believes that a dedicated law addressing road safety is crucial to mitigate severe road accidents in Nepal and to uphold the commitments made by the country on the international stage.
Nepal has committed to implementing the Stockholm Declaration through the Global Road Traffic Safety Conference in 2020, as per the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. Nepal, which has incorporated sustainable development goals into its national development plan, has not yet commenced work aligned with these objectives.

Nevertheless, Nepal’s neighbouring countries are already addressing road safety through legal frameworks. Various states in India have enacted road safety laws, and the effectiveness of these laws is contributing to a 50 per cent reduction in road accidents.
In 1999, Bhutan also introduced a unified road safety and transport act. Pakistan, on the other hand, issued the National Highway Safety Ordinance-2000 to ensure road safety, distinct from its National Highway Authority Act (1991). Britain, Australia, America, New Zealand, and other countries have established separate road safety laws as well.
Road safety neglected
In Nepal, road safety has been consistently neglected due to the absence of dedicated legislation. Road safety expert Keshav Adhikari says that the government primarily focused on road construction, overlooks crucial aspects such as road safety and reinforcement. Consequently, roads are transforming into perilous pathways for both vehicles and passengers.
“There is a lack of interest in formulating policies and laws aimed at mitigating financial losses resulting from accidents,” says Adhikari.
He further points out that safety is not a governmental priority, as expanding the road network is perceived to yield more political benefits than implementing additional structures to enhance road safety.
“When I worked as an expert in the Transport Ministry for over a year, I realised that promoting road safety is not a government priority,” he says. “Annually, more people die due to road accidents than those who die in natural disasters, but the government has not given it much attention.”
Even though the prime minister, ministers, and MPs keep asserting that roads have been constructed, no one seems to be addressing the critical issues of road safety and quality.
Saroj Sitaula, General Secretary of the Federation of Nepalese National Transport Entrepreneurs (FNNTE), says that the government must be attentive as accidents are on the rise due to various technical and human factors, including road infrastructure. 
“Many accidents can be mitigated by improving road conditions, installing barriers on the sides, putting up informational boards, and ensuring scientific and practical road markings,” he says. “We need to formulate a plan and progress accordingly.”
Sitaula argues that the government should establish policies to create mechanisms for emergency rescue, treatment, and rehabilitation after an accident occurs. He emphasises the importance of enhancing road infrastructure, conducting a scientific examination of the technical condition of vehicles, and ensuring compliance with the law by drivers, passengers, and regulators. He says that blaming drivers and transport entrepreneurs for accidents is inadequate, and the government must fulfil its responsibilities.
Roads are unsafe

Nepal currently boasts a road network spanning approximately 100,000 km, with the majority consisting of dirt and gravel roads. Among the more than 22,000 kilometres of national and subsidiary highways, numerous sections remain unpaved.
Despite the government’s substantial investment in road construction and expansion, minimal efforts are allocated to ensuring road safety. 
Recently, all three levels of government have accelerated the widening of roads, incorporating asphalt and slopes. However, it appears that issues concerning road quality and safety are escalating at a faster pace. Roads that have been neglected in the guise of maintenance have become a nightmare for the public.
Infrastructure expert Suryaraj Acharya notes that these problems arise due to the tendency to construct roads only after they have sustained damage, without considering potential issues during the initial construction phase."

Realme has launched its popular mid-range number series smartphone, the Realme 12 Pro series. The series includes the Realme 12 Pro 5G and the Realme 12 Pro+ 5G which are the successors of the Realme 11 Pro+ 5G and Realme 11 Pro 5G respectively. The Realme 11 series was widely appreciated for its design and performance at the price range. 
The 12 series has stepped up the game with an even better design. Realme has not only changed the design but has also upgraded the performance and the camera to compete in the mid-range price market. Realme recently has been focusing a lot on the design aspect and the price range performance. 
The 12 Pro+ has some major differences from last year’s 11 Pro+ which include design, IP rating, chipset, camera and charging. 
Let us see what the luxuriously designed smartphone delivers in terms of specs.

Design and Display
The Realme 12 Pro+ and the Realme 12 Pro share the same design and dimensions. The design is fascinating. Realme patterned up with Luxury Swiss Watch designer Ollivier Savéo to craftfully design the smartphone. 
All the colour options have a vegan leather back. Since the phone is designed by a luxury watch designer, it comes with a big round camera module housing the triple camera setup. There is a golden 3D Jubilee Bracelet which gives the texture of a luxury watch strap. A golden patterned line runs through the middle and around the camera module for an even better look.

Realme 12 Pro+ 5G: Is it the best designed phone for 2024? 
","Ram Bujhaun Yadav with his land ownership certificate stands near a border pillar which he says was erroneously placed on his land. 
In October 2023, when 51-year-old Ram Bujhaun Yadav of Musaharnia Rural Municipality-5, Mukhiyapatti, Dhanusha, was at a relative’s house, someone told him that two Indian Sashastra Seema Bal (SSB) personnel were looking for him.
Anxious, he rushed home wondering why they were looking for him.
“They asked me if the paddy field in the no man’s land was mine. I told them yes and they asked me to cut down the paddy immediately,” he said.
The paddy was not ripe and Yadav asked them for some time. However, the SSB personnel told him he had to cut down his paddy immediately.
Ram Bujhaun and his wife Tetari Devi each own a 677-square-metre plot of land. As Nepal and India reevaluated the border, Ram Bujhan’s land was been deemed to be near the no man’s land as it now has two demarcation pillars.
Frustrated, Ram Bujhaun cut the paddy before it was due to be harvested. Now, he has been asked to not plant anything on the land as it falls in the no man’s land.
“Our border police don’t say a word. I can’t fight the SSB on my own,” says Ram Bujhaun adding he had decided not to plan anything on the land anymore.
Woes of the farmers
Many farmers in southern Nepal say their land has now been placed in India after the recent demarcation. 
When the Jamuna River, which flows through the no man’s land between Nepal and India, changed its course some two decades ago, some border pillars went missing. Locals say these pillars have now been placed encroaching on Nepali land.
In 2018, with the then Chief District Officer of Dhanusha, Pradeep Raj Kandel, and an official from Madhubani district, Bihar, India, a team that included border security forces from both countries, the Armed Police Force of Nepal, and SSB of India began placing border pillars after land measurement by technicians.
Locals have raised concerns, stating that border pillars have been positioned, encroaching approximately 50 to 100 meters of land into Nepal compared to the previous position. Many like Ram Bujhaun are unaware of when these border pillars were placed.
“I did not know that pillar was placed here. After I found out when I asked the village leaders, many said they were placing the border pillars as they pleased,” said Ram Bujhaun.
He was told to carry on planting paddy and that it would not matter as these issues had happened in the past. 
“They encroached on my land and have asked me not to plant anything. This is gross injustice,” he says.
Ram Bujhaun’s family owns a total of 4,000 square metres of land, with 2,000 square metres belonging to him and the remaining 2,000 square metres to his brother Bechan. However, 1,000 square metres of his land is now located on the Indian side after the demarcation. Despite this, he has been farming on the land and continues to pay taxes to the Department of Land Management and Archive in Nepal.
“They have marked my land to be on the Indian side and placed border pillars on it. I’ve been farming till now but I don’t know when they will ask me to stop,” he says.
Ignorance of the government
The Madhesh province in southern Nepal
The former ward chair of Mukhiyapatti Musharniya Rural Municipality-5, Ram Naresh Yadav, said that over time, India has encroached on numerous Nepali lands in various locations in the Madhesh Province. This, he says, happened due to the Nepali administration’s ignorance and weak stature.
“They (Nepali administration) were careless and that meant the Indian side placed these border pillars by encroaching on Nepali land,” says Ram Naresh.
He said that over 40 farmers from wards 1, 5, and 6 have land ranging from 300 to 1,600 square metres on the Indian side. 
“These farmers have land ownership certificates, but they cannot farm as the SSB says the land is in India and not Nepal,” said Ram Naresh.
In 1996, land ownership certificates were distributed after surveying the land in the border area. Local Dharmendra Kumar Yadav said that since then, the locals have been paying their land tax regularly. In 2018, when the pillar was being placed, the locals protested when they saw their land was being encroached on. However, since the demarcation had been agreed upon by high-ranking government officials of Nepal and India, the farmer’s voices went unheard.
“We tried to stop when the border pillars were being placed on our land. But the administrators from both sides forcibly put it there without even trying to hold a discussion,” said Harish Chandra Yadav. 
The Chief District Officer of Dhanusha, Chakrapani Pandey, says that the border pillars were placed by the technical team after the measurements and with the agreement of the high-ranking officials of the two countries.
“The fields and houses that are built in no man’s land have recently been cleared. No one can do anything in this particular area,” said Pandey. “We understand the people’s concern but we cannot do anything about it now.”"

Life is filled with surprises and unexpected events and it can change at any moment. The only thing certain in life is the uncertainty. Change is a natural and inevitable part of our lives, and it may be positive as well as negative.
Even though it is not guaranteed that we will wake up in the morning, we set the alarm every night with the hope that we will wake up in the morning. We do not know what each day is going to bring us, but we may have varieties, adventures, and endless opportunities.
The push to explore
The uncertainty sometimes forces us to explore those aspects of life, we never knew existed or needed. It also tests the mental strength of people and how they deal with it. The uncertainty has taught me to be grateful, as we never know what life throws at us.
In life, everything does not go according to our plans, and if we do not embrace the change we will face huge trouble. The Covid-19 pandemic is the best example of uncertainty, we were constantly fearing death and it was uncertain that we would see the sunrise the next day.
It is not certain that every decision in life will be correct, but if you fear not trying at all, you miss endless opportunities for learning and growing. When our decisions or outcomes are on the negative side, we get depressed and we might tend to think about committing suicide, but we forget that if we have life we have endless opportunities. 
Most of us plan for our careers, our love life, etc. and when those plans do not work out we start getting uncomfortable. But if we can deal with today, we can surely deal with tomorrow. We need to cherish little moments in our lives and know that nothing is permanent not even the failures and setbacks.
We come here with nothing and leave with nothing. So why should we hold the egos and grudges against each other? Instead of making our life meaningful and enjoying the journey of life, we get into puzzles of accumulating wealth and we go against our own loved ones for it. 
Change is certain

Nothing is permanent in life, everything can change in fractions of seconds. In today’s society, everyone is so busy, that we people have so less time for our loved ones. What I have learned over the years, is to find time in our busy schedule for our family because we never know when it will be our last day together with them. 
Yes! Death is a natural process, so if you have to die someday, why should you die with grudges in your heart? But instead of worrying about the inevitable, focusing on the things you can control will bring a lot of happiness in life.
Uncertainty is not only a negative thing; it also brings a lot of opportunity because you dare to change. The life-changing experience will not come knocking down your door, you need to expose yourself. We learn by doing and experimenting, even though we might fail. But that is not the end of the world. I still remember hesitating while applying for the role of leadership, at my school level as it was not certain that I would be chosen.
Even after being selected, I was uncertain about whether I could fulfil my responsibilities or not. But that uncertainty helped me grow out of my comfort zone and give my best input. If I had not applied for that role just because I was uncertain of the outcome, I would miss the biggest learning opportunity in my school life. So, do not let the uncertainty or the unknown ever stop you from trying and no matter how much we try, to plan life always finds a way to surprise us. 
It is important to stay grounded when we have everything we wish for because life can take such a turn that we had never expected in our wildest dreams. Similarly, nothing is permanent in life, the financial hardships, the grades, the breakups, etc. But the most important thing is not to lose hope during those difficult times.
According to the data provided by Nepal police, around 6,830 people took their lives in the fiscal year 2022/23. There is nothing in life that cannot be resolved although it may take time, committing suicide should not be an option. It’s important to share feelings among family members or loved ones because together as a family any problem can be overcome.
Embrace the unknown and focus on enhancing your life, instead of worrying about what will happen next. Always find time for your loved ones, as life is uncertain. We should be grateful that we are alive and accept that change is the only constant thing in life. Do not let the unknown, stop you from trying or achieving your goals and always remember that even if you fail, you still have endless opportunities."

Examining the uncertainty of life 
","Vincenzo Alberto Annese has tried to change the culture of the Nepal football team. 
Kathmandu, December 19
The All Nepal Football Association has renewed the contract of the men’s head coach, Vincenzo Alberto Annese.
During the executive committee meeting of ANFA on Monday, it was decided to extend the responsibilities of the head coach for a total of three and a half months, equivalent to 105 days.
This means he will remain as head coach for at least the remaining four matches of the 2026 FIFA World Cup Qualifiers. 
Annese was appointed head coach of the men’s football team on March 1 on a one-year deal. 
His contract was renewed before his contract expired on March 1 as ANFA wanted him to lead the national team in the remaining four matches of the World Cup Qualifiers. 
Vincenzo Alberto Annese has time and again stated he wants to remain head coach of the Nepali football team.
In the course of 13 matches, Annese has overseen four victories and two draws, with seven defeats."

Nepal were humbled by India in their third group game of the U19 Asia Cup being held in Dubai.

Asked to bat first, Nepal were bowled out for only 52 runs as the Indian bowlers decimated the Nepali batters. In reply, India chased down the total in 7. 1 overs. 
Nepal’s batting has been poor throughout the tournament. The team only made 152 against Pakistan which they chased easily in the 27th over. Afghanistan also proved to be too good for Nepal as they bowled them out for 188 winning the match by 73 runs.
The team will now take part in the 2024 U19 World Cup where the team has been drawn against New Zealand, Pakistan and Afghanistan."

ANFA renews Vincenzo Alberto Annese’s contract
","Nepali footballers celebrate with the fans after winning the Prime Minister’s Three Nations Cup in March 2023. 
Nepal played its first international football match on October 13, 1972 in Beijing. Despite scoring two goals, Nepal was defeated by China who scored six. 
Furthermore, YB Ghale holds the distinction of being recognised as the first Nepali footballer to score an international goal. This happened during the 1982 Asian Games in New Delhi, India, where he netted a goal against Kuwait.
If you want to research the roots of domestic football in Nepal, you have to go back to the Rana Regime. The Tribhuvan Challenge Shield, inaugurated in 1948, stands as one of the oldest football tournaments in the country. Soon the All Nepal Football Association (ANFA), the governing body overseeing football activities in Nepal, was established in 1951.
Currently, Nepali football finds itself at a crucial juncture, facing a do-or-die situation. The challenges and dynamics present in contemporary Nepal are mirrored in the world of football, adding an extra layer of significance to the sport’s current state in the country.
Worry state of football
The football turf at Dasharath Stadium is in a dire state. Photo: Bikash Shrestha 
Nepali football continues to grapple with a lack of infrastructure for football matches, whether at the national or international level. The Dasharath Stadium stands as the solitary international venue in the country, catering to both international matches and crucial domestic competitions. Its post-2015 earthquake reconstruction was specifically undertaken to ensure its readiness for hosting events like the South Asian Games. 
The existing stadiums and grounds in Nepal are insufficient, and the football grounds in cities like Pokhara and Biratnagar still lack professional management. Additionally, the primary national league for domestic football, the Martyr’s Memorial A-Division League, has been constrained to the Kathmandu Valley. While in earlier editions matches were also held in Pokhara, recent seasons have seen a shift, with matches no longer being played at Pokhara
In the 45th edition of the Martyr’s Memorial A-Division League in 2023, 14 teams participated in the competition. Despite the significant number of participating teams, the quality of the football matches fell short of audience expectations. The matches held during the event failed to attract the desired viewership. Consequently, the ongoing Nepal Super League has strategically scheduled matches in the evening, possibly as an effort to enhance audience engagement and attendance.
Furthermore, fans have expressed disillusionment with the A Division League, citing ANFA’s inability to establish a consistent schedule each year. Both in the A Division League and the Nepal Super League, teams frequently play matches twice or thrice a week, exposing players to a higher risk of injuries. The duration of domestic leagues remains limited, and significant gaps exist between football competitions on the national stage. During these periods of inactivity, players face the added challenge of no earnings, emphasising the financial strain on Nepali footballers during lulls in the football calendar.
Question of sustainability
danielkirsch for Pixabay
The salary of a footballer in the Nepali football national team is very low. It is difficult to sustain economically by Nepali players because most national footballers do not get sponsors.
At present, a few players play in foreign leagues and represent in Nepali football national team. Players want to play for Nepal but their economic condition pushes them away from football. The domestic league of Nepal is completed in such a short time interval that these players do not know what to do for more than half of a year when there is no league at all.
Likewise, looking at the history of the domestic league in Nepal, there is no certainty that the league will occur in the scheduled period. Before the onset of the Covid pandemic, A-Division clubs were actively engaged in district-level cup tournaments. However, these tournaments have nearly ground to a halt in the aftermath of the pandemic. 
Additionally, businesses have shown reluctance to invest in Nepali football, largely due to the economic crisis brought on by the pandemic. The challenging economic landscape has had a cascading effect, affecting both the grassroots-level tournaments and the willingness of businesses to contribute to the development of Nepali football.
The grassroots level of Nepali football faces significant challenges. There is a noticeable absence of grassroots competitions across the country. In the Kathmandu Valley, the scarcity of grounds further restricts children’s access to play football.
While futsal grounds have been established, their small size and associated costs limit accessibility. These futsal facilities are not easily available to the wider public. Moreover, schools tend to be less enthusiastic about promoting games and sports like football due to a shortage of grounds and concerns about the potential for injuries in such sports. The overall scenario underscores the need for increased infrastructure, affordability, and a more encouraging environment to nurture football at the grassroots level in Nepal.
Ever evolving football

Modern football is evolving day by day. Legendary footballers once prominent in European football leagues are now making their mark in Asia’s Saudi Pro League. Our neighbour, India, has also undergone a significant transformation in football through the Indian Super League (ISL).
Under the leadership of footballer Sunil Chhetri, Indian football has experienced a remarkable change over the past decade. Chhetri’s influence has played a pivotal role in shaping the face of Indian football. The last time Nepal’s national side secured a victory against India was in the 2013 SAFF Championship.
Since then, India has tremendously worked on the quality of its football team, which is visible in the FIFA rankings along with its domestic infrastructure and the opportunities the players get.  
However, FIFA rankings are not the only factor that decides the future of the football national team, which probably means there is still hope for the Nepali football team.
With the FIFA World Cup 2026, which is supposed to be held in Canada, Mexico and the United States extending teams number up to 48, FIFA World Cup Qualifiers have been more exciting and thrilling than before.
Now, we can see Asian teams performing good quality football matches because it was not expected the same before with Asian teams. Now, football is expanding from its boundary of Europe or South America domination because, in the decade of 2020, we have seen huge changes in football in North America, Africa and Asia including Australia.
In Nepal’s case, the ANFA currently lacks a comprehensive visionary roadmap to reach the Asian Cup and FIFA World Cup. Getting to these tournaments requires the national team to approach each match with a focus on gaining experience and acquiring the necessary skills. A mindset that prioritises learning over immediate results is crucial for preparing the team to tackle future challenges effectively. 
Nepal has consistently produced energetic and skilful players and hired coaches who exhibit comparable levels of energy and proficiency to their counterparts in European or other football teams.
However, for football to yield positive outcomes, it is crucial to have visionary leaders and committees within ANFA and the National Sports Council who possess a deep understanding of the sport. There seems to be a perception that individuals in key positions in ANFA and the National Sports Council may not fully grasp that football is not merely a game; it also serves as a representation of a nation to the rest of the world.
Another thing is that Nepali football is compared with the Nepali national men’s cricket team. Nepali men’s senior team played in the Asia Cup for the first time and it also qualified for the T20 World Cup in 2024.
The first thing one needs to understand is that football and cricket are two different sports. These two sports should not be compared with each other. We are Nepali and we should support both sports and other sports. Sports are also representations of the nation. So, as a Nepali, let’s support football too.
It is time that concerned authorities should recognise that football is not only a sport but also the emotions of millions of Nepali football fans."

","The organisers of the Nepal Super League are leaving no stone unturned to ensure the success of the second edition of Nepal’s only franchise football league. Employing various strategies and methods, they aim to make the tournament special and leave a lasting impression on football fans across the country.
The news of the legendary former Chelsea and Ivory Coast striker, Didier Drogba, gracing the league has stirred excitement among football fans across the country.
In another significant development, the upcoming tournament marks the first time fans will be allowed, a contrast from the inaugural edition held during the pandemic, which did not permit audience attendance.
Despite the Martyrs Memorial League not meeting fan expectations, organisers express confidence in the Nepal Super League attracting a considerable audience. This optimism has generated excitement among players, who are eagerly anticipating the resurgence of a vibrant footballing atmosphere in Kathmandu.
Battle of the cities
Kathmandu Rayzrs celebrate winning the inaugural Nepal Super League.
Seven franchise teams participated in the inaugural edition of the Nepal Super League. The champion, Kathmandu Razyrs FC, competed against Dhangadhi FC, Lalitpur City FC, Pokhara Thunders, FC Chitwan, Biratnagar City FC, and Butwal Lumbini FC.
For the upcoming tournament, three new teams — Jhapa FC, Sporting Ilam de Mechi, and Birgunj United — have been added to the Nepal Super League. However, Biratnagar FC has decided not to participate in the second edition. Consequently, a total of nine teams will now contend for the championship in a single round-robin format, involving 40 matches, including qualifiers and finals.
The Nepal Super League, slated to run from November 24 to December 30, will feature two matches on six days and only one match on the remaining days. The inaugural match will showcase former champions Kathmandu Razyrs against the new entrant, Sporting Ilam de Mechi.
Introducing brand ambassador

The teams participating in the Nepal Super League are pioneering the introduction of brand ambassadors to promote their respective clubs. Leading the way in this initiative are Lalitpur City FC, Jhapa FC, Butwal Lumbini FC and Dhangadhi FC.
Lalitpur City has selected Sadina Shrestha, the captain of the Nepali women’s national basketball team, as its brand ambassador. Meanwhile, Dhangadhi FC, the runners-up of the first edition, has enlisted TikTok influencer Miss Pabi to represent the team.
Following the same trend, Jhapa FC has appointed Nepali footballing legend Hari Khadka as its brand ambassador, while Butwal Lumbini FC has secured the services of the legendary cricketer Shakti Gauchan, a stalwart of the Nepali cricket team, to serve as its brand ambassador.
International coaches
Lalitpur City FC coach Ian Andrew Gillan
In the inaugural edition of the Nepal Super League, Yan Law was the sole foreign coach, guiding Biratnagar FC. Likewise, Lalitpur City was under the supervision of Pradeep Humagai, an American citizen of Nepali origin. This time around, three out of the nine teams have hired the expertise of seasoned foreign coaches.
Lalitpur City FC has named Australian Ian Andrew Gillan as the head coach for the upcoming season. Jhapa FC has brought in Oriol Mohedano Segura from Spain to lead the team, while FC Chitwan has secured the services of Indian Mehrajuddin Wadoo for the coaching position. Initially, FC Chitwan had appointed India’s Khalid Jamil as the head coach, but the contract was mutually terminated.
The remaining six teams have Nepali coaches at the helm. Former champion Balgopal Maharjan continues to lead Kathmandu Razyrs, and Navin Neupane remains with Pokhara Thunders. Kishore Rai is retained as the coach for Dhangadhi FC.
Meghraj KC, who coached Chitwan in the first edition, has assumed the role of head coach for Sporting Ilam de Mechi this time. Meanwhile, Sanoj Shrestha, the former coach of Butwal Lumbini FC, is now leading Birgunj United. The head coaching position for Butwal Lumbini has been filled by Bijay Maharjan.
Young marquee players galore
Nepal Super League marquee players.
In the inaugural edition of the Nepal Super League, seasoned and renowned players held the position of marquee players. However, a recent shift in trend has witnessed an increase in the number of young players being designated as marquee players, coinciding with the growing migration of football players to Australia.
Ayush Ghalan, discovered through a talent hunt in the first edition of the Nepal Super League, has now assumed the role of marquee player for Pokhara Thunders. Similarly, forward Ashish Chaudhary has earned the status of a marquee player for Dhangadhi FC in less than a year after joining the national team. Another young forward, Hisub Thapaliya, holds the marquee player position for Kathmandu Razyrs, while Arik Bista is designated as Butwal Lumbini FC’s marquee player, and goalkeeper Deep Karki assumes the marquee role for Birgunj FC.
Ananta Tamang, who was not a marquee player in the first edition, now holds the position of Lalitpur City FC’s marquee player, taking over from Bimal Gharti Magar, who has relocated to Australia.
Only Anjan Bista and the goalkeeper duo Bishal Shrestha and Bikesh Kuthu, who were marquee players in the first edition, retain their marquee status in the second edition. Shrestha is the marquee for FC Chitwan, Kuthu for Sporting Ilam de Mechi, and Bista for Jhapa FC. Interestingly, three goalkeepers hold the marquee position.
Following the auction, Nawyug Shrestha, the marquee player for Pokhara Thunders in the first edition, and Bharat Khawas, the marquee for FC Chitwan, have joined Sporting Ilam de Mechi for the upcoming season.
Four players who had moved to Australia have returned to Nepal as iconic players. Bimal Gharti Magar is designated as the iconic player for FC Chitwan, Ashish Lama for Butwal Lumbini FC, Tej Tamang for Birgunj United, and Dinesh Rajbanshi for Pokhara Thunders.
Notably, Nepali national team captain Kiran Kumar Limbu and defender Rohit Chand are absent from the Nepal Super League as they are currently engaged in league play with foreign clubs. In the first season, Kiran played for Dhangadhi FC.
Charm of foreign players

In contrast to the first edition, the second edition of the Nepal Super League is witnessing twice the number of foreign players, with a significant presence from African countries. Notably, players with experience in the FIFA World Cup and European leagues are making their way to Nepal this time.
One such player is Afriyie Acquah, a Ghanaian who participated in the FIFA World Cup in Brazil in 2014. Acquah made his World Cup debut as a substitute player in a 2-1 defeat against Portugal.
Unlike the first season, where teams were limited to three foreign players, this time the allowance has been increased to five. With nine participating teams featuring five foreign players each, a total of 45 players are set to participate in the Nepal Super League. More than two-thirds of these players hail from African countries, with additional representation from Europe and Asia.
Many teams have already announced the names of their foreign players, and a majority of them have arrived in Nepal, joined their respective teams, and commenced training.
Former champions Kathmandu Razyrs have secured the services of Tojidinov Komiljon and Shokhrukh Mahmudxojiyev from Uzbekistan, as well as Oliver Kingue and Juan Olivier Simo Kingue from Cameroon. Adding to their international roster, Ghana’s Stephen Abeiku Acquah has been signed as a foreign player.
Lalitpur City has made notable additions to its lineup with the signing of goalkeeper Jeffrey Baltus, French forward Papa Ibou Kebe, and Nigerian defender Omolaja Karim as foreign players. These players bring experience from the second, third, and fourth divisions of football in France. The names of the remaining two foreign players for Lalitpur City have not been disclosed as of now.
Former runner-up Dhangadhi FC has retained Nigerian forward Olawale Afeez Oladipo, who has showcased his talents in Nepali domestic football. Additionally, Dhangadhi FC has added international flair to its roster with the inclusion of Fallou Diagne from Senegal and Trey Williams from England, both of whom have previous experience in European leagues. The team has also secured the services of Lebanese goalkeeper Mohammad Taha and Ghanaian Richard Osei Agyemang, both actively participating in the domestic league.
FC Chitwan has bolstered its squad with notable signings, including Ghanaian players Afriye Azquah and Yussif Mubarik. Additionally, the team has secured the services of Spanish defender Ivan Gonzalez, Ghanaian Rafic Aminu, and Torric Jebrin, who brings World Cup experience to the roster.
Meanwhile, Pokhara Thunders has made significant additions with the signings of Franklin Kute Talla from Cameroon, as well as Ghanaian players Joe Aidoo, Moses Gyabaah Twum, Stephan Joko Paapa Annor, and Yves Priso. These international players are expected to contribute to the team’s performance in the upcoming season.
Butwal Lumbini has made notable signings for the upcoming season, including Stephen Binong from Cameroon, who has been performing well in domestic football in Nepal and was previously with former champions Kathmandu Razyrs. Additionally, the team has secured the services of Cameroon’s defensive midfielder Nicolas Serge Song. The names of other players in the Butwal Lumbini squad are yet to be announced.
Among the new teams, Jhapa FC has made significant signings to strengthen its squad. The team has secured the services of Spanish midfielder Nando Cozar Torres, Uzbekistan’s centre-back Samadar Ochilov, and Serbia’s talented age-group goalkeeper Stefan Cupic. These international players bring diverse skills and experiences, adding depth to Jhapa FC’s lineup for the upcoming Nepal Super League season.
Sporting Ilam de Mechi has secured the signings of Ibrahima Djite, Amath Ndaw, and Abdoulaye Ba from Senegal, along with Fode Camara from Guinea and Suraj Singh from India.
On the other hand, Birgunj United has made notable signings by securing the services of four players from Ghana: William Opoku Asieou, Hans Kwofie, Obed Owusu, and Aikins Kyei Baffour. Additionally, the team has signed Congolese player Tshamala Djadje as a foreign player. These international signings are expected to contribute to Birgunj United’s performance in the upcoming season."

","Gulshan Jha raises his bat after scoring a half-century against Oman in the final of the T20 World Cup Asia Qualifier. 
Throughout the past year, Gulshan Jha has proven his ability to thrive in clutch situations. Whenever Nepal has needed a player to step up, Jha has consistently risen to the occasion.
The recently held T20 World Cup Asia Qualifier is evidence of that. Despiting finishing second, his performance during the tournament was such that he was declared the best Nepali player as the team qualified for the 2024 T20 World Cup which will be held in the US and the West Indies in 2024.
Jha excelled with both the bat and ball. While his career has only just begun, people are already dubbing him Nepal’s perfect all-rounder.
Standing out

Gulshan Jha made a name for himself during the Mayor’s Cup in 2020. His performance with the ball in hand against the Armed Police Force during the final caught a lot of attention as he helped Nepal Police win the tournament.
Since then there has been no looking back for Jha. He has played a significant role in all the achievements of the Nepali cricket team over the last year. From winning 11 out of 12 matches in the ICC World Cup Cricket League 2 to facing formidable teams like India and Pakistan in the Asia Cup, Jha has made noteworthy contributions.
Even with limited appearances in ODI and T20 matches, he has already showcased his calibre as an all-rounder. His performances in the Tri-Series Nation and the final of the final for the T20 World Cup Qualifier have demonstrated that he is equally adept as an all-rounder in T20 cricket.
In the T20 World Cup Qualifier, Jha scored 79 runs in five matches, including one half-century, despite playing only three innings. His standout performance came in the final against Oman, where he scored an impressive 54 runs off just 25 balls, contributing significantly to Nepal’s respectable total of 184.
Despite picking up only five wickets, Jha shown with the ball in hand has he kept troubling the batters with pace and bounce.
“It feels great to have won the best Nepali player. I am just happy to have helped the team get to the World Cup,” he says.
Following the footsteps
Gulshan Jha celebrates taking the wicket of Aqyb Ilyas in the final of the T20 World Cup Qualifier in Kathmandu on November 5, 2023. 
He recalls watching the T20 World Cup in Bangladesh and being inspired by the performances of Paras Khadka, Gyanendra Malla, and Sharad Vesawkar. According to him, they played a crucial role in motivating him to pursue a career in cricket.
“I wanted to be them. Sometimes it feels surreal that I am one of them now,” he says.
Gulshan Jha is aware of the expectations and pressure placed on him, understanding that he must consistently develop and enhance his skills as a cricketer. Recognising the dynamic and competitive nature of the sport, he is committed to ongoing growth and improvement to meet the demands and challenges of the game.
He performed admirably during the ODI World Cup Qualifier in Zimbabwe and received praise from former cricketing greats.
“Gulshan is a special talent. Although he is in the early stage of his career he has already played significant innings in T20Is and ODIs,” says former cricketer Sharad Vesawkar, former cricketer. “Currently, there is good team management and in the future things will improve more.”  
Vesawkar believes Jha has all the qualities to be one of the best all-rounders Nepal has ever seen and emulate the great Paras Khadka.
“He is a legend and the best. He is one of the reasons why cricket in Nepal is where it is today. I hope to emulate him but I understand he is unparalleled,” he says.
Jha expresses his commitment to fulfilling the responsibilities assigned by the coach. He is actively working on improving both his batting and bowling skills.
“I am giving my best to be a better all-rounder.” 
Big match player
Gulshan Jha after hitting the winning runs against the UAE during the ICC Men’s Cricket World Cup League 2 in Kathmandu on March 16. 
Gulshan Jha has proven to be a big-match player, delivering all-round performances in both ODI and T20 formats.
In the final match of ICC Cricket World Cup League 2, he won Nepal the game single-handedly by scoring an unbeaten 50 against the UAE. He has proven to be the UAE’s nemesis as he helped Nepal beat them in the ACC Premier Cup final with an unbeaten 67 to take Nepal to the Asia Cup. 
Jha has been consistent even in T20Is. In the T20 World Cup Asia Qualifier, he made significant contributions with the bat. His aggressive batting against Oman at TU Cricket Ground in Kirtipur played a pivotal role in Nepal posting 184 runs.
Nepal faced a challenging start, managing only 60 runs and losing four wickets in the initial 10 overs. However, Jha’s entry into the batting lineup marked a turning point for Nepal. Jha’s 78-run partnership with captain Rohit Paudel settled the innings as Nepal posted a competitive total. Jha finished with 54 runs off 25 balls, achieving his first half-century.
Former cricketer Vesawkar says that despite having played only around 15 T20I matches, Jha has already showcased significant potential.
“Gulshan has been playing well in pressure situations. I feel we have unearthed a gem,” says Vesawkar. “Now we should focus on improving him and make sure he is not overworked and is free from injuries.”"

FIFA World Cup Qualifier: Nepal humbled by UAE
","Pankaj Bikram Nembang
Pankaj Bikram Nembang, the president of the All Nepal Football Association, dodged a bullet on November 9. Nembang, who faced a vote of confidence, came through unscathed. However, the road ahead is challenging, as he is destined to encounter tough tests while continuing to lead Nepali football.
Nembang was elected the president of ANFA on June 21, 2022, after defeating former president Karma Tsering Sherpa by six votes. A challenging year later, he faced near removal from ANFA as members expressed dissatisfaction with his perceived failure to effectively lead Nepali football.
Despite having multiple plans, Pankaj Bikram Nembang has struggled to execute them as intended. On the day of the oath-taking ceremony, he appointed a general secretary and treasurer without a predefined agenda, sparking controversy. This gradually snowballed as a majority of members, led by Karma Tsering Sherpa, on September 11 submitted a written application to dismiss Nembang and general secretary Kiran Rai.
Pankaj Bikram Nembang is the first ANFA president to face a vote of confidence.
According to Article 36 of ANFA’s statute, there is a provision for convening a special general convention. If 40 per cent of the members submit a written request for such a convention, the working committee is obligated to organize it within a 30-day timeframe.
On October 4, an emergency meeting of the ANFA working committee called for a special general meeting on November 9, with the sole agenda of removing Nembang.
Same old ANFA
Pankaj Bikram Nembang and Kiran Rai.
The meeting was held in Hetauda. Before the voting could take place, Nembang addressed the ANFA members. When those who filed for his removal asked to speak, they were denied. That sparked further fury as the disgruntled faction led by former ANFA president Sherpa decided to leave the meeting and not take part in the voting at all.
“They did not let us speak. They did not follow the regulations. There was no point in staying in the meeting,” says Karma Tsiring Sherpa.
Sherpa contends that voting proceeded without the approval of the agenda. Nevertheless, the voting was carried out. Out of the 107 members of ANFA, 87 hold voting rights but 34 abstained from the voting process. That meant only 53 members cast votes, and of those, 52 votes were deemed valid. Notably, all the votes were in favour of Nembang staying in office as ANFA president.
“He has saved his post. But this shows how things in ANFA will never change. There are many challenges Pankaj has to face. I don’t see the situation changing as he will face even more scrutiny,” says an ANFA central member on the condition of anonymity.
Challenging future
R-L: Karma Tsering Sherpa and Pankaj Bikram Nembang, ANFA presidency aspirants
Upon being elected as president, Pankaj Bikram Nembang expressed his commitment to treating everyone equally, ensuring financial transparency, and establishing a women’s football academy. Additionally, he stated that during his tenure, Nepal would secure victory in the SAFF Championship and initiate the national league.
However, up to this point, he has not fulfilled these promises. The Martyr’s Memorial ‘A’ Division League that he organised faced numerous issues. Failing to conduct the B Division and C Division, along with the inability to organise the second round of the National Women’s League and the Lalit Memorial U19 competition, has been another setback. 
The performance of both the men’s and women’s teams has been subpar, leading to a significant number of national footballers leaving the country, with many relocating to Australia. This has resulted in a deterioration of the structure and strength of the national football team.
The Nepali football’s governing body is currently entangled in internal conflicts, and even the special meeting failed to address these issues. In this challenging situation, Nembang must engage in effective collaboration with the disgruntled group to navigate through the prevalent conflicts.
“He should improve the relationship with everyone,” says a central member of ANFA. “Now the leagues should be organised and financial transparency should be maintained, otherwise there will be trouble.”
ANFA knows that the upcoming days will be challenging. Suresh Shah, the spokesperson has called for calm and asked everyone to come together for the betterment of Nepali football.
“We should not be fighting amongst ourselves. That will kill Nepali football. We should work together to develop Nepali football. For that, ANFA is always up for a rational discussion with anyone,” says Shah.
Sherpa, the leader of the dissident group, insists that ANFA should adhere to the established rules and regulations, emphasising the need for efficient management within the football sector.
 “We will support ANFA if they will work properly,” says Sherpa. 
Nevertheless, with Pankaj Bikram Nembang still in charge, one can expect that Nepali football is poised to encounter further drama."

","Over the past decade, cricket in Nepal has overtaken football to be the country’s most beloved sport. In a nation beset by political strife, internal unrest, economic instability, and natural disasters like earthquakes and accidents, it is only natural for cricket to provide a sense of joy and excitement to its populace. Cricket in Nepal has proven to be a unifying force among the youth, bridging divides of caste, region, and religion. 
According to Joseph Nye, a professor at Harvard University, the term ‘soft power’ refers to a country’s ability to attract and influence others without resorting to force or coercion. This definition can be found in his book titled ‘Soft Power: The Means to Succeed in World Politics’, published in 2004. 
This article aims to spotlight the current developments in cricket in Nepal, using examples from various countries. It also delves into the government’s stance towards the sport and explores potential opportunities for diplomatic connections.
Latest development in cricket
The Nepal cricket team celebrate after winning the ACC Men’s Premier Cup, in Kathmandu, on May 2, 2023.
Cricket in Nepal has achieved a notable feat by earning a spot in the 2024 T20 World Cup in the US and the West Indies, thanks to their impressive performance during a match held on their home turf. After a decade-long pursuit, their aspiration of reaching the World Cup has finally come to fruition, having gained valuable experience from their participation in the 2014 event.
Nepalis still hold dear the memory of Nepal’s victory over Afghanistan in 2014. Soon, cricket enthusiasts in Nepal will once again have the opportunity to take on the best in the world and share special memories.
Our head coach, Monti Desai, has played a crucial role in securing Nepal’s ODI recognition. He mentored and coached the Nepali team to an impressive 11 out of 12 victories in the Cricket World Cup League and was integral as Nepal qualified for the Asia Cup where they took on Asian heavyweights India and Pakistan.
What stands out the most is how he facilitated valuable interactions between Indian and Nepali players, greatly boosting the morale of the Nepali team. Thanks to his guidance, Nepal once again secured qualification for the World Cup.
During this, Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal has also displayed unwavering support for players during big tournaments. He recently distributed the cash prizes that the government had pledged, as he has consistently reiterated his commitment to being an instigator for the development of cricket in Nepal.
In line with the progress of cricket in Nepal, the government has expressed its commitment to completing the construction of the Mulpani Cricket Ground and to building stadiums in Chitwan and Biratnagar as part of the national pride project.”

When discussing cricket development, it is essential to consider how the sport has evolved and continues to progress in India, Australia, and England.
In India, cricket has united a diverse nation for decades. The Indian cricket team is a merit-based team that attracts talent from across the country, regardless of nepotism or favouritism. Cricket has served as a powerful tool for India to showcase its national identity and rich culture, while also facilitating the growth of economic and cultural relationships with other nations. The Indian Premier League (IPL) is a prime illustration of this, having played a significant role in bolstering India’s appeal to foreign investments and tourism.
Cricket, a sport that originated in the United Kingdom, is dominated by India. India is home to the Global Cricket Academy, and the Board for Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) is currently the richest cricket board in the world. The net worth of the International Cricket Council (ICC) is just over USD 2.5 billion, whereas the BCCI’s net worth is USD 2.25 billion.
Australia’s rich history in cricket has helped the country promote its sporting prowess and welcoming image. Cricket Australia is the second richest cricket board at USD 70 million. The Australian cricket team has dominated world cricket as it has time and again displayed its ruthless aggression and winning spirit.
A widely held belief is that cricket was introduced to India during British colonial rule. As British interests expanded globally, the sport spread to other countries. The passion and adoration English fans have for cricket is truly a sight to behold. In an era when test cricket is facing challenges, the way English supporters flock to stadiums across the country to watch their team play is commendable and serves as an inspiration for cricket fans around the world.
Importance of soft power and role of cricket

The British Brand Finance Institute has determined that the US currently holds the top position for soft power among 128 countries worldwide. Following closely behind is the UK in second, Germany in third, China in fourth and Japan in fifth. Additionally, India has impressively improved their ranking from 36th to 28th place compared to the previous year.
The utilisation of cricket as a diplomatic tool or a means of exerting soft power has gained increasing significance in today’s world. Nepal currently holds the 15th position in the ICC’s ODI rankings and 16th position in the T20 rankings. By employing cricket diplomacy, Nepal has the potential to enhance its national image and elevate its global standing. Here are five strategies through which Nepal can capitalise on its cricketing strength:
1. Host international cricket events – Nepal can host cricketing events of international significance, such as the Asia Cup or a tri-series with neighbouring countries, to bring attention to the country’s infrastructure, development, and hospitality, in addition to its cultural attractions. This would not only showcase the country’s cricketing talent but also its capacity to organise large-scale events.
2. Engage with the international cricket community – Furthermore, leveraging cricket as a vehicle for social initiatives, such as advocating for education, health awareness, or gender equality, can attest to Nepal’s unwavering commitment to social advancement while simultaneously enhancing its international standing. This can entail collaborating with NGOs and other organizations to champion social causes and harnessing cricket events to raise awareness and generate funding.
3. Promote Nepali cricketers as role models – Highlighting the accomplishments of Nepali cricketers can inspire young Nepalis and project a positive image of the country’s potential and talent in sports.
4. Encourage grassroots cricket development – Expanding the reach of cricket and creating opportunities for underprivileged youth can be achieved through investing in grassroots cricket development, particularly in rural areas. Nepal’s commitment to inclusive development is evident in the potential of constructing cricket pitches and training facilities in remote regions, as well as providing coaching and support to budding cricketers. By doing so, we can empower young people with the skills and confidence to pursue their dreams and contribute to their communities.
5. Cricket diplomacy to strengthen ties with neighbouring countries– Cricket diplomacy can be employed as the fifth strategy to enhance Nepal’s international standing and foster regional cooperation with neighbouring countries like India and Bangladesh. Joint cricket events and initiatives can be organized with neighbouring countries, and cricket can be effectively used as a means for cultural exchange and cooperation.
By actively implementing these strategies, Nepal can showcase itself as a vibrant, welcoming, and sports-loving nation while projecting a positive image of its cultural heritage, youth potential, and commitment to social progress."

In 2023, Barbie named Women in Sports as their career of the year.
Whenever I am out and about socially, there is always someone who seems pretty certain about not considering my profession as mainstream. Hold up! Sports as a career? In Nepal? You bet! This article aims to explain why women in this male-dominant sports industry in Nepal should not be viewed as a surprise.
I have been part of the Nepali cricket industry in a private capacity for quite a while now. Armed with a Master’s Degree in IT from an American University, my choice to stick with sports management tends to raise eyebrows. While I am not an on-field player, I am definitely behind the scenes, playing strong games of serious deliverance with my team. We are all about creating what is not there.
As untouched and less discussed as the sports management industry is in Nepal, it has ample room to showcase creativity. Being a commanding woman in a position can be challenging, but on the brighter side, the gender advantage has yet to fail me. As alien as I might be in sports management in Nepal, I have been accepted with open arms. The nature of the job is highly competitive, no doubt.

Women in sports are safe, heard, and welcomed. I absolutely relish the addition of spirited women to the team. The nuances of sports are something women complement greatly. Sports management inherently rejects narrow minds. There is a lot of travelling, meeting people, experimenting, and remembering limitations. The adjustments are both trivial and clever. 
Often, in our part of the world, societal norms limit women from making career decisions, hindering them from living life on their terms. This restriction potentially keeps many capable women from pursuing the sports industry, where they could truly wield their power to make an impact. Change is gradual, and I hope to see numerous female faces in charge of stadiums someday in Nepal.
Yes, there are challenges. It ranges from personal sacrifices to job security and opportunities. However, these are workable factors for any freelancer in sports management. The key is excelling at our jobs to thrive anywhere. 
Taking a page from the medical field, the seriousness we apply there should not differ in sports management. Sports is a powerful industry. Children grow up idolising what we showcase on TV. As glorious as the game is, it is every child’s dream to represent their country someday. Carrying that responsibility is our role in sports—an often thankless yet deeply satisfying job.
Nepali sports industry
The fans went wild at TU Cricket Ground after Nepal beat UAE.
Sports may be a smaller industry in Nepal, but globally, it is a behemoth. The world economy has shifted, and it is time we alter our perspective to recognise the potential of sports as an industry in Nepal. The idea of open commercialisation of sports remains somewhat unexplored, as it continues to be a more exclusive affair in Nepal. 
By sourcing innovative ideas, there’s a wealth of public attention and investment waiting to be tapped into, along with numerous practices to establish and discard. As the Nepali team achieves international records, the packaging of the sport becomes everything. There is plenty to learn from international sports management to make our industry highly marketable and poised for global entry.
Sports such as cricket, football, volleyball, or even golf serve as key intersections for reshaping Nepal’s global narrative. Over the years, Kabaddi has witnessed a substantial surge in India, both in terms of viewership and commercial success. The primary challenge we grapple with is Nepal’s comparatively small market size, posing constraints on our ability to generate substantial economic gains. Therefore, there is unanimous agreement on the imperative for Nepal’s sports to venture onto the international stage.
Nepal boasts many hardworking individuals, yet achieving this goal demands specialised talents in sports management with the requisite experience and the capacity to enhance existing values. In the long run, outsourcing such talents may foster dependence. Hence, a concerted effort is needed to inspire Nepali youth to engage in sports management, contributing to our sports ecosystem. 
There are various ways in which we can harness the potential of sports for our benefit. Encouraging youth involvement can be instrumental in capitalising on the multifaceted opportunities presented by the sports industry. There is a lot to explore if you think about it."

","Painting ‘My Private Life’ by artist Priyam Pradhan at the exhibition Mani at Siddhartha Art Gallery, Baber Mahal. Photo: Chandra Bahadur Ale
Using Pitt’s artist pen on paper, artist Priyam Pradhan presents My Private Life, a showcase of the current significance of his life depicted in abstract form.
At the centre of the painting is a 1000-rupee note, within which Pradhan has intricately painted Lord Krishna, a man wearing a hoodie tenderly embracing his dog, and a woman. The woman stands tall, elongated in form. Towards the bottom of the canvas, a holy man reaches out his hands, appearing to be in flight.
Priyam Pradhan has used a vibrant colour palette, incorporating bright hues such as pink, orange, and yellow, as well as green, black, white, and grey. This combination adds a dynamic and lively quality to the artwork.
“The man in the centre is me and the girl in green is my girlfriend. And the faces are my mom and dad,” says Pradhan. “The sadhu (holy man) symbolises my desires that I don’t have many desires for materialistic things however I do understand the value of money.”
The use of colours, figures and lines in an abstract form in his painting resembles the painting of American painter Paul Jackson Pollock. Like his abstract expressionism, Pradhan has expressed himself in his painting.
Furthermore, this marks Priyam Pradhan’s third solo painting exhibition titled Mani (money), inaugurated on January 17 at Siddhartha Art Gallery, Baber Mahal.
In his previous exhibitions, Pradhan’s artworks centred around Hindu philosophy and his spontaneous thought process. However, in this latest exhibition, he explores the theme of money and its impact on an individual’s life, delving into the reverberating effects of financial aspects.
Understanding the value of money

Any form of art is known as a reflection of the contemporary time. Likewise, Priyam Pradhan’s paintings reflect the lifestyle, desires, obligations and more of today’s younger generation living in urban areas in Nepal.
Pradhan himself is in his 20s and he has justified the want of most of the youngsters in their 20s, who might be declared adults and understand the need for money and materialistic things but are still kids at their heart who want to explore and experience life as much as possible.
The exhibition has 27 paintings which Pradhan took around nine months to complete. According to him, while he was travelling the idea that his life was luxurious and him being capable of exploring anything he wanted to was because of money.
And being an artist this concept lingered on him and he was compelled to create on the theme of money.
Once you enter the gallery, you can also view an animated video, which introduces artist Pradhan and the importance of money, which is on the ground floor. On the first floor, a huge painting (193×62 in cm) Apatkalin Awastha using mixed media on canvas welcomes you and other paintings are small in size (18×30 in cm).
“It is a team work and it is my introduction as an artist for the exhibition,” he says. “Also, being a recent multimedia graduate from Islington College, I wanted to explore my skills and I got my team. Then, like money, multimedia is relevant to current society.”
Experiencing life through art
Painting by artist Priyam Pradhan at Siddhartha Art Gallery, Baber Mahal. Photo: Chandra Bahadur Ale 
Priyam Pradhan says enjoyment is the meaning of life and he enjoys creating artwork. Moreover, Pradhan who came into the art world first being a tattoo artist feels blessed that he has the privilege to explore whatever he likes in his life.
He also believes that the philosophy that says one should not be materialistic is wrong. “If material things are not important, why would one build a house? And after building a house why do they want to decorate their house?” he questions.
Alongside, money and materialistic things, his paintings also explore love, romance, life and childhood experiences. Motifs like Pokemon, ramen noodles, animals, dancers, etc have been used in his paintings. In most of his paintings, he has used numerous white lines in wavy form and these lines for Pradhan indicate the sound or the energy that exists in the surroundings all the time.
About using a pitta artist pen, he says, “I have enjoyed drawing and painting since my childhood and using a pitta artist pen helps me revisit that feeling of happiness and sense of freedom.”
So many things happening on the canvas with the use of vibrant colours gives a sense of excitement to the viewers. Though referencing artists like Pollock, MF Husain, Picasso and more, his pen strokes give a sense of newness through his expression and thoughts about his life experiences.
In his paintings, these bright colours and motifs are in harmony and are visual treats that can surely cheer up the mood of any visitor. Moreover, you can also get free stickers from the artist.
If you too are in a gloomy mood and want to uplift a little, visit the exhibition that continues till February 6."

In the shadow of the towering Himalayas, Nepal faces a challenge that rivals the steepness of its mountainous terrain- the challenge of economic development. As the nation earnestly pursues its Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), it becomes increasingly evident that a transformation in the education system is not only necessary but also urgent. 
Rooted in common living strategies, the prevailing education model, especially in higher education, may not adequately prepare the youth for the demands of the modern world. 
In this critical juncture, the incorporation of entrepreneurship education emerges as a beacon of hope, offering a pathway towards a self-reliant and prosperous Nepal.
Time to reevaluate the education system
Nepal’s journey towards economic prosperity has been marked by challenges that demand innovative solutions. The commitment of the SDGs reflects not only a global responsibility but also a domestic imperative for sustainable development. For this, it is high time to reevaluate the education system in the country.
The current education system in Nepal, deeply entrenched in common living strategies, has been the foundation of learning for generations. However, in the face of a rapidly evolving world, today’s generation aspires for more than the status quo. The call for independence reverberates through the aspirations of youth who seek a curriculum fostering critical thinking, innovation and entrepreneurial skills.
Entrepreneurship education is a dynamic force capable of reshaping Nepal’s educational landscape. This innovative approach moves beyond traditional learning methods, providing students with the tools to navigate the complexities of the modern world. At its core, entrepreneurship education is about empowering students to implement learned information in practical and tangible ways.
Consider a student engrossed in the intricacies of sensor systems during a science class, entrepreneurship education transforms this theoretical knowledge into practical applications, inspiring the creation of a sensor-operated door. Such innovation born from a fusion of science and entrepreneurship becomes a valuable mindset in solving practical problems.  
Expanding the horizons of entrepreneurship education, let us delve into chemistry. Imagine students studying chemistry not just as a theoretical subject, but also as entrepreneurs in the making. Armed with entrepreneurial principles, these students can tap into Nepal’s rich biodiversity, exploring market demands for products derived from local plants.
In the scenario, chemistry students could embark on a journey to develop performance-enhancing products based on market demand, harnessing the potential of indigenous flora. What makes this approach remarkable is that it does not necessarily require sophisticated machines or extensive human resources. Instead, it leverages the inherent skills and awareness of individuals within the community, paving the way for a grassroots economic revolution.
Entrepreneurship in education

The beauty of entrepreneurship education lies in its universal applicability. It is not confined to science or chemistry alone. Consider an art student, for example. Through entrepreneurship education, they can understand what art to develop (product), how much to set the price (price), where to sell (place) and how to sell (promote) their artworks. Every subject becomes a canvas for innovation and enterprise.
Moreover, entrepreneurship education is a powerful equaliser, recognising the unique skills and talents of individuals across various disciplines. It is not about fitting into a predefined mould but rather about unleashing the potential within each student. When every single person is aware of their skills and potential, they can rise to different levels, contributing to the overall progress of the nation.
Entrepreneurship education goes beyond skill recognition; it is about nurturing the ability to produce goods and mastering the art of marketing. Returning to the example of the student developing a sensor-operated door, entrepreneurship education not only equips them to produce the product but also teaches them how to navigate the complexities of marketing it to potential users and clients.
The impact of entrepreneurship education extends beyond individual success stories; it reverberates through the entire nation. A generation equipped with entrepreneurial skills becomes a driving force for economic growth and independence. They will be able to recognise the resources and ideas to utilise them to reach the global market. They will be able to be the pioneers in products and contribute to the economy. By fostering a culture of innovation, creativity and self-reliance, Nepal can reduce its dependence on external sources and strengthen its economy from within.
In essence, entrepreneurship education is not just an investment in the education system; it is an investment in the nation’s future prosperity. It is a transformative force that has the potential to shape a generation of independent thinkers, innovators and entrepreneurs- the architects of a self-reliant and economically vibrant Nepal. Entrepreneurship education, by teaching students to utilise available resources (physical and financial) and make them commercial, becomes a cornerstone in the nation’s journey towards economic empowerment and independence."

Role of entrepreneurship education in Nepal’s quest for economic empowerment 
","Ram Bujhaun Yadav with his land ownership certificate stands near a border pillar which he says was erroneously placed on his land. 
In October 2023, when 51-year-old Ram Bujhaun Yadav of Musaharnia Rural Municipality-5, Mukhiyapatti, Dhanusha, was at a relative’s house, someone told him that two Indian Sashastra Seema Bal (SSB) personnel were looking for him.
Anxious, he rushed home wondering why they were looking for him.
“They asked me if the paddy field in the no man’s land was mine. I told them yes and they asked me to cut down the paddy immediately,” he said.
The paddy was not ripe and Yadav asked them for some time. However, the SSB personnel told him he had to cut down his paddy immediately.
Ram Bujhaun and his wife Tetari Devi each own a 677-square-metre plot of land. As Nepal and India reevaluated the border, Ram Bujhan’s land was been deemed to be near the no man’s land as it now has two demarcation pillars.
Frustrated, Ram Bujhaun cut the paddy before it was due to be harvested. Now, he has been asked to not plant anything on the land as it falls in the no man’s land.
“Our border police don’t say a word. I can’t fight the SSB on my own,” says Ram Bujhaun adding he had decided not to plan anything on the land anymore.
Woes of the farmers
Many farmers in southern Nepal say their land has now been placed in India after the recent demarcation. 
When the Jamuna River, which flows through the no man’s land between Nepal and India, changed its course some two decades ago, some border pillars went missing. Locals say these pillars have now been placed encroaching on Nepali land.
In 2018, with the then Chief District Officer of Dhanusha, Pradeep Raj Kandel, and an official from Madhubani district, Bihar, India, a team that included border security forces from both countries, the Armed Police Force of Nepal, and SSB of India began placing border pillars after land measurement by technicians.
Locals have raised concerns, stating that border pillars have been positioned, encroaching approximately 50 to 100 meters of land into Nepal compared to the previous position. Many like Ram Bujhaun are unaware of when these border pillars were placed.
“I did not know that pillar was placed here. After I found out when I asked the village leaders, many said they were placing the border pillars as they pleased,” said Ram Bujhaun.
He was told to carry on planting paddy and that it would not matter as these issues had happened in the past. 
“They encroached on my land and have asked me not to plant anything. This is gross injustice,” he says.
Ram Bujhaun’s family owns a total of 4,000 square metres of land, with 2,000 square metres belonging to him and the remaining 2,000 square metres to his brother Bechan. However, 1,000 square metres of his land is now located on the Indian side after the demarcation. Despite this, he has been farming on the land and continues to pay taxes to the Department of Land Management and Archive in Nepal.
“They have marked my land to be on the Indian side and placed border pillars on it. I’ve been farming till now but I don’t know when they will ask me to stop,” he says.
Ignorance of the government
The Madhesh province in southern Nepal
The former ward chair of Mukhiyapatti Musharniya Rural Municipality-5, Ram Naresh Yadav, said that over time, India has encroached on numerous Nepali lands in various locations in the Madhesh Province. This, he says, happened due to the Nepali administration’s ignorance and weak stature.
“They (Nepali administration) were careless and that meant the Indian side placed these border pillars by encroaching on Nepali land,” says Ram Naresh.
He said that over 40 farmers from wards 1, 5, and 6 have land ranging from 300 to 1,600 square metres on the Indian side. 
“These farmers have land ownership certificates, but they cannot farm as the SSB says the land is in India and not Nepal,” said Ram Naresh.
In 1996, land ownership certificates were distributed after surveying the land in the border area. Local Dharmendra Kumar Yadav said that since then, the locals have been paying their land tax regularly. In 2018, when the pillar was being placed, the locals protested when they saw their land was being encroached on. However, since the demarcation had been agreed upon by high-ranking government officials of Nepal and India, the farmer’s voices went unheard.
“We tried to stop when the border pillars were being placed on our land. But the administrators from both sides forcibly put it there without even trying to hold a discussion,” said Harish Chandra Yadav. 
The Chief District Officer of Dhanusha, Chakrapani Pandey, says that the border pillars were placed by the technical team after the measurements and with the agreement of the high-ranking officials of the two countries.
“The fields and houses that are built in no man’s land have recently been cleared. No one can do anything in this particular area,” said Pandey. “We understand the people’s concern but we cannot do anything about it now.”"

","Regenerative braking representational image. Photo: Freepik
The electric vehicle market in Nepal has grown significantly over the past year. 
Electric four-wheelers and two-wheelers are being launched almost every month, spanning from passenger to commercial vehicles. Electric transportation appears to be an emerging trend in the automotive industry.
New EVs are regularly introduced with advanced features as car companies develop unique electric platforms. One standout feature is regenerative braking.
Regenerative braking was first introduced in 1967 by the American Motor Car Company (AMC) in their prototype electric vehicle, the AMC Amitron. However, Toyota became the automobile manufacturer to implement regenerative braking system (RBS) technology in their Prius series hybrid vehicles in 1997. Toyota brought up the new hybrid technology in the Prius when fuel prices were going up at a massive rate.

But what is regenerative braking? There are still many people confused about what it is, whether it is safe or helpful in fuel economy in hybrid cars and the regeneration of electricity in electric cars.
In simple terms, regen braking is when a car saves energy by recharging its battery when you brake, helping it use less fuel or electricity and go further. Easy but scientifically, regen braking is a process used in vehicles where the kinetic energy produced during braking is converted into electrical energy through an electric motor acting as a generator. This electrical energy is then stored in the vehicle’s battery for later use, reducing energy wastage and increasing overall efficiency.

Regen braking can be seen in all kinds of EVs, including cars, scooters, commercial vans, buses, bicycles, three-wheelers, and rickshaws. It now can be electrically managed to what extent the power and braking can be generated. 
Regenerative Braking work process in EV

Principle of Operation: Regene braking works by turning the energy from slowing down into electricity.
Electric Motor as a Generator: In EV or hybrid cars with regen braking, the motor changes roles from moving the car to making electricity when you brake.
Switching Polarity: When you brake, the motor switches directions, turning energy from the wheels into electricity instead of using it to move the car.
Generation of Electricity: The turning wheels make the motor produce electricity, which goes to the car’s battery.
Power Electronics: Special electronics change the electricity from the motor into the right kind for charging the battery.
Battery Charging: The electricity made during braking charges up the car’s battery, storing the energy for later.
Integration with Hydraulic Braking System: Regenerative braking works with the regular brakes, blending them for smooth stopping.

Advantages and Disadvantages of Regenerative Braking 
The advantages are listed below:

Energy Efficiency: Regenerative braking efficiently captures the kinetic energy generated during braking, effectively reducing energy wastage and contributing to a more sustainable driving experience.
Extended Range: By using the energy that would otherwise be lost during braking as heat and sound, regenerative braking helps to extend the driving range of electric vehicles in instances such as travelling downhill. 
Reduced Brake Wear: Regenerative braking minimizes the strain on traditional braking components, mitigating wear and tear, and potentially extending the lifespan of the braking components such as brake pads, rotors and brake lines, thus reducing maintenance costs over time.
Enhanced Driving Experience: Regenerative braking provides a smoother braking experience and a more responsive feel to drivers, enhancing overall driving comfort and control on the road.

The disadvantages are listed below:

Limited Effectiveness at Low Speeds: While regenerative braking efficiently recaptures energy during braking, its effectiveness diminishes at lower speeds which leads to decreased energy recovery compared to higher speeds.
Complexity and Cost: Implementing regenerative braking adds complexity and cost to vehicle systems, potentially raising manufacturing and maintenance expenses, and impacting consumer affordability.
Maintenance Requirements: Regenerative braking systems require periodic maintenance and calibration to ensure they operate optimally.
Efficiency Variability: Regenerative braking may exhibit variability in efficiency under extreme weather conditions or on certain road surfaces, leading to fluctuations in overall energy recapture and impacting the vehicle’s efficiency.

Misconceptions

Fully Recharges Battery: Some mistakenly believe that regenerative braking fully replenishes the battery, but in reality, it only adds a modest amount of charge.
Increases Braking Distances: There is a misconception that regenerative braking extends braking distances, but it enhances braking performance by complementing traditional brakes.
High-Speed Only: While more effective at higher speeds, regenerative braking still functions at lower speeds, such as during city driving or stop-and-go traffic.
Maintenance-Free: Despite requiring less maintenance than traditional brakes, regen braking systems still need periodic checks and maintenance to ensure proper operation.
Significantly Boosts Range: While regen braking contributes to extending the driving range of electric vehicles, its impact is influenced by various factors beyond just braking efficiency.
Only for Electric Cars: Although commonly associated with electric vehicles, regen braking systems are also found in some conventional vehicles, particularly those aiming to improve fuel efficiency with advanced technology.

Regenerative braking might sound complicated, but it is pretty cool. Think of it as a way for EVs and hybrids to recycle energy when they slow down. Instead of just wasting that energy, regenerative braking turns it into electricity, which can then be used to power the battery."

As the gates to the vet clinic at the Central Zoo in Lalitpur opened, more than two dozen photojournalists thronged the facility and surrounded a metal cage aiming their DSLR cameras at a snow leopard inside.
“Please don’t come close to the animal,” the zoo’s vet, Radha Krishna Gharti, told approaching photojournalists. But in the gush of excitement to take exclusive photographs of the elusive cat, difficult to spot even in its prime habitats, there were few takers for the word of caution.
Nepal’s Department of National Parks and Wildlife Conservation (DNPWC) organised the photo-op two days after the male subadult cat, which was until recently found in the country only at altitudes higher than 2,000-6,000 metres above sea level, was brought to the zoo from Urlabari town(146 m above sea level). According to the department, the animal has sustained injuries to its right foreleg and cannot stand upright.
Although officials involved said they are looking at releasing the animal into the wild after it recuperates, doing so will be a daunting task, adding that the zoo may be the only place where it can now survive.
Not a wild cat

“Nepali snow leopard experts have come up with two hypotheses to explain how the animal from the mountains landed up in the plains,” said Sharad Chandra Adhikari, member-secretary at the National Trust for Nature Conservation (NTNC), a semi-government body that manages the zoo in Lalitpur, a town in the Kathmandu Valley. 
The first of the two hypotheses made public during the photo-op-cum-press conference, is that it was raised in captivity and somehow managed to escape into the wild. The second is that it lost its orientation while trying to establish its territory after separating from its mother.
Kulbhushansingh Suryawanshi, director of the India program, Snow Leopard Trust, said that both hypotheses are plausible explanations as to how the snow leopard got to the plains in Nepal.
A DNPWC official, who wished to remain anonymous as he is not authorised to talk to the press, said that it was more likely that the animal had been raised in captivity. 
“The way it sipped the water and ate the food zoo staff offered indicates that it may have been raised in captivity,” the official said.
Snow leopards are shy cats living at extreme altitudes in the steep mountainous areas of 12 countries in Central and South Asia. Their global population spread over altitudes of 500-5,800 m, is estimated to be between around 3,900 and 6,000 as detailed coordinated surveys of the population in the range countries are yet to be carried out. In Nepal, their population divided into three blocks (eastern, central and western) is estimated to be between 301 and 400.
Adhikari from NTNC said that researchers will now examine the animal’s scat to analyse its diet and try to find out whether it was roaming in the wild or had been in some sort of captivity. Researchers are also preparing to analyse its genes to try to find out to which of the three metapopulations in Nepal it belongs. They will also observe the animal’s canine teeth and fur to look for clues.
Relocation challenge

The whole process could take a few months to complete, and summer could set in in Kathmandu by then, officials concede. 
“The current temperature in Kathmandu is suitable for snow leopards, as we are in the peak of winter,” said Madhu Chetri, a snow leopard researcher from NTNC. But that could change as spring season begins in the Northern Hemisphere.
The DNPWC official said that regardless of the findings related to how the animal got to Urlabarli, the animal would have spent a significant amount of time with humans during its recovery phase. “That would mean that it would have gotten habituated with having humans around,” the official said.
Sending such animals back into the wild is a challenge, as they may have lost their hunting and other adaptation skills, he added. In May last year, officials at the Chitwan National Park released two rescued rhino calves into the wild, with limited success. The safety of the animals, which had gotten used to having humans around, was compromised as poachers could easily approach and kill them. Eventually, they were transferred to an enclosure in eastern Nepal away from human intervention.
Veteran conservationist Professor Karan Bahadur Shah said that rewilding the snow leopard would be a daunting task, as the animals are territorial. “If we just leave the animal in its natural habitat, it will get killed by other snow leopards defending their territory,” he said. “The best option would be to keep the animal in the zoo for the public to see.”
But Nepal’s Central Zoo has its own set of problems. The facility, established in 1932 as a private collection, has limited space and has frequently run into financial trouble. Conservationists say the snow leopard would need special facilities to cater to its needs.
“If the government decides that the snow leopard needs to remain at the zoo, we are ready to shoulder the responsibility,” said Adhikari. “We have set up special facilities for animals such as the red panda and chimpanzees,” he said. “We can do that for the snow leopard as well.”
Those advocating for keeping the animal in the zoo also said that Nepal is a snow leopard range country and the public, especially the young generation, also needs to see the different animals found in the country. “It has great educational value,” said Shah.
Snow leopard expert Suryawanshi from neighbouring India also said that it would be challenging to release the animal into the wild. 
“If the team at the zoo can establish the exact cause of this behaviour [why it ventured into the plains] and can keep the animal away from human contact, then it might be okay to release it back,” he said. “But otherwise, there is little hope for it in the wild. Better to let it live in the zoo.”
Back at the zoo, after the photojournalists are done taking photos, it is the turn of the reporters to point their smartphones at the animal. Then there is a contingent of senior wildlife department officials waiting in line to catch a glimpse of the animal. 
“So much for keeping it away from human contact,” a conservationist observing the hullabaloo from a distance said.

Erroneous border pillar placement plagues Nepali farmers in Madhesh 
","The National Assembly was formed to give experienced people a chance to be part of the parliament and help during the formation of important bills. In countries that follow the Westminster model of government, the upper house plays an important role. That, however, is not the case in Nepal as the country’s upper house has become a platform where individuals secure positions in the National Assembly based on their connections. As the election nears, many once again question the relevance and existence of the upper house.
Things were different in the past as the initial years of the National Assembly saw experienced politicians and experts others in their field be nominated for the post. That slowly changed as the first batch completed its two-year term.
“I understand why people are frustrated with the upper house. People expected experts but all we got was party cadres who lacked knowledge or experience,” says Bimala Rai Paudyal a National Assembly member. “Considering such behaviour and practices, what distinguishes the House of Representatives from the National Assembly?”
A loser’s second chance 
Narayan Kaji Shrestha, who faced defeat in the 2017 general election from Gorkha-2, was elected as a member of the National Assembly on January 23, 2020. Elected from Gandaki Province, Shrestha currently is the Deputy Prime Minister and Home Minister of the country.
Bhagwati Neupane who lost the election from Gandaki province and Bimala Ghimire who lost the election for mayorship in Bhanu Municipality also shared the same trajectory.
Similarly, Mrigendra Kumar Singh Yadav and Jag Prasad Sharma were defeated in the House of Representatives elections, from Saptari-4 and Dang-3 respectively are now members of the National Assembly. Bam Dev Gautam, who lost the elections from Bardiya, secured a place in the upper house through nomination by President Bidya Devi Bhandari.
Even those who did not win as ward member(s) got the opportunity to become members of the National Assembly including Sindh Bahadur Bishwakarma who was appointed on February 7, 2018. He is soon leaving his post on March 3.
Despite the repeated criticisms, the political parties have not paid attention to this concern posed by political leaders and the general public. The latest proof of this is the list of candidates for the National Assembly elections scheduled on January 25. The list contains names like Krishna Prasad Sitaula, defeated in the House of Representatives elections in 2022 from Koshi Province, and Pooja Chaudhary, who lost in the provincial assembly elections 2022 from Rautahat-3 (a).
Speaker Ganesh Prasad Timilsina, who led the National Assembly for the entire six years under the federal system, is also dissatisfied with the individuals who have made it to the upper house. 
“The allegations are something for the parties to ponder upon. The leaders should have prioritised involving intellectuals/neutrals rather than managing its members,” he says.
The 59-member National Assembly elects eight representatives, equally from all seven provinces, with an additional three individuals nominated by the President. The Constitution ensures representation of women, Dalits, minorities or disabled communities, envisioning that experts, experienced individuals, and the most qualified people from various fields will become members of the National Assembly.
Easy way in
File: A National Assembly meeting
There are some reasons why leaders aspire to join the upper house, and even the leadership create opportunities for them. 
In National Assembly elections, voters consist of local-level heads/deputy heads and provincial assembly members. Typically, individuals seeking these positions undergo a vetting process by their respective parties. As a result, aspiring members of parliament can focus less on persuading individual voters and more on gaining party support to secure their candidacy. 
Moreover, being a member of the National Assembly opens avenues to ministerial roles. The constitution prohibits a National Assembly member from becoming the Prime Minister, but not Deputy Prime Minister. Due to such opportunities, leaders are enticed to seek a position in the assembly.
The National Assembly is currently in its fourth election cycle since the promulgation of the Consitution in 2015. Scheduled for January 25, this election aims to fill 19 seats vacated by individuals completing their six-year terms. The previous election cycles took place in 2017, involving 56 members, followed by 2019 with 18 positions, and 2020 with 19 positions.
The cascading impacts
File: A National Assembly meeting
Another reason why the National Assembly is finding it difficult to justify itself is that it has become a shadow of the House of Representatives. The meeting of the National Assembly did not have one session when the House of Representatives was dissolved by then Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli twice. The demands and issues raised by the opposition parties in the House of Representatives automatically went to the National Assembly, where the parliamentarians of the ruling party put forward any proposal, they endorse it the same as in the House of Representatives.
The latest example – is the main opposition UML did not allow the meeting of the House of Representatives to continue for five days from July 5, 2023, due to a statement made by Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal during his visit to India. Consequently, the meeting of the National Assembly was also paused during that period.
The UML obstructed the House of Representatives for almost a month starting mid-July last year demanding a high-level inquiry committee to probe the 60-kilogram gold smuggling case and the resignation of the Home Minister. The National Assembly followed suit with leaders pushing their agendas forward.
Speaker Ganesh Timilsina himself is dissatisfied that every behaviour and activity of the House of Representatives influence the National Assembly. He says despite his attempts to prevent the overshadowing, it has been unfortunate that he did not garner the goodwill of the top leaders during political disputes.
Reinstating power
The National Assembly is a permanent institution. Therefore, it can remain operational even in the absence of the House of Representatives. Under normal circumstances, Speaker Timilsina initiated a positive practice by personally participating in different committees. Nevertheless, in the absence of the House of Representatives, the National Assembly often experienced inactivity.
In December 2020, the Prime Minister at that time, KP Sharma Oli, dissolved the House of Representatives. Subsequently, a session of the National Assembly was convened on January 1, 2021. Despite lasting only seven hours over four days, this session, which took place after the dissolution, failed to address crucial public issues. Even after six months, important matters remained unaddressed within the House.
On May 22, 2021, the UML-led government once again dissolved the House of Representatives. The meeting of the National Assembly and committees was affected once more. However, the dissolutions were declared unconstitutional by the Supreme Court, reinstating the parliament.
The Constitution says that despite the closing of the National Assembly session, thematic committee meetings can still take place. However, both the National Assembly and its committees remained inactive until the restoration of the House of Representatives.
According to Khimlal Devkota, a member of the National Assembly, when the House of Representatives was dissolved twice, it seemed that the National Assembly was also in a state of dissolution.
Bimala Rai Paudyal also believes that the inability to resume the upper house is a mark of weakness. 
“Since the government was not in a position to call, the President needed to be consulted by the chair together with the consultation committee. That was not done either,” she says.
Constitutional and legal distinctions

Except for the Constitution of Nepal (1962) and the Interim Constitution of Nepal (2007), all other constitutions in Nepal provided for a bicameral parliament with the National Assembly or the Upper House and the House of Representatives or the Lower House. The practices before 2015 were under the unitary governance system, but after the adoption of the federal democratic republican governance system, the role of the National Assembly has changed somewhat.
In the preamble of the constitution prepared by the ‘Constituent Assembly, and Administrative Organ Designation Committee’ during the drafting of the constitution, it is mentioned that some different qualifications have been prescribed for being a member of the House of Representatives and the National Assembly, with the intention that qualified people can be represented in the National Assembly.
Chair of the National Assembly Ganesh Prasad Timilsina restates that the members of the upper house should be assessed based on the country’s expectations with clear criteria. 
There is no definite definition of an expert in the constitution. It has been stated symbolically, “…It is expected that the members should have some basic skills to face the challenges and fulfil their responsibilities.”
According to the constitution, the responsibility of the National Assembly is to correctly establish the rights of the local level, state, and union, and to prevent the House of Representatives from trying to enact laws contrary to the spirit of federalism. There is an explanatory comment in the constitution about the propriety of the National Assembly – “This House is expected to fulfil its role to maintain creative and mutual relations between the national government and the provinces.”
In addition, there are some constitutional and legal differences regarding the National Assembly. But the MPs are demanding that it should cease. When a bill originating in the House of Representatives is passed and sent to the National Assembly, and if the latter does not decide within 60 days, it proceeds de facto.
This has placed the National Assembly in a dilemma. The Chairman of the National Assembly, Timilsina, says, “Such an arrangement should also apply to the House of Representatives, or both should be equal.”
Need for course correction 
PM Pushpa Kamal Dahal speaking in the National Assembly meeting.
Some instances have turned these so-called experts into a laughing stock due to their actions. 
On July 5, 2023,  a discussion on the Electronic Commerce (E-Commerce) Bill 2023 was tabled in the National Assembly. However, the parliamentarians misunderstood the main point and instead discussed the matter of electricity. The MPs, who had not read the proposal, suggested that electricity consumption within Nepal should also be increased besides exporting electricity to India and Bangladesh.
During the meeting, Ramesh Rijal, the Minister of Industry, Commerce and Supplies, also mentioned that India would purchase electricity during the Prime Minister’s visit. Unfortunately, the bill was unanimously approved.
Timilsina considers the incident an example, that in his six-year tenure, he does not want to remember. Som Bahadur Thapa, a former secretary at the Parliament Secretariat, termed the incident ‘a joke’ in the Parliament of Nepal. 
“This is strong proof of the kind of MPs we have, who speak without knowing what they are talking about.” 
Timilsina assumed the role of the speaker/chair of the National Assembly after the establishment of the Federal Democratic Republic. He had the opportunity to establish the system and the dignity of the National Assembly. However, instead of setting a positive example, he will soon be retiring after being accused of playing tricks with the Speaker and showing interest in the work of the House of Representatives.
Timilsina has repeatedly commented on the affairs of the House of Representatives. The latest instance was during a seminar on ‘Japan: Past, Present, and Future’ held in the capital on December 2, 2023, he publicly stated that the election results of the House of Representatives did not bode well.
Pointing to the emergence of a new party and the victory of some independent candidates, he said, “In a democracy, you get to choose candidates, irrespective of their party affiliation. However, is the signal positive?”
In August/ September 2022, Timilsina wrote a letter to the Election Commission, urging them to extend the tenure of Speaker and Deputy Speaker. Upon receiving a response stating that the Commission would not determine the tenure of the elected Parliament, Timilsina directed the Parliament Secretariat not to execute decisions made by the Management Committee after September 17, 2022.
This created conflict between the Speaker of the House of Representatives and the Speaker of the National Assembly and in the crux of this dispute between the parties, the country had to bear the consequences of this conflict. Laws could not be enacted promptly, and the place once considered the domain of experts was overshadowed by the party’s interest. 
A study conducted by the Democracy Resource Center Nepal (DRCN) on the legislative functioning of the National Assembly has revealed that the Upper House has passed some bills that go against the spirit of federalism.
The report’s concluding remarks say, “…the bills passed by the House of Representatives have not undergone significant changes or discussions in the National Assembly. The conclusion section of the study states that – “Furthermore, some bills, contradicting the spirit of federalism and addressing the interests of interest groups, have been approved by the National Assembly.”
Overall, in the last six years, parties have introduced individuals who, given their presentation level, have raised questions about the National Assembly’s justification. If there are no changes in the constitution, laws, and policies concerning the upper assembly, these concerns will persist.”"

Regenerative Braking in EVs: Advantages, Disadvantages and Common Misconceptions 
","Representational image Photo by Tanushree Rao on Unsplash
While most of the nation was preparing for the festival of lights, Tihar in early November 2023, something no less exciting was fuelling our sparks from oceans away. A queer art festival was happening for the seventeenth year and we had a chance to attend it as delegates. Our delegation was made possible through the collaboration between the Outburst Arts, an art organisation based in Northern Ireland, UK and the British Council, Nepal.
There is a clear distinction between cities in terms of their flourishing arts scenes, and this became apparent during a visit to Belfast, Northern Ireland, specifically for the Outburst Queer Arts Festival held in the charming city centre. The organisation of such a festival requires months of careful preparation and planning.
The queer art festival started as short events lasting a few days. Now, after 17 years, it has grown into a ten-day festival with panel discussions, theatre performances, and exhibitions. Program guides were available at venues, partner hotels, local libraries, and shops. Many delegates, including us, came from outside Northern Ireland to attend.
During the queer art festival, we had the opportunity to connect with art curators, publishers, artists, and representatives from other British Council departments around the world (Lithuania, France, South Africa, Turkey, Greece, Jordan, England, and Argentina to name a few.) 
Each event that we attended gave us a different insight into what the arts can do and how it can facilitate connections. We gained insights from queer publishers and art curators on the challenges they face in their own countries due to resources and sometimes from bureaucracy in systems. We also got to see the way people can thrive when given a platform to showcase their works, such as an art exhibition in which the artist reimagined intimacy for queer people.
On the other hand, Nepal struggles by and large at times for queer visibility. There are no explicit spaces for SOGIESC (Sexual Orientation, Gender Identity and Expressions and Sex Characteristics) artists to showcase their works nor openly come together as a community, it all exists in pocket spaces. In the same way, something that struck us was the presence of older queer artists at the festival. 
It was not just for one particular event during the queer art festival. We noticed an active participation and involvement of older queer people throughout the festival there. It was fascinating to see queer artists in their 40s and 50s share their transformative and inspiring work. Whereas, back home, the queer folks at the forefront of queer art, advocacy and activism are mostly Gen-Zs and millennials. We have very few queer elders that we can count on our fingers who are diligently working for Nepali queer folks. Even among them, some still hold onto archaic notions and refuse to evolve and embrace changes. So, there’s that.
From dream to reality

Before being selected as delegates, both of us joined online meetings with British Council Nepal and the Outburst representatives facilitated through Kaalo 101 (an art space in Patan), along with interested queer artists from Nepal. We had a total of three meetings where we discussed the possibilities and challenges of doing a queer art festival in Nepal. 
The discourse also entailed us sharing a presentation about the updates of the queer art scene in Nepal in the last five years. The updates included memorable leaps taken in queer arts from music to literature and fashion and more by artists from diverse walks of life. Days after the third meeting, the British Council extended invitations to us to attend the Outburst Queer Arts Festival.
Our delegation is just one example of the transcontinental collaboration because it was something that happened for the first time and involved us. But, Outburst Arts and the British Council have been practising cross-continental collaboration for years. Even in this year’s festival, we witnessed a lot of artists from different continents work together in exhibitions, lectures, panel discussions, magazines and so on. The amalgamation introduced us to brilliant thought-provoking work that defies gender and sociopolitical norms. The power of transcontinental collaboration was beyond beautiful.
Imagining queer arts in Nepal

The queer art scene in Nepal is an emerging one. While a full-fledged festival may not be possible now, something small yet significant is achievable. Time and again, different organisations have been running large art exhibitions/tours for weeks and months. However, in the microcosm that is Nepal, especially Kathmandu, the capital is no stranger to art-oriented programs. What it has been unfamiliar with precisely is queer art. And the unfamiliarity is not something induced by the lack of queer artists and their art. Sadly, it is because of inadequate platforms, space and resources to pursue queer arts.
Despite this, through the years there have been events and literature that have emerged centring on queer identity, but it has not come without its challenges. On collections of stories, “Pride Climbing Higher” and “Songs of Revolution” showcase stories from Nepalis across Nepal. There are not many stories reflecting the Nepali queer experiences otherwise. 
June Pride Parade by Queer Youth Group has gained momentum as well in the past few years since its conception, from a small gathering to now a large parade with performances from community members. The same can be said about Blue Diamond Society’s (BDS) Rainbow Visibility Pride events in August during the festival of Saa-Paru (Gai Jatra) which has been running for well over a decade; in recent years they have included flash mobs and interaction programmes as well in lead up to their parade. Individuals within the community have also organised their queer gatherings with friends, thus coming back to the cosmos of pocket spaces in celebrating queerness.
While artists like us are creative with what we want to put out, we still need organisations like the British Council to foster spaces and connections to enable us to do that. Then and again, artists have come together and collaborated on queer-centric projects. But, we need funding and resources to achieve bigger-scale projects that unite more artists and transcend borders.
Both of us advocate for queer rights and are involved in programs and activities that push the narrative further, extend the visibility of the community and normalise conversations surrounding queerness. Among other things, we are also the founders of Queering The Bond, a networking collective for Nepali queer folks and Shuby is also the founder of Queer Honky-Tonk, a platform to promote queer performances and networking with events such as a drag show or open mic every few months. However, both of us, individually or collaboratively can only do so much. 

The challenges of living in a capitalistic world oftentimes outweigh the passion we have for the queer art scene in Nepal. And this is where we expect the government and organisations to step up with policies, platforms and programs to provide spaces, opportunities and resources for queer artists. Here, the British Council joined hands with Outburst Arts, which paved the way for our delegation. We would not have known about the marvellous queer art festival at the other end of the world otherwise.
Besides the limitations brought by insufficient spaces and social unawareness, the centralised capital does hinder queer artists from outside the city to connect, create and collaborate. Art already is centralised and elitist. On top of that, the concentrated Kathmandu Valley is of no help when it comes to making art accessible beyond its borders.
Furthermore, there is also the expectation from basically everyone to have the perfect festival that caters to all people’s needs and wants. While the festival, if it should happen, is bound to be done with the right intentions, there is a lot of pressure for the first-time event itself. The festival will be inclusive and diverse. But, realistically speaking, it would be a struggle to make it relevant to each queer person from east to west.
Speaking of struggles, a visceral feeling of uneasiness swarmed over me with each step I took while exiting the airport after the flight back home. I, Birat, personally felt that I could not be as free or unrestrained in Nepal as I was during my time in Belfast. No wonder a lot of the queer people we know opt for abroad.
Seventeen years ago, when the Outburst Queer Arts Festival first began, it certainly was not as celebrated or large as it is now. What we are trying to convey here is that we do not have to start big. We can aim for something small yet promising. While there might be expectations to check all the boxes, it is crucial to be mindful of our capacity as well. But, we can be capacitated and this is where you – people in power, art enthusiasts, grant and resource allocators and media come in. It is time we all believe in Nepali queer art and create space for it to not only survive but thrive. It is imperative to understand that formulating our imagination into reality can only be possible through unwavering collaboration."

Nepal’s ‘low-altitude’ snow leopard would face big hurdles in return to wild 
","The month of January saw major road accidents in different parts of the country, including Lamhi in Dang, Dhorpatan in Baglung, and Chandragiri in Kathmandu. Road accidents have been common throughout the country with Nepal Police data suggesting over 2,500 people dying in them annually. Despite this, the Ministry of Finance has shown reluctance to introduce the proposed Road Safety Bill to reduce traffic accidents, fatalities, and serious injuries, and enhance road safety. 
Instead, the Finance Ministry has asked the Ministry of Physical Infrastructure and Transport to include the proposed bill in the Public Roads Act. Along with that, the government’s initiative to pass dedicated laws on road safety and set up a mechanism, including the empowered National Road Safety Council (NRSC), to decrease accidents, has come to a halt.
Keshav Kumar Sharma, secretary of the Ministry of Physical Infrastructure and Transport, says they asked for a dedicated road safety law that comprehensively addresses institutional arrangements was the need of the hour. This includes ensuring safety in road construction, promoting public awareness, providing training and communication facilities, implementing rescue mechanisms, and arranging rehabilitation for families affected by road accidents. However, the Ministry of Finance believes a separate law is unnecessary due to concerns about potential increased financial burden.
Hourly need

Officials from the Ministry of Physical Infrastructure allege that the Ministry of Finance is approaching sensitive matters, such as passenger safety, solely from an economic standpoint. They say that concerns related to road, vehicle, and passenger safety are being overshadowed, and there are indications that this approach will continue. 
“The government is avoiding addressing the sensitive issue of road accidents and the associated human and material costs, fearing an increase in expenses. This contradicts the government’s commitment and policy to reduce traffic accidents in the future,” says an official from the Ministry of Physical Infrastructure on the condition of anonymity.
According to the Ministry of Physical Infrastructure, the existing laws lack the vision and purpose necessary for developing a sustainable, safe, risk-free, and reliable transportation operation and security system. Therefore, the Ministry of Physical Infrastructure officials argue that a distinct law is essential to decrease road accidents and ensure the safety of pedestrians, including passenger transport workers and roadside residents, as well as pets, wild animals, and birds. 
“The Road Safety Act is the need of the hour as it will help us during post-accident rescue, treatment management, rehabilitation, and legal representation,” says the official.
Currently, there are gaps in enforcing road rules, monitoring vehicle capacities, ensuring road structure safety, managing traffic signs, and organizing road safety facilities. The implementation of the Road Safety Act is seen as crucial to address these issues.
However, there has not been a facilitative environment for providing education and raising awareness about road traffic safety, safety mechanisms, and coordinating among organisations related to road transport. The aspect of training drivers with skills and knowledge, as well as monitoring road safety on the roads, is also lacking. This is why experts have been suggesting introducing a separate road safety law to address these aspects.
The Finance Ministry, however, says that road safety should not be downplayed by ignoring human sensibilities related to road safety and citing economic reasons. Officials from the Ministry of Physical Infrastructure argue that incorporating safety considerations in the Road Act does not automatically result in a decrease in accidents or the integration of post-accident rescue, relief, and rehabilitation efforts.
“The existing laws do not address road safety anywhere. Due to its lack of clarity and inadequacy, it has not been implemented with due diligence. For instance, provisions such as those for vehicle inspectors outlined in the Transport Act have not been acted upon by the government,” says an official from the Transport Ministry.
Policies and commitments, but no laws

The Motor Vehicles and Transport Management Act (1993) includes several provisions related to vehicle registration, road permits, driver’s licenses, traffic management, insurance, and penalties. The Public Roads Act (1974) primarily focuses on road management. However, there is no provision in the Act regarding the National Road Safety Council.
In this situation, Nepal has developed a 10-year road safety action plan but is yet to enact corresponding legislation. Unfortunately, government agencies and mechanisms are not obligated to follow the action plan, as it lacks legal guidance.
Now, the Transport Ministry holds the view that if safety considerations are explicitly addressed in the Public Roads Act, the outcome will not differ from what the Finance Ministry has said. Given the Public Roads Act’s close association with the Department of Road, the ministry thinks greater emphasis will be placed on road construction. However, they argue that incorporating the road safety aspect into the Act would not be effective.
Secretary Sharma of the Transport Ministry is tasked with ensuring road safety, overseeing physical infrastructure and transport, and coordinating efforts across education, health, home, law, federal affairs, and general administration ministries. This responsibility extends to provincial ministries, local levels, as well as various agencies, organisations, security agencies, non-governmental organisations, and related entities, each with their specific roles.
“As all the agencies need to be allocated responsibilities for various aspects of road safety, we have requested them to collaborate in formulating a distinct law. This should encompass the reduction of all types of accidents,” said Sharma.
The ministry believes that a dedicated law addressing road safety is crucial to mitigate severe road accidents in Nepal and to uphold the commitments made by the country on the international stage.
Nepal has committed to implementing the Stockholm Declaration through the Global Road Traffic Safety Conference in 2020, as per the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. Nepal, which has incorporated sustainable development goals into its national development plan, has not yet commenced work aligned with these objectives.

Nevertheless, Nepal’s neighbouring countries are already addressing road safety through legal frameworks. Various states in India have enacted road safety laws, and the effectiveness of these laws is contributing to a 50 per cent reduction in road accidents.
In 1999, Bhutan also introduced a unified road safety and transport act. Pakistan, on the other hand, issued the National Highway Safety Ordinance-2000 to ensure road safety, distinct from its National Highway Authority Act (1991). Britain, Australia, America, New Zealand, and other countries have established separate road safety laws as well.
Road safety neglected
In Nepal, road safety has been consistently neglected due to the absence of dedicated legislation. Road safety expert Keshav Adhikari says that the government primarily focused on road construction, overlooks crucial aspects such as road safety and reinforcement. Consequently, roads are transforming into perilous pathways for both vehicles and passengers.
“There is a lack of interest in formulating policies and laws aimed at mitigating financial losses resulting from accidents,” says Adhikari.
He further points out that safety is not a governmental priority, as expanding the road network is perceived to yield more political benefits than implementing additional structures to enhance road safety.
“When I worked as an expert in the Transport Ministry for over a year, I realised that promoting road safety is not a government priority,” he says. “Annually, more people die due to road accidents than those who die in natural disasters, but the government has not given it much attention.”
Even though the prime minister, ministers, and MPs keep asserting that roads have been constructed, no one seems to be addressing the critical issues of road safety and quality.
Saroj Sitaula, General Secretary of the Federation of Nepalese National Transport Entrepreneurs (FNNTE), says that the government must be attentive as accidents are on the rise due to various technical and human factors, including road infrastructure. 
“Many accidents can be mitigated by improving road conditions, installing barriers on the sides, putting up informational boards, and ensuring scientific and practical road markings,” he says. “We need to formulate a plan and progress accordingly.”
Sitaula argues that the government should establish policies to create mechanisms for emergency rescue, treatment, and rehabilitation after an accident occurs. He emphasises the importance of enhancing road infrastructure, conducting a scientific examination of the technical condition of vehicles, and ensuring compliance with the law by drivers, passengers, and regulators. He says that blaming drivers and transport entrepreneurs for accidents is inadequate, and the government must fulfil its responsibilities.
Roads are unsafe

Nepal currently boasts a road network spanning approximately 100,000 km, with the majority consisting of dirt and gravel roads. Among the more than 22,000 kilometres of national and subsidiary highways, numerous sections remain unpaved.
Despite the government’s substantial investment in road construction and expansion, minimal efforts are allocated to ensuring road safety. 
Recently, all three levels of government have accelerated the widening of roads, incorporating asphalt and slopes. However, it appears that issues concerning road quality and safety are escalating at a faster pace. Roads that have been neglected in the guise of maintenance have become a nightmare for the public.
Infrastructure expert Suryaraj Acharya notes that these problems arise due to the tendency to construct roads only after they have sustained damage, without considering potential issues during the initial construction phase."

Realme has launched its popular mid-range number series smartphone, the Realme 12 Pro series. The series includes the Realme 12 Pro 5G and the Realme 12 Pro+ 5G which are the successors of the Realme 11 Pro+ 5G and Realme 11 Pro 5G respectively. The Realme 11 series was widely appreciated for its design and performance at the price range. 
The 12 series has stepped up the game with an even better design. Realme has not only changed the design but has also upgraded the performance and the camera to compete in the mid-range price market. Realme recently has been focusing a lot on the design aspect and the price range performance. 
The 12 Pro+ has some major differences from last year’s 11 Pro+ which include design, IP rating, chipset, camera and charging. 
Let us see what the luxuriously designed smartphone delivers in terms of specs.

Design and Display
The Realme 12 Pro+ and the Realme 12 Pro share the same design and dimensions. The design is fascinating. Realme patterned up with Luxury Swiss Watch designer Ollivier Savéo to craftfully design the smartphone. 
All the colour options have a vegan leather back. Since the phone is designed by a luxury watch designer, it comes with a big round camera module housing the triple camera setup. There is a golden 3D Jubilee Bracelet which gives the texture of a luxury watch strap. A golden patterned line runs through the middle and around the camera module for an even better look.

The unattended issue of road safety in Nepal 
","Ram Bujhaun Yadav with his land ownership certificate stands near a border pillar which he says was erroneously placed on his land. 
In October 2023, when 51-year-old Ram Bujhaun Yadav of Musaharnia Rural Municipality-5, Mukhiyapatti, Dhanusha, was at a relative’s house, someone told him that two Indian Sashastra Seema Bal (SSB) personnel were looking for him.
Anxious, he rushed home wondering why they were looking for him.
“They asked me if the paddy field in the no man’s land was mine. I told them yes and they asked me to cut down the paddy immediately,” he said.
The paddy was not ripe and Yadav asked them for some time. However, the SSB personnel told him he had to cut down his paddy immediately.
Ram Bujhaun and his wife Tetari Devi each own a 677-square-metre plot of land. As Nepal and India reevaluated the border, Ram Bujhan’s land was been deemed to be near the no man’s land as it now has two demarcation pillars.
Frustrated, Ram Bujhaun cut the paddy before it was due to be harvested. Now, he has been asked to not plant anything on the land as it falls in the no man’s land.
“Our border police don’t say a word. I can’t fight the SSB on my own,” says Ram Bujhaun adding he had decided not to plan anything on the land anymore.
Woes of the farmers
Many farmers in southern Nepal say their land has now been placed in India after the recent demarcation. 
When the Jamuna River, which flows through the no man’s land between Nepal and India, changed its course some two decades ago, some border pillars went missing. Locals say these pillars have now been placed encroaching on Nepali land.
In 2018, with the then Chief District Officer of Dhanusha, Pradeep Raj Kandel, and an official from Madhubani district, Bihar, India, a team that included border security forces from both countries, the Armed Police Force of Nepal, and SSB of India began placing border pillars after land measurement by technicians.
Locals have raised concerns, stating that border pillars have been positioned, encroaching approximately 50 to 100 meters of land into Nepal compared to the previous position. Many like Ram Bujhaun are unaware of when these border pillars were placed.
“I did not know that pillar was placed here. After I found out when I asked the village leaders, many said they were placing the border pillars as they pleased,” said Ram Bujhaun.
He was told to carry on planting paddy and that it would not matter as these issues had happened in the past. 
“They encroached on my land and have asked me not to plant anything. This is gross injustice,” he says.
Ram Bujhaun’s family owns a total of 4,000 square metres of land, with 2,000 square metres belonging to him and the remaining 2,000 square metres to his brother Bechan. However, 1,000 square metres of his land is now located on the Indian side after the demarcation. Despite this, he has been farming on the land and continues to pay taxes to the Department of Land Management and Archive in Nepal.
“They have marked my land to be on the Indian side and placed border pillars on it. I’ve been farming till now but I don’t know when they will ask me to stop,” he says.
Ignorance of the government
The Madhesh province in southern Nepal
The former ward chair of Mukhiyapatti Musharniya Rural Municipality-5, Ram Naresh Yadav, said that over time, India has encroached on numerous Nepali lands in various locations in the Madhesh Province. This, he says, happened due to the Nepali administration’s ignorance and weak stature.
“They (Nepali administration) were careless and that meant the Indian side placed these border pillars by encroaching on Nepali land,” says Ram Naresh.
He said that over 40 farmers from wards 1, 5, and 6 have land ranging from 300 to 1,600 square metres on the Indian side. 
“These farmers have land ownership certificates, but they cannot farm as the SSB says the land is in India and not Nepal,” said Ram Naresh.
In 1996, land ownership certificates were distributed after surveying the land in the border area. Local Dharmendra Kumar Yadav said that since then, the locals have been paying their land tax regularly. In 2018, when the pillar was being placed, the locals protested when they saw their land was being encroached on. However, since the demarcation had been agreed upon by high-ranking government officials of Nepal and India, the farmer’s voices went unheard.
“We tried to stop when the border pillars were being placed on our land. But the administrators from both sides forcibly put it there without even trying to hold a discussion,” said Harish Chandra Yadav. 
The Chief District Officer of Dhanusha, Chakrapani Pandey, says that the border pillars were placed by the technical team after the measurements and with the agreement of the high-ranking officials of the two countries.
“The fields and houses that are built in no man’s land have recently been cleared. No one can do anything in this particular area,” said Pandey. “We understand the people’s concern but we cannot do anything about it now.”"

Life is filled with surprises and unexpected events and it can change at any moment. The only thing certain in life is the uncertainty. Change is a natural and inevitable part of our lives, and it may be positive as well as negative.
Even though it is not guaranteed that we will wake up in the morning, we set the alarm every night with the hope that we will wake up in the morning. We do not know what each day is going to bring us, but we may have varieties, adventures, and endless opportunities.
The push to explore
The uncertainty sometimes forces us to explore those aspects of life, we never knew existed or needed. It also tests the mental strength of people and how they deal with it. The uncertainty has taught me to be grateful, as we never know what life throws at us.
In life, everything does not go according to our plans, and if we do not embrace the change we will face huge trouble. The Covid-19 pandemic is the best example of uncertainty, we were constantly fearing death and it was uncertain that we would see the sunrise the next day.
It is not certain that every decision in life will be correct, but if you fear not trying at all, you miss endless opportunities for learning and growing. When our decisions or outcomes are on the negative side, we get depressed and we might tend to think about committing suicide, but we forget that if we have life we have endless opportunities. 
Most of us plan for our careers, our love life, etc. and when those plans do not work out we start getting uncomfortable. But if we can deal with today, we can surely deal with tomorrow. We need to cherish little moments in our lives and know that nothing is permanent not even the failures and setbacks.
We come here with nothing and leave with nothing. So why should we hold the egos and grudges against each other? Instead of making our life meaningful and enjoying the journey of life, we get into puzzles of accumulating wealth and we go against our own loved ones for it. 
Change is certain

Nothing is permanent in life, everything can change in fractions of seconds. In today’s society, everyone is so busy, that we people have so less time for our loved ones. What I have learned over the years, is to find time in our busy schedule for our family because we never know when it will be our last day together with them. 
Yes! Death is a natural process, so if you have to die someday, why should you die with grudges in your heart? But instead of worrying about the inevitable, focusing on the things you can control will bring a lot of happiness in life.
Uncertainty is not only a negative thing; it also brings a lot of opportunity because you dare to change. The life-changing experience will not come knocking down your door, you need to expose yourself. We learn by doing and experimenting, even though we might fail. But that is not the end of the world. I still remember hesitating while applying for the role of leadership, at my school level as it was not certain that I would be chosen.
Even after being selected, I was uncertain about whether I could fulfil my responsibilities or not. But that uncertainty helped me grow out of my comfort zone and give my best input. If I had not applied for that role just because I was uncertain of the outcome, I would miss the biggest learning opportunity in my school life. So, do not let the uncertainty or the unknown ever stop you from trying and no matter how much we try, to plan life always finds a way to surprise us. 
It is important to stay grounded when we have everything we wish for because life can take such a turn that we had never expected in our wildest dreams. Similarly, nothing is permanent in life, the financial hardships, the grades, the breakups, etc. But the most important thing is not to lose hope during those difficult times.
According to the data provided by Nepal police, around 6,830 people took their lives in the fiscal year 2022/23. There is nothing in life that cannot be resolved although it may take time, committing suicide should not be an option. It’s important to share feelings among family members or loved ones because together as a family any problem can be overcome.
Embrace the unknown and focus on enhancing your life, instead of worrying about what will happen next. Always find time for your loved ones, as life is uncertain. We should be grateful that we are alive and accept that change is the only constant thing in life. Do not let the unknown, stop you from trying or achieving your goals and always remember that even if you fail, you still have endless opportunities."

Realme 12 Pro+ 5G: Is it the best designed phone for 2024? 
","Pankaj Bikram Nembang and Kiran Rai.
Kathmandu, November 9
The special general meeting of the All Nepal Football Association (ANFA) is being held on Thursday in Hetauda. 
The primary agenda of the special general meeting is the potential dismissal of ANFA president Pankaj Bikram Nembang. 
An ANFA source told Onlinekhabar that the decision regarding the Nembang’s removal will be finalised today.
In August, a majority of ANFA members submitted a petition, presenting 19 allegations against the current leadership, demanding the dismissal of both ANFA president Pankaj Bikram Nembang and General Secretary Kiran Rai, citing their alleged inability to effectively carry out their duties.
However, Nembang chose to confront the dismissal proposal and brought the matter to the special general meeting. He maintained that, according to the statute, the authority to appoint or dismiss the general secretary lies with the working committee. Nembang included only his agenda in the discussion.
The special general meeting will cast their votes on Nembang’s dismissal today. Out of the total 107 members (including districts, clubs, and associations) of ANFA, only 87 individuals will hold the right to vote in this session.
As per the ANFA constitution, a two-thirds majority vote is necessary for the dismissal of the president. This means at least 58 votes will be required to proceed with the president’s removal."

In 2023, Nepali cricket has experienced a significant surge. Both the senior and U19 teams have successfully qualified for their respective World Cups. The senior team has secured a berth in the T20 World Cup, while the U19 team has earned a spot in the U19 ODI World Cup.
The senior team secured their spot in the T20 World Cup, which is scheduled to take place in the US and the West Indies, by clinching second place in the Asia Qualifier. This marks Nepal’s return to the T20 World Cup after a decade.
Similarly, the U19 team is set to make a comeback to the U19 World Cup after an eight-year hiatus. With a victory over the UAE in the qualifier final, the team led by Dev Khanal is poised to make history once again in January 2024.
Over the years, Nepal’s cricket journey has seen significant milestones. The senior team participated in the ICC T20 World Cup in Bangladesh in 2014, while the U19 team had already made their mark in World Cup events. Since their debut in the U19 World Cup in Sri Lanka in 2000, Nepal consistently qualified for subsequent tournaments until 2008. Although they missed out in 2010 and 2014, they did take part in the 2012 edition. A highlight was Nepal’s U19 team reaching the quarter-finals in 2016.
During their debut in the T20 World Cup, Nepal competed in the first round and faced hosts Bangladesh, Hong Kong and Afghanistan. The team did well as they beat Hong Kong and Afghanistan but lost to Bangladesh who qualified for the second round on a better net run-rate.
The upcoming T20 World Cup will feature a new format, with 20 countries participating for the first time. This expansion allows for more associate countries to be part of the event. The 20 teams will be divided into four groups, each consisting of five teams. This means Nepal will have the opportunity to compete against at least two major cricketing nations, providing them with valuable exposure and experience against higher-ranked teams.
According to former cricketer Sharad Vesawkar, who participated in the 2014 edition, bigger teams will now approach matches against Nepal with greater caution. 
“We played well in the Asia Cup and Asian Games. Winning the qualifier semi-final convincingly showcases our capabilities,” said Vesawkar.
The U19 team will also test themselves against the future stars of cricket. 
It is safe to say that 2024 is poised to be another monumental year for Nepali cricket. It will be a year of celebration for Nepal’s cricket teams. Fans will be glued to their TVs, cheering on both squads as they face off against some of the world’s best teams."

","Nepali players celebrate after qualifying for the 2024 T20 World Cup. 
Despite losing to Oman in the final of the T20 World Cup Asia Qualifier, the Nepal cricket team will take part in the 2024 T20 World Cup that will be held in the US and the West Indies. Nepal confirmed its berth by beating rivals UAE in the semi-final of the qualifiers in a jam-packed Mulpani Cricket Ground on November 3.
The entire nation celebrated the team’s accomplishment. The team were back in the World Cup after a decade. This would not have been possible without the hard work, motivation, and dedication of the team along with the constant mentoring from head coach Monty Desai. However, the most crucial element was the fans, who served as the team’s unwavering support system. They cheered for every victory and responded with encouragement in the face of setbacks.
Back on the big stage

Nepal first took part in the T20 World Cup in 2014 under the leadership of Paras Khadka. Drawn in a tough group against hosts Bangladesh, Afghanistan and Hong Kong in the first round, Nepal’s performance was one for the ages as they narrowly missed out on the second round finishing second on net run rate behind Bangladesh. 
Many believed this campaign would act as a springboard. However, the team struggled in the T20 World Cup Qualifier in Ireland in 2015 finishing ninth and missing out on taking part in the event in India. This was followed by the loss of their T20I status in 2015 after consecutive unsuccessful qualification attempts in 2016.
Road to glory
Gulshan Jha after hitting the winning runs against the UAE during the ICC Men’s Cricket World Cup League 2 in Kathmandu on March 16. 
Post 2014, the growth of cricket in Nepal faced significant challenges, including political interference, internal conflicts within the team management, and a lack of accountability. The sport also grappled with financial and infrastructural crises, which particularly affected the organisation of high-quality domestic tournaments. Consequently, this led to instances of irresponsible and immature gameplay during crucial moments. Nepal also contended with the poor state of grass-root cricket and the subpar quality of practice venues.
What also did not help was the government and affiliated bodies’ neglect, despite the sport’s popularity since its inception and its growth potential. Furthermore, the International Cricket Council (ICC) suspended the sole governing body, the Cricket Association of Nepal (CAN), in 2016 due to political interference. These challenges, combined with ongoing issues, led to a decline in Nepal’s cricketing standards, resulting in repeated failures to qualify for the T20 World Cup.
Growth over the years

Despite that, Nepali cricket continued. The contributions and accomplishments of former Nepali cricketers such as Shakti Gauchan, Sharad Vesawkar, Jitendra Mukhiya, and numerous other unsung heroes were always valued and acknowledged. Their dedication ignited a transformative passion for cricket in Nepal as many in the current team picked up the game following them. Moreover, Nepali cricket continued to progress over time. In 2018, the team earned its ODI status, and the subsequent year saw the successful reinstatement of its previously lost T20 status after Nepal received ICC Membership. 
That gave Nepal an added boost ahead of the inaugural ICC World Cup Cricket League 2. Before Monty Desai’s appointment, Nepal was in danger of losing their ODI status, which would have jeopardised all the progress they had made. Prior to Desai’s arrival, Nepal had faced a tough stretch, losing 14 out of 24 games. However, Desai’s influence brought about a significant transformation, completely turning the group’s dynamics around.
By winning 11 out of their last 12 matches, Nepal not only kept their ODI status but also secured a spot in the 2023 World Cup Qualifier held in Zimbabwe. During the qualifier, while Nepal faced formidable opponents like Zimbabwe, Netherlands, and the West Indies, they displayed commendable resilience, putting up a fight in each match. Additionally, they achieved a victory against the US, demonstrating their competitive spirit.
Nepal also got to take part in the ACC Emerging Cup 2023 talking on Pakistan A and India A. This proved to be a good test for the team which then went on to take on the senior teams in the Asia Cup 2023. Results did not go their way, but the manner in which Nepal competed against the best in the world, showed signs Nepal had what it takes. 
The greatest progress for the players seemed to be in terms of their gameplay, approach, and sensibility towards the game. Given the right opportunity and guidance, Nepali cricket attracted the attention of the entire cricket fraternity and was applauded for their fearlessness.
Additionally, the team had the chance to train with the Rajasthan Royal Academy, allowing players to identify and address their areas of strengths and weaknesses. All these preparations allowed Nepal to perform brilliantly in the qualifiers with an increased sense of competitiveness. 
Positives to take

The T20 World Cup qualifier tournament highlighted several noteworthy individual and team performances from Nepal. Despite close defeats against Oman, the team showcased their skill and earned another chance to compete on the main stage.
Standing in Nepal and the T20 World Cup were familiar foes, UAE. In front of what seemed like tens of thousands at the Mulpani Cricket Ground, Nepal outshone the UAE, securing their spot in the T20 World Cup—a feat they had last accomplished in 2014, exactly a decade ago.
This was a team effort and different players rose to the occasion.
Aashif Sheikh’s composed half-century innings against the UAE in the semi-final, along with Gulshan Jha’s rapid-fire half-century in the thrilling encounter against Oman in the final, allowed Nepal to post a respectable total. This, coupled with a brilliant innings from captain Rohit Paudel, exemplified the maturity and discipline the team had developed over the years. Despite some concerns, particularly in the bowling department, the undeniable rise in the team’s standards, particularly in fielding and batting, stands as a significant achievement from the tournament.
Nepal had a chance to finish the tournament strong, but Oman proved to be too good as they won a nailbiter in the final thanks to Naseem Khushi and Bilal Khan.
As Nepal gears up for the T20 World Cup 2024, addressing bowling concerns while upholding batting and fielding consistency will be paramount. It will be crucial to grasp the nuances of overseas conditions.
Additionally, making judicious use of left-arm orthodox bowler Lalit Rajbanshi, who has proven to be invaluable in the past, in tandem with the inclusion of Sandeep Lamichhane, presents a significant challenge that needs to be navigated effectively ahead of the major tournament."

Cricket team handed pre-announced cash prizes for their performance in 2023
","Kathmandu, November 5
Oman have beaten Nepal in a dramatic final of the T20 World Cup Asia Qualifier which went to a super over.
Winning the toss and batting first, Nepal lost opener Aasif Sheikh early. But Kushal Bhurtel gave Nepal a good foundation scoring a quick-fire 31 before throwing his wicket to Aqib Ilyas. Wicket continued to fall as Sundeep Jora and Kushal Malla also got out cheaply.
With Nepal in the spot of bother, captain Rohit Paudel and Gulshan Jha played a blinder of an inning. Jha hit the Oman bowlers all over the park and hit 54 of just 25 balls while Paudel remained unbeaten on 52. The two put up a 78-run stand to give Nepal a shot at a competitive target as Nepal got to 184 thanks to a late burst from Karan KC who smashed 20 of six balls.
Bilal Khan stood out as the pick of the bowlers, claiming three wickets, while Zeeshan Maqsood also delivered an impressive performance. However, the remaining bowlers struggled to contain the Nepali batters, especially Paudel, Jha, and KC, who took them to task.
In reply, Nepal did not start the game well. Despite picking a wicket, Sompal Kami was poor conceding 37 runs in his first three overs. Kashyap Prajapati took on both Kami and Kushal Malla who had no answer for his clinical batting. Aqib Ilyas was as impressive but threw his wicket away to Jha.
Zeeshan Maqsood tried to take the chase ahead with Prajapati but once he got out to part-timer Bibek Yadav, a flurry of wickets followed. Some tight overs by Yadav and death over specialist Abinash Bohora gave Nepal control of the game. Bohora picked up the crucial wicket of Prajapati to put Nepal in the driving seat. 
But in an interesting turn of events, Mohammad Nadeem turned the game on its head scoring 24 of nine balls to send the match to a super over.
Naseem Khushi then took over hitting three sixes off Abinash Bohora to all but win the game for Oman. Chasing 22 in the super-over, Nepal were restricted to 10 runs losing the final in heart breaking fashion."

Winning the toss, the UAE chose to bat first on a tricky Mulpani pitch. Even though captain Muhammad Wassem got off to a flyer, two quick wickets put the UAE on the back foot. While Vriitya Aravind stood strong at one end, wickets continued to fall as no one could get going on a slowish pitch where spinners dominated the UAE batters.
Kushal Malla was the pick of the bowlers taking three wickets in three overs and was supported well by Sandeep Lamichhane who was superb with the ball taking two wickets giving away only 14 runs in four overs. Aravind, however, kept going to score an impressive 64 as the UAE scored 134 in the allotted 20 overs.
In reply, Nepal started the game positively. Despite losing opener Kushal Bhurtel early, Aasif Sheikh played the anchor role to take control of the match along with Gulshan Jha. Sheikh finished with 65 while the game was finished with a late burst from Rohit Paudel who scored 35 of 21.

This loss by 5 runs means Nepal have finished second in the group and will have to play their semi-final at the Mulpani Cricket Cricket Ground on Friday.
Having asked Oman to bat first, Nepal got off to a strong start, quickly reducing them to 48 for four. The Nepali bowlers continued to take wickets, putting pressure on the Oman batters. However, a burst of performance from Zeeshan Maqsood, Naseem Khushi, and Shakeel Ahmed propelled Oman to a respectable score of 145 in the allotted 20 overs.
Karan KC, despite being expensive, managed to secure three wickets, while Sompal Kami and Sandeep Lamichhane claimed two wickets each. Gulshan Jha and Abinash Bohara contributed with a wicket each.
Nepal’s batting performance did not commence on a positive note. Bilal Khan dismissed Aasif Sheikh early on, leading to a series of wickets. Nepal struggled against Oman’s spinners, preventing them from gaining momentum towards the target.
Mehran Khan was superb with the bowl along with Aqib Ilyas and Shakeel Ahmed. All three picked up two wickets each to bowl Nepal out for 140. The score flatters Nepal who were on the back foot for the entire game but only lost by 5 runs thanks to some late hitting by Bibek Yadav who nearly won Nepal the game in the last over.

Winning the toss and batting first, Singapore got off to a poor start losing their captain and opener Aritra Dutta in the second ball of the innings.

T20 World Cup Asia Qualifier: Nepal reach semi-final in style by beating Malaysia by 6 wickets
","Karan KC dominated the Hong Kong batters at the Mulpani International Cricket Ground on October 19, 2023.
The stage was set at the TU Cricket Ground as Nepal took on their rivals the UAE in the final of the T20I Triangular Series. Coming in unbeaten in the series and at home over the past year, Nepal were the favourites. 
The UAE, however, was determined to shake off their recent losses to Nepal. Having been defeated multiple times in the past year, they were eager to outperform their rivals. That is exactly what happened, as Nepal fell to the UAE by four wickets in a tightly contested match.
The T20I Triangular Series, featuring Nepal, Hong Kong and the UAE, acted like a warm-up tournament for the T20 World Cup Asia Qualifiers. These qualifiers will determine the associate team from Asia that will compete in the 2024 T20 World Cup in the USA and the West Indies.
Despite Nepal losing in the final, the team did get some exposure as they had not played T20I cricket against competitive teams for nearly two years. Nepal were good in the four group games against both Hong Kong and the UAE but the loss in the final might have raised some alarms as the team will have to win at least one knockout game to qualify for the 2024 T20 World Cup.
A look back
The T20I rivalry between Hong Kong and Nepal traces its roots back to 2012, with Nepal emerging as the dominant side, winning the majority of the matches. On the other hand, the rivalry between the UAE and Nepal has been longstanding, dating back to 2019. Before this series, the UAE had historically held the edge over Nepal in T20I encounters.
Nepal, however, have had a mental edge against the UAE as they have time and again beaten them over the past year along with the two games in the T20I Triangular Series.
The tournament highlighted Nepal’s much-anticipated dominance, with the hosts displaying exceptional form and advancing to the T20I Triangular Series finals undefeated. It was clear that Nepal were experimenting and testing their bench strength in the series prior to the 2024 T20 World Cup Asia Qualifier that starts on October 30 in Nepal.
Not all rosy
UAE lift the T20I Triangular Series trophy at the TU Cricket Ground on October 27. 
Despite reaching the final and narrowly losing to the UAE, Nepal’s performance underscores the need for improvement, as the T20I Triangular Series highlighted several pressing issues.
The inconsistency of opener Kushal Bhurtel and his struggle to convert promising starts were major concerns for Nepal. There was a strong sentiment in favour of establishing a stable batting lineup with minimal experimentation. While young Kushal Malla demonstrated aggressive gameplay, he struggled to put together a composed innings, except for a blazing 92 off 41 deliveries against Hong Kong. There was also a recognised need to explore options in pace bowling to lessen the team’s reliance on Karan KC and Sompal Kami.
The middle order of the team needs to step up if Nepal wishes to qualify and compete against the top teams in the US and the West Indies next year. Sandeep Lamichhane was absent from the tournament, taking some personal time off. His absence was notable as Nepal lacked a wicket-taking bowler in the middle part of the innings. His form, which has not been at its best, will be a crucial factor for Nepal’s success in the upcoming series.
Not all bad
Rohit Paudel and Dipendra Singh Airee gave Nepal a comfortable victor over the UAE in the T20I Triangular Series at Mulpani International Cricket Ground on October 18, 2023. 
The tournament provided numerous positive takeaways for Nepal. With the qualifiers on the horizon, the outstanding form of all-rounder Dipendra Singh Airee was a standout. His performance in batting and fielding throughout the tournament significantly boosted the team’s overall confidence.
Lalit Rajbhanshi, the left-arm orthodox spinner, made a remarkable comeback, contributing to the improvement in the spin department. Nepal elevated its fielding standards with high-calibre catches and impressive efforts, showcasing a commendable display of skill and commitment.
Another notable highlight from the tournament was the performance of Nepal’s death bowling specialist, Abinash Bohora. His consistent and impactful deliveries at crucial moments, coupled with his skilful variations, showcased him as a promising asset in the pace lineup.
What next?
Tournaments and series like these play a vital role before regional qualifiers, as they bolster players’ confidence, refine their skills and abilities, and enable them to pinpoint and work on their areas of strength and weakness.
As expected, the tournament underscored challenges that require attention, strategies that need refinement, and squad stabilisation issues that demand immediate action. Moreover, many young players gained invaluable experience in the most daunting and demanding format of the game.
The T20I Triangular Series served as a valuable opportunity for teams to acclimate to the playing conditions. This effort was spearheaded by the Cricket Association of Nepal and Nepal’s head coach, Monty Desai, who organised the event in collaboration with the pitch curators, ensuring the venues were well-maintained and of high quality.
For emerging associate nations, arranging regular practice matches and tours can be a challenge. Thus, competitions like these play a crucial role in aiding players’ development. Additionally, excelling in this format can lead to international recognition, potentially opening doors to participate in major T20 tournaments such as the Indian Premier League (IPL), Big Bash League (BBL), and others. Consequently, players at the associate level stand to gain from these tournaments, including opportunities to attract sponsors, showcase their talents, and elevate their cricketing standards.
The T20I Triangular Series served as a valuable warm-up for Nepal. The team now has a clear understanding of what it takes to progress to the next level. To succeed, they will need to continue playing the high-quality cricket they have demonstrated since Desai took over as head coach. However, the question remains: can they maintain that level of play under the pressure of the home crowd? Only time will tell."

Even though Kushal Bhurtel did make the most of it and scored a half-century, the rest of the team struggled to get going. Teenager Ayan Afzal Khan proved too good for the Nepali batters on the day as he did not let them get away picking up Aasif Sheikh and Kushal Malla.
Bhurtel soon followed them back to the dressing room as Nepal were reduced to 68 for three. Just as a partnership was brewing between Rohit Paudel and Dipendra Singh Airee however, both of them threw their wickets away as Nepal had to rely on a late burst from Karan KC to get to 162 from their allotted 20 overs.
In reply, the UAE batters started the game in attacking fashion with Muhammed Waseem making the most of the lives the Nepali fielders gave him scoring a quick-fire 45 and putting up a 71-run stand with opener Aryansh Sharma. Nepal did rally by taking some wickets making the game interesting but it was too late as UAE beat Nepal for only the second time in 2023.

In 2023, Barbie named Women in Sports as their career of the year.
Whenever I am out and about socially, there is always someone who seems pretty certain about not considering my profession as mainstream. Hold up! Sports as a career? In Nepal? You bet! This article aims to explain why women in this male-dominant sports industry in Nepal should not be viewed as a surprise.
I have been part of the Nepali cricket industry in a private capacity for quite a while now. Armed with a Master’s Degree in IT from an American University, my choice to stick with sports management tends to raise eyebrows. While I am not an on-field player, I am definitely behind the scenes, playing strong games of serious deliverance with my team. We are all about creating what is not there.
As untouched and less discussed as the sports management industry is in Nepal, it has ample room to showcase creativity. Being a commanding woman in a position can be challenging, but on the brighter side, the gender advantage has yet to fail me. As alien as I might be in sports management in Nepal, I have been accepted with open arms. The nature of the job is highly competitive, no doubt.

Women in sports are safe, heard, and welcomed. I absolutely relish the addition of spirited women to the team. The nuances of sports are something women complement greatly. Sports management inherently rejects narrow minds. There is a lot of travelling, meeting people, experimenting, and remembering limitations. The adjustments are both trivial and clever. 
Often, in our part of the world, societal norms limit women from making career decisions, hindering them from living life on their terms. This restriction potentially keeps many capable women from pursuing the sports industry, where they could truly wield their power to make an impact. Change is gradual, and I hope to see numerous female faces in charge of stadiums someday in Nepal.
Yes, there are challenges. It ranges from personal sacrifices to job security and opportunities. However, these are workable factors for any freelancer in sports management. The key is excelling at our jobs to thrive anywhere. 
Taking a page from the medical field, the seriousness we apply there should not differ in sports management. Sports is a powerful industry. Children grow up idolising what we showcase on TV. As glorious as the game is, it is every child’s dream to represent their country someday. Carrying that responsibility is our role in sports—an often thankless yet deeply satisfying job.
Nepali sports industry
The fans went wild at TU Cricket Ground after Nepal beat UAE.
Sports may be a smaller industry in Nepal, but globally, it is a behemoth. The world economy has shifted, and it is time we alter our perspective to recognise the potential of sports as an industry in Nepal. The idea of open commercialisation of sports remains somewhat unexplored, as it continues to be a more exclusive affair in Nepal. 
By sourcing innovative ideas, there’s a wealth of public attention and investment waiting to be tapped into, along with numerous practices to establish and discard. As the Nepali team achieves international records, the packaging of the sport becomes everything. There is plenty to learn from international sports management to make our industry highly marketable and poised for global entry.
Sports such as cricket, football, volleyball, or even golf serve as key intersections for reshaping Nepal’s global narrative. Over the years, Kabaddi has witnessed a substantial surge in India, both in terms of viewership and commercial success. The primary challenge we grapple with is Nepal’s comparatively small market size, posing constraints on our ability to generate substantial economic gains. Therefore, there is unanimous agreement on the imperative for Nepal’s sports to venture onto the international stage.
Nepal boasts many hardworking individuals, yet achieving this goal demands specialised talents in sports management with the requisite experience and the capacity to enhance existing values. In the long run, outsourcing such talents may foster dependence. Hence, a concerted effort is needed to inspire Nepali youth to engage in sports management, contributing to our sports ecosystem. 
There are various ways in which we can harness the potential of sports for our benefit. Encouraging youth involvement can be instrumental in capitalising on the multifaceted opportunities presented by the sports industry. There is a lot to explore if you think about it."

ACC Men’s U19 Premier Cup: Nepal cruise into the semi-final with a win against Saudi Arabia
","Painting ‘My Private Life’ by artist Priyam Pradhan at the exhibition Mani at Siddhartha Art Gallery, Baber Mahal. Photo: Chandra Bahadur Ale
Using Pitt’s artist pen on paper, artist Priyam Pradhan presents My Private Life, a showcase of the current significance of his life depicted in abstract form.
At the centre of the painting is a 1000-rupee note, within which Pradhan has intricately painted Lord Krishna, a man wearing a hoodie tenderly embracing his dog, and a woman. The woman stands tall, elongated in form. Towards the bottom of the canvas, a holy man reaches out his hands, appearing to be in flight.
Priyam Pradhan has used a vibrant colour palette, incorporating bright hues such as pink, orange, and yellow, as well as green, black, white, and grey. This combination adds a dynamic and lively quality to the artwork.
“The man in the centre is me and the girl in green is my girlfriend. And the faces are my mom and dad,” says Pradhan. “The sadhu (holy man) symbolises my desires that I don’t have many desires for materialistic things however I do understand the value of money.”
The use of colours, figures and lines in an abstract form in his painting resembles the painting of American painter Paul Jackson Pollock. Like his abstract expressionism, Pradhan has expressed himself in his painting.
Furthermore, this marks Priyam Pradhan’s third solo painting exhibition titled Mani (money), inaugurated on January 17 at Siddhartha Art Gallery, Baber Mahal.
In his previous exhibitions, Pradhan’s artworks centred around Hindu philosophy and his spontaneous thought process. However, in this latest exhibition, he explores the theme of money and its impact on an individual’s life, delving into the reverberating effects of financial aspects.
Understanding the value of money

Any form of art is known as a reflection of the contemporary time. Likewise, Priyam Pradhan’s paintings reflect the lifestyle, desires, obligations and more of today’s younger generation living in urban areas in Nepal.
Pradhan himself is in his 20s and he has justified the want of most of the youngsters in their 20s, who might be declared adults and understand the need for money and materialistic things but are still kids at their heart who want to explore and experience life as much as possible.
The exhibition has 27 paintings which Pradhan took around nine months to complete. According to him, while he was travelling the idea that his life was luxurious and him being capable of exploring anything he wanted to was because of money.
And being an artist this concept lingered on him and he was compelled to create on the theme of money.
Once you enter the gallery, you can also view an animated video, which introduces artist Pradhan and the importance of money, which is on the ground floor. On the first floor, a huge painting (193×62 in cm) Apatkalin Awastha using mixed media on canvas welcomes you and other paintings are small in size (18×30 in cm).
“It is a team work and it is my introduction as an artist for the exhibition,” he says. “Also, being a recent multimedia graduate from Islington College, I wanted to explore my skills and I got my team. Then, like money, multimedia is relevant to current society.”
Experiencing life through art

Priyam Pradhan says enjoyment is the meaning of life and he enjoys creating artwork. Moreover, Pradhan who came into the art world first being a tattoo artist feels blessed that he has the privilege to explore whatever he likes in his life.
He also believes that the philosophy that says one should not be materialistic is wrong. “If material things are not important, why would one build a house? And after building a house why do they want to decorate their house?” he questions.
Alongside, money and materialistic things, his paintings also explore love, romance, life and childhood experiences. Motifs like Pokemon, ramen noodles, animals, dancers, etc have been used in his paintings. In most of his paintings, he has used numerous white lines in wavy form and these lines for Pradhan indicate the sound or the energy that exists in the surroundings all the time.
About using a pitta artist pen, he says, “I have enjoyed drawing and painting since my childhood and using a pitta artist pen helps me revisit that feeling of happiness and sense of freedom.”
So many things happening on the canvas with the use of vibrant colours gives a sense of excitement to the viewers. Though referencing artists like Pollock, MF Husain, Picasso and more, his pen strokes give a sense of newness through his expression and thoughts about his life experiences.
In his paintings, these bright colours and motifs are in harmony and are visual treats that can surely cheer up the mood of any visitor. Moreover, you can also get free stickers from the artist.
If you too are in a gloomy mood and want to uplift a little, visit the exhibition that continues till February 6."

T20I Triangular Series: Nepal register comfortable victory over UAE
","Entrepreneurship education is not just an investment in the education system; it is an investment in the nation’s future prosperity. Photo: Pexels/ Rodnae Productions
In the shadow of the towering Himalayas, Nepal faces a challenge that rivals the steepness of its mountainous terrain- the challenge of economic development. As the nation earnestly pursues its Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), it becomes increasingly evident that a transformation in the education system is not only necessary but also urgent. 
Rooted in common living strategies, the prevailing education model, especially in higher education, may not adequately prepare the youth for the demands of the modern world. 
In this critical juncture, the incorporation of entrepreneurship education emerges as a beacon of hope, offering a pathway towards a self-reliant and prosperous Nepal.
Time to reevaluate the education system
Nepal’s journey towards economic prosperity has been marked by challenges that demand innovative solutions. The commitment of the SDGs reflects not only a global responsibility but also a domestic imperative for sustainable development. For this, it is high time to reevaluate the education system in the country.
The current education system in Nepal, deeply entrenched in common living strategies, has been the foundation of learning for generations. However, in the face of a rapidly evolving world, today’s generation aspires for more than the status quo. The call for independence reverberates through the aspirations of youth who seek a curriculum fostering critical thinking, innovation and entrepreneurial skills.
Entrepreneurship education is a dynamic force capable of reshaping Nepal’s educational landscape. This innovative approach moves beyond traditional learning methods, providing students with the tools to navigate the complexities of the modern world. At its core, entrepreneurship education is about empowering students to implement learned information in practical and tangible ways.
Consider a student engrossed in the intricacies of sensor systems during a science class, entrepreneurship education transforms this theoretical knowledge into practical applications, inspiring the creation of a sensor-operated door. Such innovation born from a fusion of science and entrepreneurship becomes a valuable mindset in solving practical problems.  
Expanding the horizons of entrepreneurship education, let us delve into chemistry. Imagine students studying chemistry not just as a theoretical subject, but also as entrepreneurs in the making. Armed with entrepreneurial principles, these students can tap into Nepal’s rich biodiversity, exploring market demands for products derived from local plants.
In the scenario, chemistry students could embark on a journey to develop performance-enhancing products based on market demand, harnessing the potential of indigenous flora. What makes this approach remarkable is that it does not necessarily require sophisticated machines or extensive human resources. Instead, it leverages the inherent skills and awareness of individuals within the community, paving the way for a grassroots economic revolution.
Entrepreneurship in education

The beauty of entrepreneurship education lies in its universal applicability. It is not confined to science or chemistry alone. Consider an art student, for example. Through entrepreneurship education, they can understand what art to develop (product), how much to set the price (price), where to sell (place) and how to sell (promote) their artworks. Every subject becomes a canvas for innovation and enterprise.
Moreover, entrepreneurship education is a powerful equaliser, recognising the unique skills and talents of individuals across various disciplines. It is not about fitting into a predefined mould but rather about unleashing the potential within each student. When every single person is aware of their skills and potential, they can rise to different levels, contributing to the overall progress of the nation.
Entrepreneurship education goes beyond skill recognition; it is about nurturing the ability to produce goods and mastering the art of marketing. Returning to the example of the student developing a sensor-operated door, entrepreneurship education not only equips them to produce the product but also teaches them how to navigate the complexities of marketing it to potential users and clients.
The impact of entrepreneurship education extends beyond individual success stories; it reverberates through the entire nation. A generation equipped with entrepreneurial skills becomes a driving force for economic growth and independence. They will be able to recognise the resources and ideas to utilise them to reach the global market. They will be able to be the pioneers in products and contribute to the economy. By fostering a culture of innovation, creativity and self-reliance, Nepal can reduce its dependence on external sources and strengthen its economy from within.
In essence, entrepreneurship education is not just an investment in the education system; it is an investment in the nation’s future prosperity. It is a transformative force that has the potential to shape a generation of independent thinkers, innovators and entrepreneurs- the architects of a self-reliant and economically vibrant Nepal. Entrepreneurship education, by teaching students to utilise available resources (physical and financial) and make them commercial, becomes a cornerstone in the nation’s journey towards economic empowerment and independence."

","Ram Bujhaun Yadav with his land ownership certificate stands near a border pillar which he says was erroneously placed on his land. 
In October 2023, when 51-year-old Ram Bujhaun Yadav of Musaharnia Rural Municipality-5, Mukhiyapatti, Dhanusha, was at a relative’s house, someone told him that two Indian Sashastra Seema Bal (SSB) personnel were looking for him.
Anxious, he rushed home wondering why they were looking for him.
“They asked me if the paddy field in the no man’s land was mine. I told them yes and they asked me to cut down the paddy immediately,” he said.
The paddy was not ripe and Yadav asked them for some time. However, the SSB personnel told him he had to cut down his paddy immediately.
Ram Bujhaun and his wife Tetari Devi each own a 677-square-metre plot of land. As Nepal and India reevaluated the border, Ram Bujhan’s land was been deemed to be near the no man’s land as it now has two demarcation pillars.
Frustrated, Ram Bujhaun cut the paddy before it was due to be harvested. Now, he has been asked to not plant anything on the land as it falls in the no man’s land.
“Our border police don’t say a word. I can’t fight the SSB on my own,” says Ram Bujhaun adding he had decided not to plan anything on the land anymore.
Woes of the farmers
Many farmers in southern Nepal say their land has now been placed in India after the recent demarcation. 
When the Jamuna River, which flows through the no man’s land between Nepal and India, changed its course some two decades ago, some border pillars went missing. Locals say these pillars have now been placed encroaching on Nepali land.
In 2018, with the then Chief District Officer of Dhanusha, Pradeep Raj Kandel, and an official from Madhubani district, Bihar, India, a team that included border security forces from both countries, the Armed Police Force of Nepal, and SSB of India began placing border pillars after land measurement by technicians.
Locals have raised concerns, stating that border pillars have been positioned, encroaching approximately 50 to 100 meters of land into Nepal compared to the previous position. Many like Ram Bujhaun are unaware of when these border pillars were placed.
“I did not know that pillar was placed here. After I found out when I asked the village leaders, many said they were placing the border pillars as they pleased,” said Ram Bujhaun.
He was told to carry on planting paddy and that it would not matter as these issues had happened in the past. 
“They encroached on my land and have asked me not to plant anything. This is gross injustice,” he says.
Ram Bujhaun’s family owns a total of 4,000 square metres of land, with 2,000 square metres belonging to him and the remaining 2,000 square metres to his brother Bechan. However, 1,000 square metres of his land is now located on the Indian side after the demarcation. Despite this, he has been farming on the land and continues to pay taxes to the Department of Land Management and Archive in Nepal.
“They have marked my land to be on the Indian side and placed border pillars on it. I’ve been farming till now but I don’t know when they will ask me to stop,” he says.
Ignorance of the government
The Madhesh province in southern Nepal
The former ward chair of Mukhiyapatti Musharniya Rural Municipality-5, Ram Naresh Yadav, said that over time, India has encroached on numerous Nepali lands in various locations in the Madhesh Province. This, he says, happened due to the Nepali administration’s ignorance and weak stature.
“They (Nepali administration) were careless and that meant the Indian side placed these border pillars by encroaching on Nepali land,” says Ram Naresh.
He said that over 40 farmers from wards 1, 5, and 6 have land ranging from 300 to 1,600 square metres on the Indian side. 
“These farmers have land ownership certificates, but they cannot farm as the SSB says the land is in India and not Nepal,” said Ram Naresh.
In 1996, land ownership certificates were distributed after surveying the land in the border area. Local Dharmendra Kumar Yadav said that since then, the locals have been paying their land tax regularly. In 2018, when the pillar was being placed, the locals protested when they saw their land was being encroached on. However, since the demarcation had been agreed upon by high-ranking government officials of Nepal and India, the farmer’s voices went unheard.
“We tried to stop when the border pillars were being placed on our land. But the administrators from both sides forcibly put it there without even trying to hold a discussion,” said Harish Chandra Yadav. 
The Chief District Officer of Dhanusha, Chakrapani Pandey, says that the border pillars were placed by the technical team after the measurements and with the agreement of the high-ranking officials of the two countries.
“The fields and houses that are built in no man’s land have recently been cleared. No one can do anything in this particular area,” said Pandey. “We understand the people’s concern but we cannot do anything about it now.”"

Priyam Pradhan explores the essence of money and life in ‘Mani’ 
","Regenerative braking representational image. Photo: Freepik
The electric vehicle market in Nepal has grown significantly over the past year. 
Electric four-wheelers and two-wheelers are being launched almost every month, spanning from passenger to commercial vehicles. Electric transportation appears to be an emerging trend in the automotive industry.
New EVs are regularly introduced with advanced features as car companies develop unique electric platforms. One standout feature is regenerative braking.
Regenerative braking was first introduced in 1967 by the American Motor Car Company (AMC) in their prototype electric vehicle, the AMC Amitron. However, Toyota became the automobile manufacturer to implement regenerative braking system (RBS) technology in their Prius series hybrid vehicles in 1997. Toyota brought up the new hybrid technology in the Prius when fuel prices were going up at a massive rate.

But what is regenerative braking? There are still many people confused about what it is, whether it is safe or helpful in fuel economy in hybrid cars and the regeneration of electricity in electric cars.
In simple terms, regen braking is when a car saves energy by recharging its battery when you brake, helping it use less fuel or electricity and go further. Easy but scientifically, regen braking is a process used in vehicles where the kinetic energy produced during braking is converted into electrical energy through an electric motor acting as a generator. This electrical energy is then stored in the vehicle’s battery for later use, reducing energy wastage and increasing overall efficiency.

Regen braking can be seen in all kinds of EVs, including cars, scooters, commercial vans, buses, bicycles, three-wheelers, and rickshaws. It now can be electrically managed to what extent the power and braking can be generated. 
Regenerative Braking work process in EV

Principle of Operation: Regene braking works by turning the energy from slowing down into electricity.
Electric Motor as a Generator: In EV or hybrid cars with regen braking, the motor changes roles from moving the car to making electricity when you brake.
Switching Polarity: When you brake, the motor switches directions, turning energy from the wheels into electricity instead of using it to move the car.
Generation of Electricity: The turning wheels make the motor produce electricity, which goes to the car’s battery.
Power Electronics: Special electronics change the electricity from the motor into the right kind for charging the battery.
Battery Charging: The electricity made during braking charges up the car’s battery, storing the energy for later.
Integration with Hydraulic Braking System: Regenerative braking works with the regular brakes, blending them for smooth stopping.

Advantages and Disadvantages of Regenerative Braking 
The advantages are listed below:

Energy Efficiency: Regenerative braking efficiently captures the kinetic energy generated during braking, effectively reducing energy wastage and contributing to a more sustainable driving experience.
Extended Range: By using the energy that would otherwise be lost during braking as heat and sound, regenerative braking helps to extend the driving range of electric vehicles in instances such as travelling downhill. 
Reduced Brake Wear: Regenerative braking minimizes the strain on traditional braking components, mitigating wear and tear, and potentially extending the lifespan of the braking components such as brake pads, rotors and brake lines, thus reducing maintenance costs over time.
Enhanced Driving Experience: Regenerative braking provides a smoother braking experience and a more responsive feel to drivers, enhancing overall driving comfort and control on the road.

The disadvantages are listed below:

Limited Effectiveness at Low Speeds: While regenerative braking efficiently recaptures energy during braking, its effectiveness diminishes at lower speeds which leads to decreased energy recovery compared to higher speeds.
Complexity and Cost: Implementing regenerative braking adds complexity and cost to vehicle systems, potentially raising manufacturing and maintenance expenses, and impacting consumer affordability.
Maintenance Requirements: Regenerative braking systems require periodic maintenance and calibration to ensure they operate optimally.
Efficiency Variability: Regenerative braking may exhibit variability in efficiency under extreme weather conditions or on certain road surfaces, leading to fluctuations in overall energy recapture and impacting the vehicle’s efficiency.

Misconceptions

Fully Recharges Battery: Some mistakenly believe that regenerative braking fully replenishes the battery, but in reality, it only adds a modest amount of charge.
Increases Braking Distances: There is a misconception that regenerative braking extends braking distances, but it enhances braking performance by complementing traditional brakes.
High-Speed Only: While more effective at higher speeds, regenerative braking still functions at lower speeds, such as during city driving or stop-and-go traffic.
Maintenance-Free: Despite requiring less maintenance than traditional brakes, regen braking systems still need periodic checks and maintenance to ensure proper operation.
Significantly Boosts Range: While regen braking contributes to extending the driving range of electric vehicles, its impact is influenced by various factors beyond just braking efficiency.
Only for Electric Cars: Although commonly associated with electric vehicles, regen braking systems are also found in some conventional vehicles, particularly those aiming to improve fuel efficiency with advanced technology.

Regenerative braking might sound complicated, but it is pretty cool. Think of it as a way for EVs and hybrids to recycle energy when they slow down. Instead of just wasting that energy, regenerative braking turns it into electricity, which can then be used to power the battery."

Role of entrepreneurship education in Nepal’s quest for economic empowerment 
","The snow leopard rescued from Urlabari is currently being kept at the Central Zoo in Lalitpur. Photo: Aryan Dhimal
As the gates to the vet clinic at the Central Zoo in Lalitpur opened, more than two dozen photojournalists thronged the facility and surrounded a metal cage aiming their DSLR cameras at a snow leopard inside.
“Please don’t come close to the animal,” the zoo’s vet, Radha Krishna Gharti, told approaching photojournalists. But in the gush of excitement to take exclusive photographs of the elusive cat, difficult to spot even in its prime habitats, there were few takers for the word of caution.
Nepal’s Department of National Parks and Wildlife Conservation (DNPWC) organised the photo-op two days after the male subadult cat, which was until recently found in the country only at altitudes higher than 2,000-6,000 metres above sea level, was brought to the zoo from Urlabari town(146 m above sea level). According to the department, the animal has sustained injuries to its right foreleg and cannot stand upright.
Although officials involved said they are looking at releasing the animal into the wild after it recuperates, doing so will be a daunting task, adding that the zoo may be the only place where it can now survive.
Not a wild cat

“Nepali snow leopard experts have come up with two hypotheses to explain how the animal from the mountains landed up in the plains,” said Sharad Chandra Adhikari, member-secretary at the National Trust for Nature Conservation (NTNC), a semi-government body that manages the zoo in Lalitpur, a town in the Kathmandu Valley. 
The first of the two hypotheses made public during the photo-op-cum-press conference, is that it was raised in captivity and somehow managed to escape into the wild. The second is that it lost its orientation while trying to establish its territory after separating from its mother.
Kulbhushansingh Suryawanshi, director of the India program, Snow Leopard Trust, said that both hypotheses are plausible explanations as to how the snow leopard got to the plains in Nepal.
A DNPWC official, who wished to remain anonymous as he is not authorised to talk to the press, said that it was more likely that the animal had been raised in captivity. 
“The way it sipped the water and ate the food zoo staff offered indicates that it may have been raised in captivity,” the official said.
Snow leopards are shy cats living at extreme altitudes in the steep mountainous areas of 12 countries in Central and South Asia. Their global population spread over altitudes of 500-5,800 m, is estimated to be between around 3,900 and 6,000 as detailed coordinated surveys of the population in the range countries are yet to be carried out. In Nepal, their population divided into three blocks (eastern, central and western) is estimated to be between 301 and 400.
Adhikari from NTNC said that researchers will now examine the animal’s scat to analyse its diet and try to find out whether it was roaming in the wild or had been in some sort of captivity. Researchers are also preparing to analyse its genes to try to find out to which of the three metapopulations in Nepal it belongs. They will also observe the animal’s canine teeth and fur to look for clues.
Relocation challenge

The whole process could take a few months to complete, and summer could set in in Kathmandu by then, officials concede. 
“The current temperature in Kathmandu is suitable for snow leopards, as we are in the peak of winter,” said Madhu Chetri, a snow leopard researcher from NTNC. But that could change as spring season begins in the Northern Hemisphere.
The DNPWC official said that regardless of the findings related to how the animal got to Urlabarli, the animal would have spent a significant amount of time with humans during its recovery phase. “That would mean that it would have gotten habituated with having humans around,” the official said.
Sending such animals back into the wild is a challenge, as they may have lost their hunting and other adaptation skills, he added. In May last year, officials at the Chitwan National Park released two rescued rhino calves into the wild, with limited success. The safety of the animals, which had gotten used to having humans around, was compromised as poachers could easily approach and kill them. Eventually, they were transferred to an enclosure in eastern Nepal away from human intervention.
Veteran conservationist Professor Karan Bahadur Shah said that rewilding the snow leopard would be a daunting task, as the animals are territorial. “If we just leave the animal in its natural habitat, it will get killed by other snow leopards defending their territory,” he said. “The best option would be to keep the animal in the zoo for the public to see.”
But Nepal’s Central Zoo has its own set of problems. The facility, established in 1932 as a private collection, has limited space and has frequently run into financial trouble. Conservationists say the snow leopard would need special facilities to cater to its needs.
“If the government decides that the snow leopard needs to remain at the zoo, we are ready to shoulder the responsibility,” said Adhikari. “We have set up special facilities for animals such as the red panda and chimpanzees,” he said. “We can do that for the snow leopard as well.”
Those advocating for keeping the animal in the zoo also said that Nepal is a snow leopard range country and the public, especially the young generation, also needs to see the different animals found in the country. “It has great educational value,” said Shah.
Snow leopard expert Suryawanshi from neighbouring India also said that it would be challenging to release the animal into the wild. 
“If the team at the zoo can establish the exact cause of this behaviour [why it ventured into the plains] and can keep the animal away from human contact, then it might be okay to release it back,” he said. “But otherwise, there is little hope for it in the wild. Better to let it live in the zoo.”
Back at the zoo, after the photojournalists are done taking photos, it is the turn of the reporters to point their smartphones at the animal. Then there is a contingent of senior wildlife department officials waiting in line to catch a glimpse of the animal. 
“So much for keeping it away from human contact,” a conservationist observing the hullabaloo from a distance said.

National Assembly election taking place today 
","The National Assembly was formed to give experienced people a chance to be part of the parliament and help during the formation of important bills. In countries that follow the Westminster model of government, the upper house plays an important role. That, however, is not the case in Nepal as the country’s upper house has become a platform where individuals secure positions in the National Assembly based on their connections. As the election nears, many once again question the relevance and existence of the upper house.
Things were different in the past as the initial years of the National Assembly saw experienced politicians and experts others in their field be nominated for the post. That slowly changed as the first batch completed its two-year term.
“I understand why people are frustrated with the upper house. People expected experts but all we got was party cadres who lacked knowledge or experience,” says Bimala Rai Paudyal a National Assembly member. “Considering such behaviour and practices, what distinguishes the House of Representatives from the National Assembly?”
A loser’s second chance 
Narayan Kaji Shrestha, who faced defeat in the 2017 general election from Gorkha-2, was elected as a member of the National Assembly on January 23, 2020. Elected from Gandaki Province, Shrestha currently is the Deputy Prime Minister and Home Minister of the country.
Bhagwati Neupane who lost the election from Gandaki province and Bimala Ghimire who lost the election for mayorship in Bhanu Municipality also shared the same trajectory.
Similarly, Mrigendra Kumar Singh Yadav and Jag Prasad Sharma were defeated in the House of Representatives elections, from Saptari-4 and Dang-3 respectively are now members of the National Assembly. Bam Dev Gautam, who lost the elections from Bardiya, secured a place in the upper house through nomination by President Bidya Devi Bhandari.
Even those who did not win as ward member(s) got the opportunity to become members of the National Assembly including Sindh Bahadur Bishwakarma who was appointed on February 7, 2018. He is soon leaving his post on March 3.
Despite the repeated criticisms, the political parties have not paid attention to this concern posed by political leaders and the general public. The latest proof of this is the list of candidates for the National Assembly elections scheduled on January 25. The list contains names like Krishna Prasad Sitaula, defeated in the House of Representatives elections in 2022 from Koshi Province, and Pooja Chaudhary, who lost in the provincial assembly elections 2022 from Rautahat-3 (a).
Speaker Ganesh Prasad Timilsina, who led the National Assembly for the entire six years under the federal system, is also dissatisfied with the individuals who have made it to the upper house. 
“The allegations are something for the parties to ponder upon. The leaders should have prioritised involving intellectuals/neutrals rather than managing its members,” he says.
The 59-member National Assembly elects eight representatives, equally from all seven provinces, with an additional three individuals nominated by the President. The Constitution ensures representation of women, Dalits, minorities or disabled communities, envisioning that experts, experienced individuals, and the most qualified people from various fields will become members of the National Assembly.
Easy way in
File: A National Assembly meeting
There are some reasons why leaders aspire to join the upper house, and even the leadership create opportunities for them. 
In National Assembly elections, voters consist of local-level heads/deputy heads and provincial assembly members. Typically, individuals seeking these positions undergo a vetting process by their respective parties. As a result, aspiring members of parliament can focus less on persuading individual voters and more on gaining party support to secure their candidacy. 
Moreover, being a member of the National Assembly opens avenues to ministerial roles. The constitution prohibits a National Assembly member from becoming the Prime Minister, but not Deputy Prime Minister. Due to such opportunities, leaders are enticed to seek a position in the assembly.
The National Assembly is currently in its fourth election cycle since the promulgation of the Consitution in 2015. Scheduled for January 25, this election aims to fill 19 seats vacated by individuals completing their six-year terms. The previous election cycles took place in 2017, involving 56 members, followed by 2019 with 18 positions, and 2020 with 19 positions.
The cascading impacts
File: A National Assembly meeting
Another reason why the National Assembly is finding it difficult to justify itself is that it has become a shadow of the House of Representatives. The meeting of the National Assembly did not have one session when the House of Representatives was dissolved by then Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli twice. The demands and issues raised by the opposition parties in the House of Representatives automatically went to the National Assembly, where the parliamentarians of the ruling party put forward any proposal, they endorse it the same as in the House of Representatives.
The latest example – is the main opposition UML did not allow the meeting of the House of Representatives to continue for five days from July 5, 2023, due to a statement made by Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal during his visit to India. Consequently, the meeting of the National Assembly was also paused during that period.
The UML obstructed the House of Representatives for almost a month starting mid-July last year demanding a high-level inquiry committee to probe the 60-kilogram gold smuggling case and the resignation of the Home Minister. The National Assembly followed suit with leaders pushing their agendas forward.
Speaker Ganesh Timilsina himself is dissatisfied that every behaviour and activity of the House of Representatives influence the National Assembly. He says despite his attempts to prevent the overshadowing, it has been unfortunate that he did not garner the goodwill of the top leaders during political disputes.
Reinstating power
The National Assembly is a permanent institution. Therefore, it can remain operational even in the absence of the House of Representatives. Under normal circumstances, Speaker Timilsina initiated a positive practice by personally participating in different committees. Nevertheless, in the absence of the House of Representatives, the National Assembly often experienced inactivity.
In December 2020, the Prime Minister at that time, KP Sharma Oli, dissolved the House of Representatives. Subsequently, a session of the National Assembly was convened on January 1, 2021. Despite lasting only seven hours over four days, this session, which took place after the dissolution, failed to address crucial public issues. Even after six months, important matters remained unaddressed within the House.
On May 22, 2021, the UML-led government once again dissolved the House of Representatives. The meeting of the National Assembly and committees was affected once more. However, the dissolutions were declared unconstitutional by the Supreme Court, reinstating the parliament.
The Constitution says that despite the closing of the National Assembly session, thematic committee meetings can still take place. However, both the National Assembly and its committees remained inactive until the restoration of the House of Representatives.
According to Khimlal Devkota, a member of the National Assembly, when the House of Representatives was dissolved twice, it seemed that the National Assembly was also in a state of dissolution.
Bimala Rai Paudyal also believes that the inability to resume the upper house is a mark of weakness. 
“Since the government was not in a position to call, the President needed to be consulted by the chair together with the consultation committee. That was not done either,” she says.
Constitutional and legal distinctions

Except for the Constitution of Nepal (1962) and the Interim Constitution of Nepal (2007), all other constitutions in Nepal provided for a bicameral parliament with the National Assembly or the Upper House and the House of Representatives or the Lower House. The practices before 2015 were under the unitary governance system, but after the adoption of the federal democratic republican governance system, the role of the National Assembly has changed somewhat.
In the preamble of the constitution prepared by the ‘Constituent Assembly, and Administrative Organ Designation Committee’ during the drafting of the constitution, it is mentioned that some different qualifications have been prescribed for being a member of the House of Representatives and the National Assembly, with the intention that qualified people can be represented in the National Assembly.
Chair of the National Assembly Ganesh Prasad Timilsina restates that the members of the upper house should be assessed based on the country’s expectations with clear criteria. 
There is no definite definition of an expert in the constitution. It has been stated symbolically, “…It is expected that the members should have some basic skills to face the challenges and fulfil their responsibilities.”
According to the constitution, the responsibility of the National Assembly is to correctly establish the rights of the local level, state, and union, and to prevent the House of Representatives from trying to enact laws contrary to the spirit of federalism. There is an explanatory comment in the constitution about the propriety of the National Assembly – “This House is expected to fulfil its role to maintain creative and mutual relations between the national government and the provinces.”
In addition, there are some constitutional and legal differences regarding the National Assembly. But the MPs are demanding that it should cease. When a bill originating in the House of Representatives is passed and sent to the National Assembly, and if the latter does not decide within 60 days, it proceeds de facto.
This has placed the National Assembly in a dilemma. The Chairman of the National Assembly, Timilsina, says, “Such an arrangement should also apply to the House of Representatives, or both should be equal.”
Need for course correction 
PM Pushpa Kamal Dahal speaking in the National Assembly meeting.
Some instances have turned these so-called experts into a laughing stock due to their actions. 
On July 5, 2023,  a discussion on the Electronic Commerce (E-Commerce) Bill 2023 was tabled in the National Assembly. However, the parliamentarians misunderstood the main point and instead discussed the matter of electricity. The MPs, who had not read the proposal, suggested that electricity consumption within Nepal should also be increased besides exporting electricity to India and Bangladesh.
During the meeting, Ramesh Rijal, the Minister of Industry, Commerce and Supplies, also mentioned that India would purchase electricity during the Prime Minister’s visit. Unfortunately, the bill was unanimously approved.
Timilsina considers the incident an example, that in his six-year tenure, he does not want to remember. Som Bahadur Thapa, a former secretary at the Parliament Secretariat, termed the incident ‘a joke’ in the Parliament of Nepal. 
“This is strong proof of the kind of MPs we have, who speak without knowing what they are talking about.” 
Timilsina assumed the role of the speaker/chair of the National Assembly after the establishment of the Federal Democratic Republic. He had the opportunity to establish the system and the dignity of the National Assembly. However, instead of setting a positive example, he will soon be retiring after being accused of playing tricks with the Speaker and showing interest in the work of the House of Representatives.
Timilsina has repeatedly commented on the affairs of the House of Representatives. The latest instance was during a seminar on ‘Japan: Past, Present, and Future’ held in the capital on December 2, 2023, he publicly stated that the election results of the House of Representatives did not bode well.
Pointing to the emergence of a new party and the victory of some independent candidates, he said, “In a democracy, you get to choose candidates, irrespective of their party affiliation. However, is the signal positive?”
In August/ September 2022, Timilsina wrote a letter to the Election Commission, urging them to extend the tenure of Speaker and Deputy Speaker. Upon receiving a response stating that the Commission would not determine the tenure of the elected Parliament, Timilsina directed the Parliament Secretariat not to execute decisions made by the Management Committee after September 17, 2022.
This created conflict between the Speaker of the House of Representatives and the Speaker of the National Assembly and in the crux of this dispute between the parties, the country had to bear the consequences of this conflict. Laws could not be enacted promptly, and the place once considered the domain of experts was overshadowed by the party’s interest. 
A study conducted by the Democracy Resource Center Nepal (DRCN) on the legislative functioning of the National Assembly has revealed that the Upper House has passed some bills that go against the spirit of federalism.
The report’s concluding remarks say, “…the bills passed by the House of Representatives have not undergone significant changes or discussions in the National Assembly. The conclusion section of the study states that – “Furthermore, some bills, contradicting the spirit of federalism and addressing the interests of interest groups, have been approved by the National Assembly.”
Overall, in the last six years, parties have introduced individuals who, given their presentation level, have raised questions about the National Assembly’s justification. If there are no changes in the constitution, laws, and policies concerning the upper assembly, these concerns will persist.”"

While most of the nation was preparing for the festival of lights, Tihar in early November 2023, something no less exciting was fuelling our sparks from oceans away. A queer art festival was happening for the seventeenth year and we had a chance to attend it as delegates. Our delegation was made possible through the collaboration between the Outburst Arts, an art organisation based in Northern Ireland, UK and the British Council, Nepal.
There is a clear distinction between cities in terms of their flourishing arts scenes, and this became apparent during a visit to Belfast, Northern Ireland, specifically for the Outburst Queer Arts Festival held in the charming city centre. The organisation of such a festival requires months of careful preparation and planning.
The queer art festival started as short events lasting a few days. Now, after 17 years, it has grown into a ten-day festival with panel discussions, theatre performances, and exhibitions. Program guides were available at venues, partner hotels, local libraries, and shops. Many delegates, including us, came from outside Northern Ireland to attend.
During the queer art festival, we had the opportunity to connect with art curators, publishers, artists, and representatives from other British Council departments around the world (Lithuania, France, South Africa, Turkey, Greece, Jordan, England, and Argentina to name a few.) 
Each event that we attended gave us a different insight into what the arts can do and how it can facilitate connections. We gained insights from queer publishers and art curators on the challenges they face in their own countries due to resources and sometimes from bureaucracy in systems. We also got to see the way people can thrive when given a platform to showcase their works, such as an art exhibition in which the artist reimagined intimacy for queer people.
On the other hand, Nepal struggles by and large at times for queer visibility. There are no explicit spaces for SOGIESC (Sexual Orientation, Gender Identity and Expressions and Sex Characteristics) artists to showcase their works nor openly come together as a community, it all exists in pocket spaces. In the same way, something that struck us was the presence of older queer artists at the festival. 
It was not just for one particular event during the queer art festival. We noticed an active participation and involvement of older queer people throughout the festival there. It was fascinating to see queer artists in their 40s and 50s share their transformative and inspiring work. Whereas, back home, the queer folks at the forefront of queer art, advocacy and activism are mostly Gen-Zs and millennials. We have very few queer elders that we can count on our fingers who are diligently working for Nepali queer folks. Even among them, some still hold onto archaic notions and refuse to evolve and embrace changes. So, there’s that.
From dream to reality

Before being selected as delegates, both of us joined online meetings with British Council Nepal and the Outburst representatives facilitated through Kaalo 101 (an art space in Patan), along with interested queer artists from Nepal. We had a total of three meetings where we discussed the possibilities and challenges of doing a queer art festival in Nepal. 
The discourse also entailed us sharing a presentation about the updates of the queer art scene in Nepal in the last five years. The updates included memorable leaps taken in queer arts from music to literature and fashion and more by artists from diverse walks of life. Days after the third meeting, the British Council extended invitations to us to attend the Outburst Queer Arts Festival.
Our delegation is just one example of the transcontinental collaboration because it was something that happened for the first time and involved us. But, Outburst Arts and the British Council have been practising cross-continental collaboration for years. Even in this year’s festival, we witnessed a lot of artists from different continents work together in exhibitions, lectures, panel discussions, magazines and so on. The amalgamation introduced us to brilliant thought-provoking work that defies gender and sociopolitical norms. The power of transcontinental collaboration was beyond beautiful.
Imagining queer arts in Nepal

The queer art scene in Nepal is an emerging one. While a full-fledged festival may not be possible now, something small yet significant is achievable. Time and again, different organisations have been running large art exhibitions/tours for weeks and months. However, in the microcosm that is Nepal, especially Kathmandu, the capital is no stranger to art-oriented programs. What it has been unfamiliar with precisely is queer art. And the unfamiliarity is not something induced by the lack of queer artists and their art. Sadly, it is because of inadequate platforms, space and resources to pursue queer arts.
Despite this, through the years there have been events and literature that have emerged centring on queer identity, but it has not come without its challenges. On collections of stories, “Pride Climbing Higher” and “Songs of Revolution” showcase stories from Nepalis across Nepal. There are not many stories reflecting the Nepali queer experiences otherwise. 
June Pride Parade by Queer Youth Group has gained momentum as well in the past few years since its conception, from a small gathering to now a large parade with performances from community members. The same can be said about Blue Diamond Society’s (BDS) Rainbow Visibility Pride events in August during the festival of Saa-Paru (Gai Jatra) which has been running for well over a decade; in recent years they have included flash mobs and interaction programmes as well in lead up to their parade. Individuals within the community have also organised their queer gatherings with friends, thus coming back to the cosmos of pocket spaces in celebrating queerness.
While artists like us are creative with what we want to put out, we still need organisations like the British Council to foster spaces and connections to enable us to do that. Then and again, artists have come together and collaborated on queer-centric projects. But, we need funding and resources to achieve bigger-scale projects that unite more artists and transcend borders.
Both of us advocate for queer rights and are involved in programs and activities that push the narrative further, extend the visibility of the community and normalise conversations surrounding queerness. Among other things, we are also the founders of Queering The Bond, a networking collective for Nepali queer folks and Shuby is also the founder of Queer Honky-Tonk, a platform to promote queer performances and networking with events such as a drag show or open mic every few months. However, both of us, individually or collaboratively can only do so much. 

The challenges of living in a capitalistic world oftentimes outweigh the passion we have for the queer art scene in Nepal. And this is where we expect the government and organisations to step up with policies, platforms and programs to provide spaces, opportunities and resources for queer artists. Here, the British Council joined hands with Outburst Arts, which paved the way for our delegation. We would not have known about the marvellous queer art festival at the other end of the world otherwise.
Besides the limitations brought by insufficient spaces and social unawareness, the centralised capital does hinder queer artists from outside the city to connect, create and collaborate. Art already is centralised and elitist. On top of that, the concentrated Kathmandu Valley is of no help when it comes to making art accessible beyond its borders.
Furthermore, there is also the expectation from basically everyone to have the perfect festival that caters to all people’s needs and wants. While the festival, if it should happen, is bound to be done with the right intentions, there is a lot of pressure for the first-time event itself. The festival will be inclusive and diverse. But, realistically speaking, it would be a struggle to make it relevant to each queer person from east to west.
Speaking of struggles, a visceral feeling of uneasiness swarmed over me with each step I took while exiting the airport after the flight back home. I, Birat, personally felt that I could not be as free or unrestrained in Nepal as I was during my time in Belfast. No wonder a lot of the queer people we know opt for abroad.
Seventeen years ago, when the Outburst Queer Arts Festival first began, it certainly was not as celebrated or large as it is now. What we are trying to convey here is that we do not have to start big. We can aim for something small yet promising. While there might be expectations to check all the boxes, it is crucial to be mindful of our capacity as well. But, we can be capacitated and this is where you – people in power, art enthusiasts, grant and resource allocators and media come in. It is time we all believe in Nepali queer art and create space for it to not only survive but thrive. It is imperative to understand that formulating our imagination into reality can only be possible through unwavering collaboration."

Erroneous border pillar placement plagues Nepali farmers in Madhesh 
","The month of January saw major road accidents in different parts of the country, including Lamhi in Dang, Dhorpatan in Baglung, and Chandragiri in Kathmandu. Road accidents have been common throughout the country with Nepal Police data suggesting over 2,500 people dying in them annually. Despite this, the Ministry of Finance has shown reluctance to introduce the proposed Road Safety Bill to reduce traffic accidents, fatalities, and serious injuries, and enhance road safety. 
Instead, the Finance Ministry has asked the Ministry of Physical Infrastructure and Transport to include the proposed bill in the Public Roads Act. Along with that, the government’s initiative to pass dedicated laws on road safety and set up a mechanism, including the empowered National Road Safety Council (NRSC), to decrease accidents, has come to a halt.
Keshav Kumar Sharma, secretary of the Ministry of Physical Infrastructure and Transport, says they asked for a dedicated road safety law that comprehensively addresses institutional arrangements was the need of the hour. This includes ensuring safety in road construction, promoting public awareness, providing training and communication facilities, implementing rescue mechanisms, and arranging rehabilitation for families affected by road accidents. However, the Ministry of Finance believes a separate law is unnecessary due to concerns about potential increased financial burden.
Hourly need

Officials from the Ministry of Physical Infrastructure allege that the Ministry of Finance is approaching sensitive matters, such as passenger safety, solely from an economic standpoint. They say that concerns related to road, vehicle, and passenger safety are being overshadowed, and there are indications that this approach will continue. 
“The government is avoiding addressing the sensitive issue of road accidents and the associated human and material costs, fearing an increase in expenses. This contradicts the government’s commitment and policy to reduce traffic accidents in the future,” says an official from the Ministry of Physical Infrastructure on the condition of anonymity.
According to the Ministry of Physical Infrastructure, the existing laws lack the vision and purpose necessary for developing a sustainable, safe, risk-free, and reliable transportation operation and security system. Therefore, the Ministry of Physical Infrastructure officials argue that a distinct law is essential to decrease road accidents and ensure the safety of pedestrians, including passenger transport workers and roadside residents, as well as pets, wild animals, and birds. 
“The Road Safety Act is the need of the hour as it will help us during post-accident rescue, treatment management, rehabilitation, and legal representation,” says the official.
Currently, there are gaps in enforcing road rules, monitoring vehicle capacities, ensuring road structure safety, managing traffic signs, and organizing road safety facilities. The implementation of the Road Safety Act is seen as crucial to address these issues.
However, there has not been a facilitative environment for providing education and raising awareness about road traffic safety, safety mechanisms, and coordinating among organisations related to road transport. The aspect of training drivers with skills and knowledge, as well as monitoring road safety on the roads, is also lacking. This is why experts have been suggesting introducing a separate road safety law to address these aspects.
The Finance Ministry, however, says that road safety should not be downplayed by ignoring human sensibilities related to road safety and citing economic reasons. Officials from the Ministry of Physical Infrastructure argue that incorporating safety considerations in the Road Act does not automatically result in a decrease in accidents or the integration of post-accident rescue, relief, and rehabilitation efforts.
“The existing laws do not address road safety anywhere. Due to its lack of clarity and inadequacy, it has not been implemented with due diligence. For instance, provisions such as those for vehicle inspectors outlined in the Transport Act have not been acted upon by the government,” says an official from the Transport Ministry.
Policies and commitments, but no laws

The Motor Vehicles and Transport Management Act (1993) includes several provisions related to vehicle registration, road permits, driver’s licenses, traffic management, insurance, and penalties. The Public Roads Act (1974) primarily focuses on road management. However, there is no provision in the Act regarding the National Road Safety Council.
In this situation, Nepal has developed a 10-year road safety action plan but is yet to enact corresponding legislation. Unfortunately, government agencies and mechanisms are not obligated to follow the action plan, as it lacks legal guidance.
Now, the Transport Ministry holds the view that if safety considerations are explicitly addressed in the Public Roads Act, the outcome will not differ from what the Finance Ministry has said. Given the Public Roads Act’s close association with the Department of Road, the ministry thinks greater emphasis will be placed on road construction. However, they argue that incorporating the road safety aspect into the Act would not be effective.
Secretary Sharma of the Transport Ministry is tasked with ensuring road safety, overseeing physical infrastructure and transport, and coordinating efforts across education, health, home, law, federal affairs, and general administration ministries. This responsibility extends to provincial ministries, local levels, as well as various agencies, organisations, security agencies, non-governmental organisations, and related entities, each with their specific roles.
“As all the agencies need to be allocated responsibilities for various aspects of road safety, we have requested them to collaborate in formulating a distinct law. This should encompass the reduction of all types of accidents,” said Sharma.
The ministry believes that a dedicated law addressing road safety is crucial to mitigate severe road accidents in Nepal and to uphold the commitments made by the country on the international stage.
Nepal has committed to implementing the Stockholm Declaration through the Global Road Traffic Safety Conference in 2020, as per the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. Nepal, which has incorporated sustainable development goals into its national development plan, has not yet commenced work aligned with these objectives.

Nevertheless, Nepal’s neighbouring countries are already addressing road safety through legal frameworks. Various states in India have enacted road safety laws, and the effectiveness of these laws is contributing to a 50 per cent reduction in road accidents.
In 1999, Bhutan also introduced a unified road safety and transport act. Pakistan, on the other hand, issued the National Highway Safety Ordinance-2000 to ensure road safety, distinct from its National Highway Authority Act (1991). Britain, Australia, America, New Zealand, and other countries have established separate road safety laws as well.
Road safety neglected
In Nepal, road safety has been consistently neglected due to the absence of dedicated legislation. Road safety expert Keshav Adhikari says that the government primarily focused on road construction, overlooks crucial aspects such as road safety and reinforcement. Consequently, roads are transforming into perilous pathways for both vehicles and passengers.
“There is a lack of interest in formulating policies and laws aimed at mitigating financial losses resulting from accidents,” says Adhikari.
He further points out that safety is not a governmental priority, as expanding the road network is perceived to yield more political benefits than implementing additional structures to enhance road safety.
“When I worked as an expert in the Transport Ministry for over a year, I realised that promoting road safety is not a government priority,” he says. “Annually, more people die due to road accidents than those who die in natural disasters, but the government has not given it much attention.”
Even though the prime minister, ministers, and MPs keep asserting that roads have been constructed, no one seems to be addressing the critical issues of road safety and quality.
Saroj Sitaula, General Secretary of the Federation of Nepalese National Transport Entrepreneurs (FNNTE), says that the government must be attentive as accidents are on the rise due to various technical and human factors, including road infrastructure. 
“Many accidents can be mitigated by improving road conditions, installing barriers on the sides, putting up informational boards, and ensuring scientific and practical road markings,” he says. “We need to formulate a plan and progress accordingly.”
Sitaula argues that the government should establish policies to create mechanisms for emergency rescue, treatment, and rehabilitation after an accident occurs. He emphasises the importance of enhancing road infrastructure, conducting a scientific examination of the technical condition of vehicles, and ensuring compliance with the law by drivers, passengers, and regulators. He says that blaming drivers and transport entrepreneurs for accidents is inadequate, and the government must fulfil its responsibilities.
Roads are unsafe

Nepal currently boasts a road network spanning approximately 100,000 km, with the majority consisting of dirt and gravel roads. Among the more than 22,000 kilometres of national and subsidiary highways, numerous sections remain unpaved.
Despite the government’s substantial investment in road construction and expansion, minimal efforts are allocated to ensuring road safety. 
Recently, all three levels of government have accelerated the widening of roads, incorporating asphalt and slopes. However, it appears that issues concerning road quality and safety are escalating at a faster pace. Roads that have been neglected in the guise of maintenance have become a nightmare for the public.
Infrastructure expert Suryaraj Acharya notes that these problems arise due to the tendency to construct roads only after they have sustained damage, without considering potential issues during the initial construction phase."

6 years on, the National Assembly has struggled to show its worth 
","Ram Bujhaun Yadav with his land ownership certificate stands near a border pillar which he says was erroneously placed on his land. 
In October 2023, when 51-year-old Ram Bujhaun Yadav of Musaharnia Rural Municipality-5, Mukhiyapatti, Dhanusha, was at a relative’s house, someone told him that two Indian Sashastra Seema Bal (SSB) personnel were looking for him.
Anxious, he rushed home wondering why they were looking for him.
“They asked me if the paddy field in the no man’s land was mine. I told them yes and they asked me to cut down the paddy immediately,” he said.
The paddy was not ripe and Yadav asked them for some time. However, the SSB personnel told him he had to cut down his paddy immediately.
Ram Bujhaun and his wife Tetari Devi each own a 677-square-metre plot of land. As Nepal and India reevaluated the border, Ram Bujhan’s land was been deemed to be near the no man’s land as it now has two demarcation pillars.
Frustrated, Ram Bujhaun cut the paddy before it was due to be harvested. Now, he has been asked to not plant anything on the land as it falls in the no man’s land.
“Our border police don’t say a word. I can’t fight the SSB on my own,” says Ram Bujhaun adding he had decided not to plan anything on the land anymore.
Woes of the farmers
Many farmers in southern Nepal say their land has now been placed in India after the recent demarcation. 
When the Jamuna River, which flows through the no man’s land between Nepal and India, changed its course some two decades ago, some border pillars went missing. Locals say these pillars have now been placed encroaching on Nepali land.
In 2018, with the then Chief District Officer of Dhanusha, Pradeep Raj Kandel, and an official from Madhubani district, Bihar, India, a team that included border security forces from both countries, the Armed Police Force of Nepal, and SSB of India began placing border pillars after land measurement by technicians.
Locals have raised concerns, stating that border pillars have been positioned, encroaching approximately 50 to 100 meters of land into Nepal compared to the previous position. Many like Ram Bujhaun are unaware of when these border pillars were placed.
“I did not know that pillar was placed here. After I found out when I asked the village leaders, many said they were placing the border pillars as they pleased,” said Ram Bujhaun.
He was told to carry on planting paddy and that it would not matter as these issues had happened in the past. 
“They encroached on my land and have asked me not to plant anything. This is gross injustice,” he says.
Ram Bujhaun’s family owns a total of 4,000 square metres of land, with 2,000 square metres belonging to him and the remaining 2,000 square metres to his brother Bechan. However, 1,000 square metres of his land is now located on the Indian side after the demarcation. Despite this, he has been farming on the land and continues to pay taxes to the Department of Land Management and Archive in Nepal.
“They have marked my land to be on the Indian side and placed border pillars on it. I’ve been farming till now but I don’t know when they will ask me to stop,” he says.
Ignorance of the government
The Madhesh province in southern Nepal
The former ward chair of Mukhiyapatti Musharniya Rural Municipality-5, Ram Naresh Yadav, said that over time, India has encroached on numerous Nepali lands in various locations in the Madhesh Province. This, he says, happened due to the Nepali administration’s ignorance and weak stature.
“They (Nepali administration) were careless and that meant the Indian side placed these border pillars by encroaching on Nepali land,” says Ram Naresh.
He said that over 40 farmers from wards 1, 5, and 6 have land ranging from 300 to 1,600 square metres on the Indian side. 
“These farmers have land ownership certificates, but they cannot farm as the SSB says the land is in India and not Nepal,” said Ram Naresh.
In 1996, land ownership certificates were distributed after surveying the land in the border area. Local Dharmendra Kumar Yadav said that since then, the locals have been paying their land tax regularly. In 2018, when the pillar was being placed, the locals protested when they saw their land was being encroached on. However, since the demarcation had been agreed upon by high-ranking government officials of Nepal and India, the farmer’s voices went unheard.
“We tried to stop when the border pillars were being placed on our land. But the administrators from both sides forcibly put it there without even trying to hold a discussion,” said Harish Chandra Yadav. 
The Chief District Officer of Dhanusha, Chakrapani Pandey, says that the border pillars were placed by the technical team after the measurements and with the agreement of the high-ranking officials of the two countries.
“The fields and houses that are built in no man’s land have recently been cleared. No one can do anything in this particular area,” said Pandey. “We understand the people’s concern but we cannot do anything about it now.”"

Queer art festival: Reflecting and imagining the power of collaboration in Nepal

Life is filled with surprises and unexpected events and it can change at any moment. The only thing certain in life is the uncertainty. Change is a natural and inevitable part of our lives, and it may be positive as well as negative.
Even though it is not guaranteed that we will wake up in the morning, we set the alarm every night with the hope that we will wake up in the morning. We do not know what each day is going to bring us, but we may have varieties, adventures, and endless opportunities.
The push to explore
The uncertainty sometimes forces us to explore those aspects of life, we never knew existed or needed. It also tests the mental strength of people and how they deal with it. The uncertainty has taught me to be grateful, as we never know what life throws at us.
In life, everything does not go according to our plans, and if we do not embrace the change we will face huge trouble. The Covid-19 pandemic is the best example of uncertainty, we were constantly fearing death and it was uncertain that we would see the sunrise the next day.
It is not certain that every decision in life will be correct, but if you fear not trying at all, you miss endless opportunities for learning and growing. When our decisions or outcomes are on the negative side, we get depressed and we might tend to think about committing suicide, but we forget that if we have life we have endless opportunities. 
Most of us plan for our careers, our love life, etc. and when those plans do not work out we start getting uncomfortable. But if we can deal with today, we can surely deal with tomorrow. We need to cherish little moments in our lives and know that nothing is permanent not even the failures and setbacks.
We come here with nothing and leave with nothing. So why should we hold the egos and grudges against each other? Instead of making our life meaningful and enjoying the journey of life, we get into puzzles of accumulating wealth and we go against our own loved ones for it. 
Change is certain

Nothing is permanent in life, everything can change in fractions of seconds. In today’s society, everyone is so busy, that we people have so less time for our loved ones. What I have learned over the years, is to find time in our busy schedule for our family because we never know when it will be our last day together with them. 
Yes! Death is a natural process, so if you have to die someday, why should you die with grudges in your heart? But instead of worrying about the inevitable, focusing on the things you can control will bring a lot of happiness in life.
Uncertainty is not only a negative thing; it also brings a lot of opportunity because you dare to change. The life-changing experience will not come knocking down your door, you need to expose yourself. We learn by doing and experimenting, even though we might fail. But that is not the end of the world. I still remember hesitating while applying for the role of leadership, at my school level as it was not certain that I would be chosen.
Even after being selected, I was uncertain about whether I could fulfil my responsibilities or not. But that uncertainty helped me grow out of my comfort zone and give my best input. If I had not applied for that role just because I was uncertain of the outcome, I would miss the biggest learning opportunity in my school life. So, do not let the uncertainty or the unknown ever stop you from trying and no matter how much we try, to plan life always finds a way to surprise us. 
It is important to stay grounded when we have everything we wish for because life can take such a turn that we had never expected in our wildest dreams. Similarly, nothing is permanent in life, the financial hardships, the grades, the breakups, etc. But the most important thing is not to lose hope during those difficult times.
According to the data provided by Nepal police, around 6,830 people took their lives in the fiscal year 2022/23. There is nothing in life that cannot be resolved although it may take time, committing suicide should not be an option. It’s important to share feelings among family members or loved ones because together as a family any problem can be overcome.
Embrace the unknown and focus on enhancing your life, instead of worrying about what will happen next. Always find time for your loved ones, as life is uncertain. We should be grateful that we are alive and accept that change is the only constant thing in life. Do not let the unknown, stop you from trying or achieving your goals and always remember that even if you fail, you still have endless opportunities."

Don't Miss,"Arika Gurung in Kathmandu
For 19 years, Arika Gurung’s story had not been told. No one knew who she was or what she looked like. However, over the last week or so, her name has echoed throughout the nation. On October 7, all her hard work paid off as she became the only Nepali athlete to win a silver medal in karate at the Asian Games this year. 
Arika Gurung is no stranger to the world of sports. The recently held 19th Asian Games marked her second international competition, with several domestic competitions also in her portfolio. What is interesting is that Gurung only made her international debut one-and-a-half weeks before the Asian Games in China.
Her debut was quite memorable as she won a gold and a bronze medal at the 10th Shitoryu Karatedo International Championships after which she flew to China to compete in the Asian Games.
She believes that her success and experience there also helped her to bag medals in China. 
“We identified our mistake during the competition in Indonesia,” she says, “By rectifying that error, we performed admirably in the Asian Games.”
Win or learn
Arika Gurung after winning her bout in the Asian Games held in China.
In the 68-kg weight category, there were a total of eight players including Gurung. Gurung started her bouts directly from the quarter-finals. Winning one fight ensured she would win a bronze medal, winning two fights secured a silver medal, and three victories would have resulted in a gold medal. Understanding this, she defeated Japanese player Yuzuki Sawae in her first fight and Hong Kong’s Yan Kai Ho in the semi-finals.
Her final bout was against Sofya Berultseva from Kazakhstan, someone she had followed religiously. She was up against someone she had thoroughly studied in preparation for the match. However, she soon received a reality check when all the videos she had watched prior to the fight proved to be ineffective. She lost to the world champion and had to settle for a silver medal.
“It was a great experience. I learnt a lot and will use that knowledge in future matches,” says Gurung.

Although her aim was to secure the gold, Gurung said she was disappointed in not being able to achieve this goal. 
“It is a bittersweet feeling,” says Gurung who is only the third athlete to win a silver medal for Nepal in the history of the Asian Games.
Winning medals and hopes
This made her the talk of the town. While she anticipated celebrations in her village in Nilakantha municipality-13 in Dhading for her success, she was taken aback by the nationwide reaction to the news of her winning a silver medal.
“I thought I had won one mere fight. But I didn’t know that there would be so much love and support from Nepal. Looking at it now, I am very lucky and happy. It is a proud moment for me.”
But she feels that now the country as well as Nepali society, government and supporters’ hopes and expectations for her have increased. Therefore, she assures that she will improve her game and focus on bettering her game in the coming days.
Her victory in the qualifiers earned her a spot in the Asian Games and introduced her to international competitions. This also led to her first participation in the national team’s closed training sessions.

Under the guidance of coach Kushal Shrestha, she, along with other players, had been diligently preparing for the past nine months. 
“She is amazing. In the past nine months, she has not taken one day off. This medal is the reward for the hard work she has put in,” says Shrestha.
Arika Gurung was the tallest athlete in the 68 kg weight category, and her height gave her an undoubted advantage. 
“Her arms and legs display remarkable agility, effortlessly moving without hesitation during the game,” says Shrestha.
He also expressed his confidence in her abilities, expecting her to achieve a medal due to her diligence.
“She is an exceptionally high-achieving individual. She has the potential to reach even greater heights, unfortunately, karate was removed from the Olympics,” he says.
Although karate will not be part of the 2024 Olympics in Paris, Shrestha remains optimistic about its inclusion in the Olympics 2028. 
“If it is reintroduced later, we want to start preparing her for the Olympics 2028.”
Proud mother
After landing in Kathmandu, when Arika Gurung was busy giving interviews, her mother, Ratna, could be seen enthusiastically peeking from the background.
Arika Gurung’s mother, Ratna.
Holding a bouquet of flowers in hand that Arika Gurung received and witnessing the love her daughter was getting, Ratna was gleaming with happiness. Her father, who is a trekking guide, was not there to welcome her as he was in Phapla and there were no flights to bring him to Kathmandu.
Her parents were often told to try for a son. But Ranta never game attention to that and believed that her two daughters were more than enough.
“I always told Arika that she is as valuable as any son would be,” Ratna says.
That has always given Arika Gurung the belief that she can do anything. Her mother says once Arika sets her mind on something, she has a tendency to see it through and achieve it no matter what. She even picked up hockey at an early age. It is a sport that she has deep affection for even to this day.
The right timing
Arika Gurung’s coach Kushal Shrestha
In the past, Nepal had two separate federations for karate, causing uncertainty among players regarding their participation in international tournaments despite their year-round efforts and dedication.
However, in January, the National Sports Council successfully mediated the conflict and amalgamated the two federations into a single entity. Following the election of the new leadership in March, the disputes within the karate community were effectively resolved.
Former player and coach Shrestha highlighted it was a positive outcome, “Previously, players were often unsure about their participation. But with the new trajectory, players will no longer face such confusion and can solely concentrate on their games. This shift, undoubtedly, contributed to our confidence to win medals.”
In the past, Nepal had secured three bronze medals in karate – Sita Rai in 1994, Samar Bahadur Gole in 1998, and Bimala Tamang in 2014.
Although they had set their sights on securing three or four medals at the Asian Games, they are a bit disappointed about not achieving their target. 
Shrestha says insufficient exposure affected their performance against top-ranked opponents.  
“The tie sheet also posed some challenge for us, as the players’ first match was scheduled against a top player,” Shrestha says.
Regardless, coach Shrestha says that he views Arika Gurung’s recent success as a promising beginning for the Nepali karate sector. With enhanced exposure and opportunities, Nepali players will yield better results in upcoming tournaments."

2023 Asian Games: Arika Gurung secures silver in karate
","The auction of the Nepal Super League (NSL) was full of new faces.
Due to the ongoing player crisis in Nepali football, NSL, Nepal’s only franchise football league has seen a major facelift since its first edition back in 2021.
Nine teams are taking part in this year’s edition after Biratnagar City FC pulled out of the tournament. Out of the nine marquee players for the 2023 edition, only three were marquee players in the first edition, highlighting the significant changes that have taken place since then.
Bishal Shrestha, Bikesh Kuthu, and Anjan Bista are the sole marquee players from the inaugural edition. However, they have all switched teams from their 2021 affiliations, with Shrestha now representing FC Chitwan, Kuthu playing for Sporting Ilam FC de Mechi, and Bista joining Jhapa FC.
The newly appointed marquee players include Ananta Tamang, Hishub Thapaliya, Aashish Chaudhary, Arik Bista, Ayush Ghalan, and Deep Karki. They will be representing Lalitpur City FC, Kathmandu Rayzrs, Dhangadhi FC, Butwal Lumbini FC, Pokhara Thunders, and Birgunj United FC, respectively.
Ghalan made a significant impact in the 2021 edition after being discovered through a talent hunt organized by Pokhara Thunders. Thapaliya and Chaudhary, who showcased their skills in the recently concluded A Division League, are set to make their debut in the NSL.
This year’s auction featured a total of 179 Nepali players, with 28 falling into Category A, 81 in Category B, and 70 in Category C. Out of this pool, 120 players were selected to join various teams, leaving 59 players unsold for the tournament.
The second edition of the NSL will take place from November 25 onwards.
Nepal Super League marquee players.
Ilam going with experience
Under the guidance of coach Meghraj KC, the newly formed team Sporting Ilam de Mechi, featuring a roster of seasoned players, is set to make their debut in the NSL. Former champion with Kathmandu Rayzrs, goalkeeper Bikesh Khutu will captain the team.
Ilam will be bolstered by the presence of experienced players like former national team captain Biraj Maharjan, Bharat Khawas, Bimal Pandey, and Navin Lama.
In their pursuit of strengthening the team, Ilam acquired Biraj Maharjan, Ashish Gurung and Navin Lama from the A category. Notably, Lama’s inclusion in the team was confirmed during the second round of selections. Among these three players, Gurung is a new addition, while the other two bring with them a wealth of experience.
Jhapa on the attack
Jhapa will likely rely on its attack to try to win the NSL in its debut season. Anjan Bista serves as the marquee player for Jhapa. The team also boasts one of the most formidable lineups in this year’s NSL. This team appears to have achieved a balanced composition across midfield, forward, and defence.
Laken Limbu was eagerly sought after by nine teams from the A category before ultimately being acquired by Jhapa. Prashant Laksam Limbu, who earned acclaim as a midfielder during the U19 SAFF Championship category, also found his way to Jhapa via a lucky draw. Defender Tsiring Lama made his way to Jhapa.
Adding to their roster, Jhapa secured goalkeeper Anish Deula from Jawalakhel Youth Club. The team invested Rs 2.05 million to acquire 13 players from the auction. Among them, Jhapa selected 3 from Category A, 6 from Category B, and 4 from Category C.
Youthful Pokhara
With youngster Ayush Ghalan as their marquee player, Pokhara has decided to go with young players to take part in this year’s NSL. Coached by Nabin Neupane, Pokhara will be looking to run their opponents out of the park. They made significant strides in the auctions by securing 10 players even before the auction of the remaining 100 players concluded.
Among their acquisitions, Pokhara has added defender Anjal Maharjan, midfielder Suraju Thakuri, and forward Sanjeev Bista.
Lalitpur believes defence wins you titles
‘Attack wins you games, defence wins you titles’. Believing in these famous words by Sir Alex Ferguson, Lalitpur City FC have built a team around the best defenders in the country.
The marquee player Ananta Tamang will be alongside defenders Sanish Shrestha and Sesehang Angdembe. Dinesh Henjan will lead the line for Lalitpur who will rely on their defence to take them to the championship.
Birgunj’s mixed bag
Birgunj United is also debuting in the NSL this season and chose goalkeeper Deep Karki as their marquee player. The team has a young and talented midfield which will have Subas Gurung and Sudip Gurung. Forward Sunil Khadka will be tasked with scoring goals for the team along with a bunch of foreign players who will have to step up for them.
Unlucky Butwal Lumbini FC
Butwal Lumbini FC was the unluckiest team in this year’s auction after losing out on players through the lucky draw. They were also forced to acquire two players from Category A in the second round. Nevertheless, the team maintains a balanced composition.
Chitwan balanced approach
Chitwan FC had an indifferent auction. The team will rely on the leadership of Bishal Shreshta who is their marquee player. The team also has a balanced squad with a blend of both young and old players. Tsering Gurung, Simanta Thapa and Ekraj Budhathoki will strengthen the defence, while Utsav Rai will be their workhorse in midfield and Navayug Shrestha will lead the line.
Strong Dhangadhi
In the second edition of the NSL, Dhangadhi FC, led by their young player Ashish Chaudhary as the marquee, presents itself as a well-balanced team. Devendra Tamang, a dependable player for the national team, strengthens their defence. Kritish Ratna Chhunju will want to be a highly reliable asset in the midfield while Tikendra Singh Thapa will be ensuring he keeps a clean sheet.
Changed Kathmandu
Kathmandu Rayzrs celebrate winning the inaugural Nepal Super League in 2021.
Defending champions Kathmandu Rayzrs look completely new for this year’s NSL. Hishub Thapaliya will feature as the marquee player for Kathmandu Rayzrs for this year’s NSL while goalkeeper Jiyarath Sheikh, who earned recognition as the best in the U-19 category, will also be a part of the Kathmandu squad.
The defence is likely to be led by Anjan Rai while their midfield will be controlled by Dipesh Gurung and Prashant Awasthi. With former captain Bikesh Kuthu and star forward Messouke Oloumou missing, the team will try to defend its title with a youthful team."

Kathmandu, October 1
Nepal cricket team have continued their impressive start to the Asian Games by beating Maldives by 138 runs.
Winning both group games, Nepal have reached the quarter-final of the Asian Games cricket.
Winning the toss, Nepal chose to bat first and did not have the best start. Despite some power hitting by Kushal Bhurtel, Nepal were reduced to 67 for four and Nepal’s middle order struggled. 
The innings was anchored by captain Rohit Paudel who came down the order. Paudel was impressive as he top-scored with 52 from only 27 balls. He was helped by Gulshan Jha who scored 35 off 21 balls. An explosive hitting from Kushal Malla took Nepal to an impressive 212 in the allotted 20 overs.
In reply, the Maldives did not look comfortable losing their first wicket in the second ball of the innings. Wickets continued to fall with Abinash Bohara taking three in a single over reducing Maldives to 16 for four. Bohara was the pick of the bowlers picking up six wickets. He was on a hat trick twice. 
Nepali bowlers continued to pile on the pressure and they kept chipping in with wickets to bowl them out for 74 winning the game by 138 runs.
Nepal will either face India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka or Bangladesh. A draw will be conducted to decide who they will play."

2023 Asian Games: Understrength India beat Nepal
","Kushal Malla
Kathmandu, September 27
Nepal broke seven world records during their demolishing victory over Mongolia in the 19th Asian Games being held in Hangzhou.
Here are the records Nepal broke during the victory:
1. Highest score
Nepal scored 314 runs in the allotted 20 overs. This is the highest T20I score recorded so far. It is also the only 300-plus score recorded in T20 internationals.
Afghanistan’s 278 against Ireland was the highest score prior to Nepal’s demolition of Mongolia on Wednesday in the Asian Games.
2. Highest run rate
With Nepal scoring 314, the team also has the record for the highest run rate. Nepal scored the runs at 15.7 which again broke Afghanistan’s record against Ireland when they scored at 13.9.
3. Sixes galore
Scoring all those runs needed a lot of sixes and it was raining sixes in Hangzhou. Nepali batters, on course to score 314, hit 26 sixes. Kushal Malla hit 12 sixes, Dipendra Singh Airee hit eight and Rohit Paudel hit six. 
Compared to 26 sixes, Nepal only hit 14 fours.

4. Fastest 100
Kushal Malla was on a mission on Wednesday as he launched the ball all over the park. Malla’s 34-ball century surpassed David Miller’s 35-ball record against Bangladesh, showcasing exceptional power-hitting.
Malla finished the game with an impressive score of 137 runs, marking it as the fifth-highest score ever recorded in a T20 international match.
5. Fastest 50
Dipendre Singh Airee made the most of some bellow-par bowling, sending almost all 10 balls he faced over the boundary. He hammered eight sixes, with six of them coming in his first six balls, scoring 50 in just nine balls. This stands as the fastest-recorded 50 in world cricket, a remarkable feat unlikely to be surpassed anytime soon.
6. Highest strike rate
Airee’s power hitting also gave him another record – the highest strike rate. Scoring 52 runs in 10 legal deliveries, Airee scored at a strike rate of 520.
Previously, this record was held by Dwayne Smith of West Indies. On September 13, 2007, in a match against Bangladesh, he scored 29 runs off only 7 balls, boasting an extraordinary strike rate of 414.28.
7. Margin of victory
By defeating Mongolia by a margin of 273 runs, Nepal is now the record holder for the largest margin of victory in T20 International matches. The previous record was set on August 30, 2019, when the Czech Republic triumphed over Turkey by a margin of 257 runs."

Kathmandu, September 27
Nepal cricket team broke multiple T20I records during their 273-run victory over Mongolia during the 19th Asian Games in Hangzhou. This is the highest margin of victory in a T20 International.
Put to bat first, Nepal batted mercilessly as they looked to hit every ball towards the boundary. Despite losing openers Kushal Bhurtel and Aasif Sheikh, the middle order put Mongolia to the sword with some top-class power hitting. 
Kushal Malla scored the fastest T20I century in just 34 balls. He finished with 134 in 50 balls. Captin Rohit Paudel also punished the Mongolian bowlers hitting an impressive 61 of 27 balls.
The star of the show, however, was Dipendra Singh Airee who scored the fastest 50 in any format. Airee faced 10 balls hitting eight sixes and reaching his 50 in just nine deliveries. He hit his first six deliveries out of the ground as Nepal put on a record 314 runs in 20 overs. 
In reply, Mongolia were bowled out for 41 runs. The batters had no answer to Nepal’s bowling which dominated from the start. Karan KC, Abinash Bohora and Sandeep Lamichhane took two wickets while Sompal Kami, Kushal Bhurtel and Dipendra Singh Airee took a wicket each.
With this win, Nepal have all but qualified for the quarter-finals where they will face either India, Pakistan, Bangladesh or Sri Lanka."

The case, however, has been adjourned indefinitely. The Kathmandu District Court says it does not have judges to hear the case.
As the date for the next hearing in the case remains uncertain, Lamichhane is considering joining Nepal’s cricket team in China, as they participate in the 19th Asian Games held in Hangzhou.
Lamichhane, in a meeting with CAN President Chatur Bahadur Chand on Sunday, said he was not mentally ready to be a part of the team.
Lamichhane met Chand and CAN secretary Paras Khadka on Monday and told them he was not ready to play cricket until the final verdict was out.

Asian Games 2023: Nepal reach the quarter-final after an easy victory over the Maldives
","As untouched and less discussed as the sports management industry is in Nepal, it has ample room to showcase creativity. Photo by Miguel Bruna on Unsplash
In 2023, Barbie named Women in Sports as their career of the year.
Whenever I am out and about socially, there is always someone who seems pretty certain about not considering my profession as mainstream. Hold up! Sports as a career? In Nepal? You bet! This article aims to explain why women in this male-dominant sports industry in Nepal should not be viewed as a surprise.
I have been part of the Nepali cricket industry in a private capacity for quite a while now. Armed with a Master’s Degree in IT from an American University, my choice to stick with sports management tends to raise eyebrows. While I am not an on-field player, I am definitely behind the scenes, playing strong games of serious deliverance with my team. We are all about creating what is not there.
As untouched and less discussed as the sports management industry is in Nepal, it has ample room to showcase creativity. Being a commanding woman in a position can be challenging, but on the brighter side, the gender advantage has yet to fail me. As alien as I might be in sports management in Nepal, I have been accepted with open arms. The nature of the job is highly competitive, no doubt.
Embraced by the sports fraternity

Women in sports are safe, heard, and welcomed. I absolutely relish the addition of spirited women to the team. The nuances of sports are something women complement greatly. Sports management inherently rejects narrow minds. There is a lot of travelling, meeting people, experimenting, and remembering limitations. The adjustments are both trivial and clever. 
Often, in our part of the world, societal norms limit women from making career decisions, hindering them from living life on their terms. This restriction potentially keeps many capable women from pursuing the sports industry, where they could truly wield their power to make an impact. Change is gradual, and I hope to see numerous female faces in charge of stadiums someday in Nepal.
Yes, there are challenges. It ranges from personal sacrifices to job security and opportunities. However, these are workable factors for any freelancer in sports management. The key is excelling at our jobs to thrive anywhere. 
Taking a page from the medical field, the seriousness we apply there should not differ in sports management. Sports is a powerful industry. Children grow up idolising what we showcase on TV. As glorious as the game is, it is every child’s dream to represent their country someday. Carrying that responsibility is our role in sports—an often thankless yet deeply satisfying job.
Nepali sports industry
The fans went wild at TU Cricket Ground after Nepal beat UAE.
Sports may be a smaller industry in Nepal, but globally, it is a behemoth. The world economy has shifted, and it is time we alter our perspective to recognise the potential of sports as an industry in Nepal. The idea of open commercialisation of sports remains somewhat unexplored, as it continues to be a more exclusive affair in Nepal. 
By sourcing innovative ideas, there’s a wealth of public attention and investment waiting to be tapped into, along with numerous practices to establish and discard. As the Nepali team achieves international records, the packaging of the sport becomes everything. There is plenty to learn from international sports management to make our industry highly marketable and poised for global entry.
Sports such as cricket, football, volleyball, or even golf serve as key intersections for reshaping Nepal’s global narrative. Over the years, Kabaddi has witnessed a substantial surge in India, both in terms of viewership and commercial success. The primary challenge we grapple with is Nepal’s comparatively small market size, posing constraints on our ability to generate substantial economic gains. Therefore, there is unanimous agreement on the imperative for Nepal’s sports to venture onto the international stage.
Nepal boasts many hardworking individuals, yet achieving this goal demands specialised talents in sports management with the requisite experience and the capacity to enhance existing values. In the long run, outsourcing such talents may foster dependence. Hence, a concerted effort is needed to inspire Nepali youth to engage in sports management, contributing to our sports ecosystem. 
There are various ways in which we can harness the potential of sports for our benefit. Encouraging youth involvement can be instrumental in capitalising on the multifaceted opportunities presented by the sports industry. There is a lot to explore if you think about it."

Asian Games 2023: PUB-G team reaches the semi-final
","Painting ‘My Private Life’ by artist Priyam Pradhan at the exhibition Mani at Siddhartha Art Gallery, Baber Mahal. Photo: Chandra Bahadur Ale
Using Pitt’s artist pen on paper, artist Priyam Pradhan presents My Private Life, a showcase of the current significance of his life depicted in abstract form.
At the centre of the painting is a 1000-rupee note, within which Pradhan has intricately painted Lord Krishna, a man wearing a hoodie tenderly embracing his dog, and a woman. The woman stands tall, elongated in form. Towards the bottom of the canvas, a holy man reaches out his hands, appearing to be in flight.
Priyam Pradhan has used a vibrant colour palette, incorporating bright hues such as pink, orange, and yellow, as well as green, black, white, and grey. This combination adds a dynamic and lively quality to the artwork.
“The man in the centre is me and the girl in green is my girlfriend. And the faces are my mom and dad,” says Pradhan. “The sadhu (holy man) symbolises my desires that I don’t have many desires for materialistic things however I do understand the value of money.”
The use of colours, figures and lines in an abstract form in his painting resembles the painting of American painter Paul Jackson Pollock. Like his abstract expressionism, Pradhan has expressed himself in his painting.
Furthermore, this marks Priyam Pradhan’s third solo painting exhibition titled Mani (money), inaugurated on January 17 at Siddhartha Art Gallery, Baber Mahal.
In his previous exhibitions, Pradhan’s artworks centred around Hindu philosophy and his spontaneous thought process. However, in this latest exhibition, he explores the theme of money and its impact on an individual’s life, delving into the reverberating effects of financial aspects.
Understanding the value of money

Any form of art is known as a reflection of the contemporary time. Likewise, Priyam Pradhan’s paintings reflect the lifestyle, desires, obligations and more of today’s younger generation living in urban areas in Nepal.
Pradhan himself is in his 20s and he has justified the want of most of the youngsters in their 20s, who might be declared adults and understand the need for money and materialistic things but are still kids at their heart who want to explore and experience life as much as possible.
The exhibition has 27 paintings which Pradhan took around nine months to complete. According to him, while he was travelling the idea that his life was luxurious and him being capable of exploring anything he wanted to was because of money.
And being an artist this concept lingered on him and he was compelled to create on the theme of money.
Once you enter the gallery, you can also view an animated video, which introduces artist Pradhan and the importance of money, which is on the ground floor. On the first floor, a huge painting (193×62 in cm) Apatkalin Awastha using mixed media on canvas welcomes you and other paintings are small in size (18×30 in cm).
“It is a team work and it is my introduction as an artist for the exhibition,” he says. “Also, being a recent multimedia graduate from Islington College, I wanted to explore my skills and I got my team. Then, like money, multimedia is relevant to current society.”
Experiencing life through art
Painting by artist Priyam Pradhan at Siddhartha Art Gallery, Baber Mahal. Photo: Chandra Bahadur Ale 
Priyam Pradhan says enjoyment is the meaning of life and he enjoys creating artwork. Moreover, Pradhan who came into the art world first being a tattoo artist feels blessed that he has the privilege to explore whatever he likes in his life.
He also believes that the philosophy that says one should not be materialistic is wrong. “If material things are not important, why would one build a house? And after building a house why do they want to decorate their house?” he questions.
Alongside, money and materialistic things, his paintings also explore love, romance, life and childhood experiences. Motifs like Pokemon, ramen noodles, animals, dancers, etc have been used in his paintings. In most of his paintings, he has used numerous white lines in wavy form and these lines for Pradhan indicate the sound or the energy that exists in the surroundings all the time.
About using a pitta artist pen, he says, “I have enjoyed drawing and painting since my childhood and using a pitta artist pen helps me revisit that feeling of happiness and sense of freedom.”
So many things happening on the canvas with the use of vibrant colours gives a sense of excitement to the viewers. Though referencing artists like Pollock, MF Husain, Picasso and more, his pen strokes give a sense of newness through his expression and thoughts about his life experiences.
In his paintings, these bright colours and motifs are in harmony and are visual treats that can surely cheer up the mood of any visitor. Moreover, you can also get free stickers from the artist.
If you too are in a gloomy mood and want to uplift a little, visit the exhibition that continues till February 6."

U19 SAFF Championship: Heartbreak for Nepal after losing to India on penalties
","Entrepreneurship education is not just an investment in the education system; it is an investment in the nation’s future prosperity. Photo: Pexels/ Rodnae Productions
In the shadow of the towering Himalayas, Nepal faces a challenge that rivals the steepness of its mountainous terrain- the challenge of economic development. As the nation earnestly pursues its Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), it becomes increasingly evident that a transformation in the education system is not only necessary but also urgent. 
Rooted in common living strategies, the prevailing education model, especially in higher education, may not adequately prepare the youth for the demands of the modern world. 
In this critical juncture, the incorporation of entrepreneurship education emerges as a beacon of hope, offering a pathway towards a self-reliant and prosperous Nepal.
Time to reevaluate the education system
Nepal’s journey towards economic prosperity has been marked by challenges that demand innovative solutions. The commitment of the SDGs reflects not only a global responsibility but also a domestic imperative for sustainable development. For this, it is high time to reevaluate the education system in the country.
The current education system in Nepal, deeply entrenched in common living strategies, has been the foundation of learning for generations. However, in the face of a rapidly evolving world, today’s generation aspires for more than the status quo. The call for independence reverberates through the aspirations of youth who seek a curriculum fostering critical thinking, innovation and entrepreneurial skills.
Entrepreneurship education is a dynamic force capable of reshaping Nepal’s educational landscape. This innovative approach moves beyond traditional learning methods, providing students with the tools to navigate the complexities of the modern world. At its core, entrepreneurship education is about empowering students to implement learned information in practical and tangible ways.
Consider a student engrossed in the intricacies of sensor systems during a science class, entrepreneurship education transforms this theoretical knowledge into practical applications, inspiring the creation of a sensor-operated door. Such innovation born from a fusion of science and entrepreneurship becomes a valuable mindset in solving practical problems.  
Expanding the horizons of entrepreneurship education, let us delve into chemistry. Imagine students studying chemistry not just as a theoretical subject, but also as entrepreneurs in the making. Armed with entrepreneurial principles, these students can tap into Nepal’s rich biodiversity, exploring market demands for products derived from local plants.
In the scenario, chemistry students could embark on a journey to develop performance-enhancing products based on market demand, harnessing the potential of indigenous flora. What makes this approach remarkable is that it does not necessarily require sophisticated machines or extensive human resources. Instead, it leverages the inherent skills and awareness of individuals within the community, paving the way for a grassroots economic revolution.
Entrepreneurship in education 
Representational graphic. Image: Freepik
The beauty of entrepreneurship education lies in its universal applicability. It is not confined to science or chemistry alone. Consider an art student, for example. Through entrepreneurship education, they can understand what art to develop (product), how much to set the price (price), where to sell (place) and how to sell (promote) their artworks. Every subject becomes a canvas for innovation and enterprise.
Moreover, entrepreneurship education is a powerful equaliser, recognising the unique skills and talents of individuals across various disciplines. It is not about fitting into a predefined mould but rather about unleashing the potential within each student. When every single person is aware of their skills and potential, they can rise to different levels, contributing to the overall progress of the nation.
Entrepreneurship education goes beyond skill recognition; it is about nurturing the ability to produce goods and mastering the art of marketing. Returning to the example of the student developing a sensor-operated door, entrepreneurship education not only equips them to produce the product but also teaches them how to navigate the complexities of marketing it to potential users and clients.
The impact of entrepreneurship education extends beyond individual success stories; it reverberates through the entire nation. A generation equipped with entrepreneurial skills becomes a driving force for economic growth and independence. They will be able to recognise the resources and ideas to utilise them to reach the global market. They will be able to be the pioneers in products and contribute to the economy. By fostering a culture of innovation, creativity and self-reliance, Nepal can reduce its dependence on external sources and strengthen its economy from within.
In essence, entrepreneurship education is not just an investment in the education system; it is an investment in the nation’s future prosperity. It is a transformative force that has the potential to shape a generation of independent thinkers, innovators and entrepreneurs- the architects of a self-reliant and economically vibrant Nepal. Entrepreneurship education, by teaching students to utilise available resources (physical and financial) and make them commercial, becomes a cornerstone in the nation’s journey towards economic empowerment and independence."

Sandeep Lamichhane off to China to take part in the Asian Games
","Ram Bujhaun Yadav with his land ownership certificate stands near a border pillar which he says was erroneously placed on his land. 
In October 2023, when 51-year-old Ram Bujhaun Yadav of Musaharnia Rural Municipality-5, Mukhiyapatti, Dhanusha, was at a relative’s house, someone told him that two Indian Sashastra Seema Bal (SSB) personnel were looking for him.
Anxious, he rushed home wondering why they were looking for him.
“They asked me if the paddy field in the no man’s land was mine. I told them yes and they asked me to cut down the paddy immediately,” he said.
The paddy was not ripe and Yadav asked them for some time. However, the SSB personnel told him he had to cut down his paddy immediately.
Ram Bujhaun and his wife Tetari Devi each own a 677-square-metre plot of land. As Nepal and India reevaluated the border, Ram Bujhan’s land was been deemed to be near the no man’s land as it now has two demarcation pillars.
Frustrated, Ram Bujhaun cut the paddy before it was due to be harvested. Now, he has been asked to not plant anything on the land as it falls in the no man’s land.
“Our border police don’t say a word. I can’t fight the SSB on my own,” says Ram Bujhaun adding he had decided not to plan anything on the land anymore.
Woes of the farmers
Many farmers in southern Nepal say their land has now been placed in India after the recent demarcation. 
When the Jamuna River, which flows through the no man’s land between Nepal and India, changed its course some two decades ago, some border pillars went missing. Locals say these pillars have now been placed encroaching on Nepali land.
In 2018, with the then Chief District Officer of Dhanusha, Pradeep Raj Kandel, and an official from Madhubani district, Bihar, India, a team that included border security forces from both countries, the Armed Police Force of Nepal, and SSB of India began placing border pillars after land measurement by technicians.
Locals have raised concerns, stating that border pillars have been positioned, encroaching approximately 50 to 100 meters of land into Nepal compared to the previous position. Many like Ram Bujhaun are unaware of when these border pillars were placed.
“I did not know that pillar was placed here. After I found out when I asked the village leaders, many said they were placing the border pillars as they pleased,” said Ram Bujhaun.
He was told to carry on planting paddy and that it would not matter as these issues had happened in the past. 
“They encroached on my land and have asked me not to plant anything. This is gross injustice,” he says.
Ram Bujhaun’s family owns a total of 4,000 square metres of land, with 2,000 square metres belonging to him and the remaining 2,000 square metres to his brother Bechan. However, 1,000 square metres of his land is now located on the Indian side after the demarcation. Despite this, he has been farming on the land and continues to pay taxes to the Department of Land Management and Archive in Nepal.
“They have marked my land to be on the Indian side and placed border pillars on it. I’ve been farming till now but I don’t know when they will ask me to stop,” he says.
Ignorance of the government
The Madhesh province in southern Nepal
The former ward chair of Mukhiyapatti Musharniya Rural Municipality-5, Ram Naresh Yadav, said that over time, India has encroached on numerous Nepali lands in various locations in the Madhesh Province. This, he says, happened due to the Nepali administration’s ignorance and weak stature.
“They (Nepali administration) were careless and that meant the Indian side placed these border pillars by encroaching on Nepali land,” says Ram Naresh.
He said that over 40 farmers from wards 1, 5, and 6 have land ranging from 300 to 1,600 square metres on the Indian side. 
“These farmers have land ownership certificates, but they cannot farm as the SSB says the land is in India and not Nepal,” said Ram Naresh.
In 1996, land ownership certificates were distributed after surveying the land in the border area. Local Dharmendra Kumar Yadav said that since then, the locals have been paying their land tax regularly. In 2018, when the pillar was being placed, the locals protested when they saw their land was being encroached on. However, since the demarcation had been agreed upon by high-ranking government officials of Nepal and India, the farmer’s voices went unheard.
“We tried to stop when the border pillars were being placed on our land. But the administrators from both sides forcibly put it there without even trying to hold a discussion,” said Harish Chandra Yadav. 
The Chief District Officer of Dhanusha, Chakrapani Pandey, says that the border pillars were placed by the technical team after the measurements and with the agreement of the high-ranking officials of the two countries.
“The fields and houses that are built in no man’s land have recently been cleared. No one can do anything in this particular area,” said Pandey. “We understand the people’s concern but we cannot do anything about it now.”"
Posts navigation,"Regenerative braking representational image. Photo: Freepik
The electric vehicle market in Nepal has grown significantly over the past year. 
Electric four-wheelers and two-wheelers are being launched almost every month, spanning from passenger to commercial vehicles. Electric transportation appears to be an emerging trend in the automotive industry.
New EVs are regularly introduced with advanced features as car companies develop unique electric platforms. One standout feature is regenerative braking.
Regenerative braking was first introduced in 1967 by the American Motor Car Company (AMC) in their prototype electric vehicle, the AMC Amitron. However, Toyota became the automobile manufacturer to implement regenerative braking system (RBS) technology in their Prius series hybrid vehicles in 1997. Toyota brought up the new hybrid technology in the Prius when fuel prices were going up at a massive rate.

But what is regenerative braking? There are still many people confused about what it is, whether it is safe or helpful in fuel economy in hybrid cars and the regeneration of electricity in electric cars.
In simple terms, regen braking is when a car saves energy by recharging its battery when you brake, helping it use less fuel or electricity and go further. Easy but scientifically, regen braking is a process used in vehicles where the kinetic energy produced during braking is converted into electrical energy through an electric motor acting as a generator. This electrical energy is then stored in the vehicle’s battery for later use, reducing energy wastage and increasing overall efficiency.

Regen braking can be seen in all kinds of EVs, including cars, scooters, commercial vans, buses, bicycles, three-wheelers, and rickshaws. It now can be electrically managed to what extent the power and braking can be generated. 
Regenerative Braking work process in EV

Principle of Operation: Regene braking works by turning the energy from slowing down into electricity.
Electric Motor as a Generator: In EV or hybrid cars with regen braking, the motor changes roles from moving the car to making electricity when you brake.
Switching Polarity: When you brake, the motor switches directions, turning energy from the wheels into electricity instead of using it to move the car.
Generation of Electricity: The turning wheels make the motor produce electricity, which goes to the car’s battery.
Power Electronics: Special electronics change the electricity from the motor into the right kind for charging the battery.
Battery Charging: The electricity made during braking charges up the car’s battery, storing the energy for later.
Integration with Hydraulic Braking System: Regenerative braking works with the regular brakes, blending them for smooth stopping.

Advantages and Disadvantages of Regenerative Braking 
The advantages are listed below:

Energy Efficiency: Regenerative braking efficiently captures the kinetic energy generated during braking, effectively reducing energy wastage and contributing to a more sustainable driving experience.
Extended Range: By using the energy that would otherwise be lost during braking as heat and sound, regenerative braking helps to extend the driving range of electric vehicles in instances such as travelling downhill. 
Reduced Brake Wear: Regenerative braking minimizes the strain on traditional braking components, mitigating wear and tear, and potentially extending the lifespan of the braking components such as brake pads, rotors and brake lines, thus reducing maintenance costs over time.
Enhanced Driving Experience: Regenerative braking provides a smoother braking experience and a more responsive feel to drivers, enhancing overall driving comfort and control on the road.

The disadvantages are listed below:

Limited Effectiveness at Low Speeds: While regenerative braking efficiently recaptures energy during braking, its effectiveness diminishes at lower speeds which leads to decreased energy recovery compared to higher speeds.
Complexity and Cost: Implementing regenerative braking adds complexity and cost to vehicle systems, potentially raising manufacturing and maintenance expenses, and impacting consumer affordability.
Maintenance Requirements: Regenerative braking systems require periodic maintenance and calibration to ensure they operate optimally.
Efficiency Variability: Regenerative braking may exhibit variability in efficiency under extreme weather conditions or on certain road surfaces, leading to fluctuations in overall energy recapture and impacting the vehicle’s efficiency.

Misconceptions

Fully Recharges Battery: Some mistakenly believe that regenerative braking fully replenishes the battery, but in reality, it only adds a modest amount of charge.
Increases Braking Distances: There is a misconception that regenerative braking extends braking distances, but it enhances braking performance by complementing traditional brakes.
High-Speed Only: While more effective at higher speeds, regenerative braking still functions at lower speeds, such as during city driving or stop-and-go traffic.
Maintenance-Free: Despite requiring less maintenance than traditional brakes, regen braking systems still need periodic checks and maintenance to ensure proper operation.
Significantly Boosts Range: While regen braking contributes to extending the driving range of electric vehicles, its impact is influenced by various factors beyond just braking efficiency.
Only for Electric Cars: Although commonly associated with electric vehicles, regen braking systems are also found in some conventional vehicles, particularly those aiming to improve fuel efficiency with advanced technology.

Regenerative braking might sound complicated, but it is pretty cool. Think of it as a way for EVs and hybrids to recycle energy when they slow down. Instead of just wasting that energy, regenerative braking turns it into electricity, which can then be used to power the battery."

Women in sports management can make a difference

As the gates to the vet clinic at the Central Zoo in Lalitpur opened, more than two dozen photojournalists thronged the facility and surrounded a metal cage aiming their DSLR cameras at a snow leopard inside.
“Please don’t come close to the animal,” the zoo’s vet, Radha Krishna Gharti, told approaching photojournalists. But in the gush of excitement to take exclusive photographs of the elusive cat, difficult to spot even in its prime habitats, there were few takers for the word of caution.
Nepal’s Department of National Parks and Wildlife Conservation (DNPWC) organised the photo-op two days after the male subadult cat, which was until recently found in the country only at altitudes higher than 2,000-6,000 metres above sea level, was brought to the zoo from Urlabari town(146 m above sea level). According to the department, the animal has sustained injuries to its right foreleg and cannot stand upright.
Although officials involved said they are looking at releasing the animal into the wild after it recuperates, doing so will be a daunting task, adding that the zoo may be the only place where it can now survive.
Not a wild cat

“Nepali snow leopard experts have come up with two hypotheses to explain how the animal from the mountains landed up in the plains,” said Sharad Chandra Adhikari, member-secretary at the National Trust for Nature Conservation (NTNC), a semi-government body that manages the zoo in Lalitpur, a town in the Kathmandu Valley. 
The first of the two hypotheses made public during the photo-op-cum-press conference, is that it was raised in captivity and somehow managed to escape into the wild. The second is that it lost its orientation while trying to establish its territory after separating from its mother.
Kulbhushansingh Suryawanshi, director of the India program, Snow Leopard Trust, said that both hypotheses are plausible explanations as to how the snow leopard got to the plains in Nepal.
A DNPWC official, who wished to remain anonymous as he is not authorised to talk to the press, said that it was more likely that the animal had been raised in captivity. 
“The way it sipped the water and ate the food zoo staff offered indicates that it may have been raised in captivity,” the official said.
Snow leopards are shy cats living at extreme altitudes in the steep mountainous areas of 12 countries in Central and South Asia. Their global population spread over altitudes of 500-5,800 m, is estimated to be between around 3,900 and 6,000 as detailed coordinated surveys of the population in the range countries are yet to be carried out. In Nepal, their population divided into three blocks (eastern, central and western) is estimated to be between 301 and 400.
Adhikari from NTNC said that researchers will now examine the animal’s scat to analyse its diet and try to find out whether it was roaming in the wild or had been in some sort of captivity. Researchers are also preparing to analyse its genes to try to find out to which of the three metapopulations in Nepal it belongs. They will also observe the animal’s canine teeth and fur to look for clues.
Relocation challenge

The whole process could take a few months to complete, and summer could set in in Kathmandu by then, officials concede. 
“The current temperature in Kathmandu is suitable for snow leopards, as we are in the peak of winter,” said Madhu Chetri, a snow leopard researcher from NTNC. But that could change as spring season begins in the Northern Hemisphere.
The DNPWC official said that regardless of the findings related to how the animal got to Urlabarli, the animal would have spent a significant amount of time with humans during its recovery phase. “That would mean that it would have gotten habituated with having humans around,” the official said.
Sending such animals back into the wild is a challenge, as they may have lost their hunting and other adaptation skills, he added. In May last year, officials at the Chitwan National Park released two rescued rhino calves into the wild, with limited success. The safety of the animals, which had gotten used to having humans around, was compromised as poachers could easily approach and kill them. Eventually, they were transferred to an enclosure in eastern Nepal away from human intervention.
Veteran conservationist Professor Karan Bahadur Shah said that rewilding the snow leopard would be a daunting task, as the animals are territorial. “If we just leave the animal in its natural habitat, it will get killed by other snow leopards defending their territory,” he said. “The best option would be to keep the animal in the zoo for the public to see.”
But Nepal’s Central Zoo has its own set of problems. The facility, established in 1932 as a private collection, has limited space and has frequently run into financial trouble. Conservationists say the snow leopard would need special facilities to cater to its needs.
“If the government decides that the snow leopard needs to remain at the zoo, we are ready to shoulder the responsibility,” said Adhikari. “We have set up special facilities for animals such as the red panda and chimpanzees,” he said. “We can do that for the snow leopard as well.”
Those advocating for keeping the animal in the zoo also said that Nepal is a snow leopard range country and the public, especially the young generation, also needs to see the different animals found in the country. “It has great educational value,” said Shah.
Snow leopard expert Suryawanshi from neighbouring India also said that it would be challenging to release the animal into the wild. 
“If the team at the zoo can establish the exact cause of this behaviour [why it ventured into the plains] and can keep the animal away from human contact, then it might be okay to release it back,” he said. “But otherwise, there is little hope for it in the wild. Better to let it live in the zoo.”
Back at the zoo, after the photojournalists are done taking photos, it is the turn of the reporters to point their smartphones at the animal. Then there is a contingent of senior wildlife department officials waiting in line to catch a glimpse of the animal. 
“So much for keeping it away from human contact,” a conservationist observing the hullabaloo from a distance said.

Priyam Pradhan explores the essence of money and life in ‘Mani’ 
","The National Assembly was formed to give experienced people a chance to be part of the parliament and help during the formation of important bills. In countries that follow the Westminster model of government, the upper house plays an important role. That, however, is not the case in Nepal as the country’s upper house has become a platform where individuals secure positions in the National Assembly based on their connections. As the election nears, many once again question the relevance and existence of the upper house.
Things were different in the past as the initial years of the National Assembly saw experienced politicians and experts others in their field be nominated for the post. That slowly changed as the first batch completed its two-year term.
“I understand why people are frustrated with the upper house. People expected experts but all we got was party cadres who lacked knowledge or experience,” says Bimala Rai Paudyal a National Assembly member. “Considering such behaviour and practices, what distinguishes the House of Representatives from the National Assembly?”
A loser’s second chance 
Narayan Kaji Shrestha, who faced defeat in the 2017 general election from Gorkha-2, was elected as a member of the National Assembly on January 23, 2020. Elected from Gandaki Province, Shrestha currently is the Deputy Prime Minister and Home Minister of the country.
Bhagwati Neupane who lost the election from Gandaki province and Bimala Ghimire who lost the election for mayorship in Bhanu Municipality also shared the same trajectory.
Similarly, Mrigendra Kumar Singh Yadav and Jag Prasad Sharma were defeated in the House of Representatives elections, from Saptari-4 and Dang-3 respectively are now members of the National Assembly. Bam Dev Gautam, who lost the elections from Bardiya, secured a place in the upper house through nomination by President Bidya Devi Bhandari.
Even those who did not win as ward member(s) got the opportunity to become members of the National Assembly including Sindh Bahadur Bishwakarma who was appointed on February 7, 2018. He is soon leaving his post on March 3.
Despite the repeated criticisms, the political parties have not paid attention to this concern posed by political leaders and the general public. The latest proof of this is the list of candidates for the National Assembly elections scheduled on January 25. The list contains names like Krishna Prasad Sitaula, defeated in the House of Representatives elections in 2022 from Koshi Province, and Pooja Chaudhary, who lost in the provincial assembly elections 2022 from Rautahat-3 (a).
Speaker Ganesh Prasad Timilsina, who led the National Assembly for the entire six years under the federal system, is also dissatisfied with the individuals who have made it to the upper house. 
“The allegations are something for the parties to ponder upon. The leaders should have prioritised involving intellectuals/neutrals rather than managing its members,” he says.
The 59-member National Assembly elects eight representatives, equally from all seven provinces, with an additional three individuals nominated by the President. The Constitution ensures representation of women, Dalits, minorities or disabled communities, envisioning that experts, experienced individuals, and the most qualified people from various fields will become members of the National Assembly.
Easy way in
File: A National Assembly meeting
There are some reasons why leaders aspire to join the upper house, and even the leadership create opportunities for them. 
In National Assembly elections, voters consist of local-level heads/deputy heads and provincial assembly members. Typically, individuals seeking these positions undergo a vetting process by their respective parties. As a result, aspiring members of parliament can focus less on persuading individual voters and more on gaining party support to secure their candidacy. 
Moreover, being a member of the National Assembly opens avenues to ministerial roles. The constitution prohibits a National Assembly member from becoming the Prime Minister, but not Deputy Prime Minister. Due to such opportunities, leaders are enticed to seek a position in the assembly.
The National Assembly is currently in its fourth election cycle since the promulgation of the Consitution in 2015. Scheduled for January 25, this election aims to fill 19 seats vacated by individuals completing their six-year terms. The previous election cycles took place in 2017, involving 56 members, followed by 2019 with 18 positions, and 2020 with 19 positions.
The cascading impacts
File: A National Assembly meeting
Another reason why the National Assembly is finding it difficult to justify itself is that it has become a shadow of the House of Representatives. The meeting of the National Assembly did not have one session when the House of Representatives was dissolved by then Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli twice. The demands and issues raised by the opposition parties in the House of Representatives automatically went to the National Assembly, where the parliamentarians of the ruling party put forward any proposal, they endorse it the same as in the House of Representatives.
The latest example – is the main opposition UML did not allow the meeting of the House of Representatives to continue for five days from July 5, 2023, due to a statement made by Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal during his visit to India. Consequently, the meeting of the National Assembly was also paused during that period.
The UML obstructed the House of Representatives for almost a month starting mid-July last year demanding a high-level inquiry committee to probe the 60-kilogram gold smuggling case and the resignation of the Home Minister. The National Assembly followed suit with leaders pushing their agendas forward.
Speaker Ganesh Timilsina himself is dissatisfied that every behaviour and activity of the House of Representatives influence the National Assembly. He says despite his attempts to prevent the overshadowing, it has been unfortunate that he did not garner the goodwill of the top leaders during political disputes.
Reinstating power
The National Assembly is a permanent institution. Therefore, it can remain operational even in the absence of the House of Representatives. Under normal circumstances, Speaker Timilsina initiated a positive practice by personally participating in different committees. Nevertheless, in the absence of the House of Representatives, the National Assembly often experienced inactivity.
In December 2020, the Prime Minister at that time, KP Sharma Oli, dissolved the House of Representatives. Subsequently, a session of the National Assembly was convened on January 1, 2021. Despite lasting only seven hours over four days, this session, which took place after the dissolution, failed to address crucial public issues. Even after six months, important matters remained unaddressed within the House.
On May 22, 2021, the UML-led government once again dissolved the House of Representatives. The meeting of the National Assembly and committees was affected once more. However, the dissolutions were declared unconstitutional by the Supreme Court, reinstating the parliament.
The Constitution says that despite the closing of the National Assembly session, thematic committee meetings can still take place. However, both the National Assembly and its committees remained inactive until the restoration of the House of Representatives.
According to Khimlal Devkota, a member of the National Assembly, when the House of Representatives was dissolved twice, it seemed that the National Assembly was also in a state of dissolution.
Bimala Rai Paudyal also believes that the inability to resume the upper house is a mark of weakness. 
“Since the government was not in a position to call, the President needed to be consulted by the chair together with the consultation committee. That was not done either,” she says.
Constitutional and legal distinctions

Except for the Constitution of Nepal (1962) and the Interim Constitution of Nepal (2007), all other constitutions in Nepal provided for a bicameral parliament with the National Assembly or the Upper House and the House of Representatives or the Lower House. The practices before 2015 were under the unitary governance system, but after the adoption of the federal democratic republican governance system, the role of the National Assembly has changed somewhat.
In the preamble of the constitution prepared by the ‘Constituent Assembly, and Administrative Organ Designation Committee’ during the drafting of the constitution, it is mentioned that some different qualifications have been prescribed for being a member of the House of Representatives and the National Assembly, with the intention that qualified people can be represented in the National Assembly.
Chair of the National Assembly Ganesh Prasad Timilsina restates that the members of the upper house should be assessed based on the country’s expectations with clear criteria. 
There is no definite definition of an expert in the constitution. It has been stated symbolically, “…It is expected that the members should have some basic skills to face the challenges and fulfil their responsibilities.”
According to the constitution, the responsibility of the National Assembly is to correctly establish the rights of the local level, state, and union, and to prevent the House of Representatives from trying to enact laws contrary to the spirit of federalism. There is an explanatory comment in the constitution about the propriety of the National Assembly – “This House is expected to fulfil its role to maintain creative and mutual relations between the national government and the provinces.”
In addition, there are some constitutional and legal differences regarding the National Assembly. But the MPs are demanding that it should cease. When a bill originating in the House of Representatives is passed and sent to the National Assembly, and if the latter does not decide within 60 days, it proceeds de facto.
This has placed the National Assembly in a dilemma. The Chairman of the National Assembly, Timilsina, says, “Such an arrangement should also apply to the House of Representatives, or both should be equal.”
Need for course correction 
PM Pushpa Kamal Dahal speaking in the National Assembly meeting.
Some instances have turned these so-called experts into a laughing stock due to their actions. 
On July 5, 2023,  a discussion on the Electronic Commerce (E-Commerce) Bill 2023 was tabled in the National Assembly. However, the parliamentarians misunderstood the main point and instead discussed the matter of electricity. The MPs, who had not read the proposal, suggested that electricity consumption within Nepal should also be increased besides exporting electricity to India and Bangladesh.
During the meeting, Ramesh Rijal, the Minister of Industry, Commerce and Supplies, also mentioned that India would purchase electricity during the Prime Minister’s visit. Unfortunately, the bill was unanimously approved.
Timilsina considers the incident an example, that in his six-year tenure, he does not want to remember. Som Bahadur Thapa, a former secretary at the Parliament Secretariat, termed the incident ‘a joke’ in the Parliament of Nepal. 
“This is strong proof of the kind of MPs we have, who speak without knowing what they are talking about.” 
Timilsina assumed the role of the speaker/chair of the National Assembly after the establishment of the Federal Democratic Republic. He had the opportunity to establish the system and the dignity of the National Assembly. However, instead of setting a positive example, he will soon be retiring after being accused of playing tricks with the Speaker and showing interest in the work of the House of Representatives.
Timilsina has repeatedly commented on the affairs of the House of Representatives. The latest instance was during a seminar on ‘Japan: Past, Present, and Future’ held in the capital on December 2, 2023, he publicly stated that the election results of the House of Representatives did not bode well.
Pointing to the emergence of a new party and the victory of some independent candidates, he said, “In a democracy, you get to choose candidates, irrespective of their party affiliation. However, is the signal positive?”
In August/ September 2022, Timilsina wrote a letter to the Election Commission, urging them to extend the tenure of Speaker and Deputy Speaker. Upon receiving a response stating that the Commission would not determine the tenure of the elected Parliament, Timilsina directed the Parliament Secretariat not to execute decisions made by the Management Committee after September 17, 2022.
This created conflict between the Speaker of the House of Representatives and the Speaker of the National Assembly and in the crux of this dispute between the parties, the country had to bear the consequences of this conflict. Laws could not be enacted promptly, and the place once considered the domain of experts was overshadowed by the party’s interest. 
A study conducted by the Democracy Resource Center Nepal (DRCN) on the legislative functioning of the National Assembly has revealed that the Upper House has passed some bills that go against the spirit of federalism.
The report’s concluding remarks say, “…the bills passed by the House of Representatives have not undergone significant changes or discussions in the National Assembly. The conclusion section of the study states that – “Furthermore, some bills, contradicting the spirit of federalism and addressing the interests of interest groups, have been approved by the National Assembly.”
Overall, in the last six years, parties have introduced individuals who, given their presentation level, have raised questions about the National Assembly’s justification. If there are no changes in the constitution, laws, and policies concerning the upper assembly, these concerns will persist.”"

Role of entrepreneurship education in Nepal’s quest for economic empowerment

While most of the nation was preparing for the festival of lights, Tihar in early November 2023, something no less exciting was fuelling our sparks from oceans away. A queer art festival was happening for the seventeenth year and we had a chance to attend it as delegates. Our delegation was made possible through the collaboration between the Outburst Arts, an art organisation based in Northern Ireland, UK and the British Council, Nepal.
There is a clear distinction between cities in terms of their flourishing arts scenes, and this became apparent during a visit to Belfast, Northern Ireland, specifically for the Outburst Queer Arts Festival held in the charming city centre. The organisation of such a festival requires months of careful preparation and planning.
The queer art festival started as short events lasting a few days. Now, after 17 years, it has grown into a ten-day festival with panel discussions, theatre performances, and exhibitions. Program guides were available at venues, partner hotels, local libraries, and shops. Many delegates, including us, came from outside Northern Ireland to attend.
During the queer art festival, we had the opportunity to connect with art curators, publishers, artists, and representatives from other British Council departments around the world (Lithuania, France, South Africa, Turkey, Greece, Jordan, England, and Argentina to name a few.) 
Each event that we attended gave us a different insight into what the arts can do and how it can facilitate connections. We gained insights from queer publishers and art curators on the challenges they face in their own countries due to resources and sometimes from bureaucracy in systems. We also got to see the way people can thrive when given a platform to showcase their works, such as an art exhibition in which the artist reimagined intimacy for queer people.
On the other hand, Nepal struggles by and large at times for queer visibility. There are no explicit spaces for SOGIESC (Sexual Orientation, Gender Identity and Expressions and Sex Characteristics) artists to showcase their works nor openly come together as a community, it all exists in pocket spaces. In the same way, something that struck us was the presence of older queer artists at the festival. 
It was not just for one particular event during the queer art festival. We noticed an active participation and involvement of older queer people throughout the festival there. It was fascinating to see queer artists in their 40s and 50s share their transformative and inspiring work. Whereas, back home, the queer folks at the forefront of queer art, advocacy and activism are mostly Gen-Zs and millennials. We have very few queer elders that we can count on our fingers who are diligently working for Nepali queer folks. Even among them, some still hold onto archaic notions and refuse to evolve and embrace changes. So, there’s that.
From dream to reality

Before being selected as delegates, both of us joined online meetings with British Council Nepal and the Outburst representatives facilitated through Kaalo 101 (an art space in Patan), along with interested queer artists from Nepal. We had a total of three meetings where we discussed the possibilities and challenges of doing a queer art festival in Nepal. 
The discourse also entailed us sharing a presentation about the updates of the queer art scene in Nepal in the last five years. The updates included memorable leaps taken in queer arts from music to literature and fashion and more by artists from diverse walks of life. Days after the third meeting, the British Council extended invitations to us to attend the Outburst Queer Arts Festival.
Our delegation is just one example of the transcontinental collaboration because it was something that happened for the first time and involved us. But, Outburst Arts and the British Council have been practising cross-continental collaboration for years. Even in this year’s festival, we witnessed a lot of artists from different continents work together in exhibitions, lectures, panel discussions, magazines and so on. The amalgamation introduced us to brilliant thought-provoking work that defies gender and sociopolitical norms. The power of transcontinental collaboration was beyond beautiful.
Imagining queer arts in Nepal

The queer art scene in Nepal is an emerging one. While a full-fledged festival may not be possible now, something small yet significant is achievable. Time and again, different organisations have been running large art exhibitions/tours for weeks and months. However, in the microcosm that is Nepal, especially Kathmandu, the capital is no stranger to art-oriented programs. What it has been unfamiliar with precisely is queer art. And the unfamiliarity is not something induced by the lack of queer artists and their art. Sadly, it is because of inadequate platforms, space and resources to pursue queer arts.
Despite this, through the years there have been events and literature that have emerged centring on queer identity, but it has not come without its challenges. On collections of stories, “Pride Climbing Higher” and “Songs of Revolution” showcase stories from Nepalis across Nepal. There are not many stories reflecting the Nepali queer experiences otherwise. 
June Pride Parade by Queer Youth Group has gained momentum as well in the past few years since its conception, from a small gathering to now a large parade with performances from community members. The same can be said about Blue Diamond Society’s (BDS) Rainbow Visibility Pride events in August during the festival of Saa-Paru (Gai Jatra) which has been running for well over a decade; in recent years they have included flash mobs and interaction programmes as well in lead up to their parade. Individuals within the community have also organised their queer gatherings with friends, thus coming back to the cosmos of pocket spaces in celebrating queerness.
While artists like us are creative with what we want to put out, we still need organisations like the British Council to foster spaces and connections to enable us to do that. Then and again, artists have come together and collaborated on queer-centric projects. But, we need funding and resources to achieve bigger-scale projects that unite more artists and transcend borders.
Both of us advocate for queer rights and are involved in programs and activities that push the narrative further, extend the visibility of the community and normalise conversations surrounding queerness. Among other things, we are also the founders of Queering The Bond, a networking collective for Nepali queer folks and Shuby is also the founder of Queer Honky-Tonk, a platform to promote queer performances and networking with events such as a drag show or open mic every few months. However, both of us, individually or collaboratively can only do so much. 

The challenges of living in a capitalistic world oftentimes outweigh the passion we have for the queer art scene in Nepal. And this is where we expect the government and organisations to step up with policies, platforms and programs to provide spaces, opportunities and resources for queer artists. Here, the British Council joined hands with Outburst Arts, which paved the way for our delegation. We would not have known about the marvellous queer art festival at the other end of the world otherwise.
Besides the limitations brought by insufficient spaces and social unawareness, the centralised capital does hinder queer artists from outside the city to connect, create and collaborate. Art already is centralised and elitist. On top of that, the concentrated Kathmandu Valley is of no help when it comes to making art accessible beyond its borders.
Furthermore, there is also the expectation from basically everyone to have the perfect festival that caters to all people’s needs and wants. While the festival, if it should happen, is bound to be done with the right intentions, there is a lot of pressure for the first-time event itself. The festival will be inclusive and diverse. But, realistically speaking, it would be a struggle to make it relevant to each queer person from east to west.
Speaking of struggles, a visceral feeling of uneasiness swarmed over me with each step I took while exiting the airport after the flight back home. I, Birat, personally felt that I could not be as free or unrestrained in Nepal as I was during my time in Belfast. No wonder a lot of the queer people we know opt for abroad.
Seventeen years ago, when the Outburst Queer Arts Festival first began, it certainly was not as celebrated or large as it is now. What we are trying to convey here is that we do not have to start big. We can aim for something small yet promising. While there might be expectations to check all the boxes, it is crucial to be mindful of our capacity as well. But, we can be capacitated and this is where you – people in power, art enthusiasts, grant and resource allocators and media come in. It is time we all believe in Nepali queer art and create space for it to not only survive but thrive. It is imperative to understand that formulating our imagination into reality can only be possible through unwavering collaboration."

National Assembly election taking place today 
","The month of January saw major road accidents in different parts of the country, including Lamhi in Dang, Dhorpatan in Baglung, and Chandragiri in Kathmandu. Road accidents have been common throughout the country with Nepal Police data suggesting over 2,500 people dying in them annually. Despite this, the Ministry of Finance has shown reluctance to introduce the proposed Road Safety Bill to reduce traffic accidents, fatalities, and serious injuries, and enhance road safety. 
Instead, the Finance Ministry has asked the Ministry of Physical Infrastructure and Transport to include the proposed bill in the Public Roads Act. Along with that, the government’s initiative to pass dedicated laws on road safety and set up a mechanism, including the empowered National Road Safety Council (NRSC), to decrease accidents, has come to a halt.
Keshav Kumar Sharma, secretary of the Ministry of Physical Infrastructure and Transport, says they asked for a dedicated road safety law that comprehensively addresses institutional arrangements was the need of the hour. This includes ensuring safety in road construction, promoting public awareness, providing training and communication facilities, implementing rescue mechanisms, and arranging rehabilitation for families affected by road accidents. However, the Ministry of Finance believes a separate law is unnecessary due to concerns about potential increased financial burden.
Hourly need

Officials from the Ministry of Physical Infrastructure allege that the Ministry of Finance is approaching sensitive matters, such as passenger safety, solely from an economic standpoint. They say that concerns related to road, vehicle, and passenger safety are being overshadowed, and there are indications that this approach will continue. 
“The government is avoiding addressing the sensitive issue of road accidents and the associated human and material costs, fearing an increase in expenses. This contradicts the government’s commitment and policy to reduce traffic accidents in the future,” says an official from the Ministry of Physical Infrastructure on the condition of anonymity.
According to the Ministry of Physical Infrastructure, the existing laws lack the vision and purpose necessary for developing a sustainable, safe, risk-free, and reliable transportation operation and security system. Therefore, the Ministry of Physical Infrastructure officials argue that a distinct law is essential to decrease road accidents and ensure the safety of pedestrians, including passenger transport workers and roadside residents, as well as pets, wild animals, and birds. 
“The Road Safety Act is the need of the hour as it will help us during post-accident rescue, treatment management, rehabilitation, and legal representation,” says the official.
Currently, there are gaps in enforcing road rules, monitoring vehicle capacities, ensuring road structure safety, managing traffic signs, and organizing road safety facilities. The implementation of the Road Safety Act is seen as crucial to address these issues.
However, there has not been a facilitative environment for providing education and raising awareness about road traffic safety, safety mechanisms, and coordinating among organisations related to road transport. The aspect of training drivers with skills and knowledge, as well as monitoring road safety on the roads, is also lacking. This is why experts have been suggesting introducing a separate road safety law to address these aspects.
The Finance Ministry, however, says that road safety should not be downplayed by ignoring human sensibilities related to road safety and citing economic reasons. Officials from the Ministry of Physical Infrastructure argue that incorporating safety considerations in the Road Act does not automatically result in a decrease in accidents or the integration of post-accident rescue, relief, and rehabilitation efforts.
“The existing laws do not address road safety anywhere. Due to its lack of clarity and inadequacy, it has not been implemented with due diligence. For instance, provisions such as those for vehicle inspectors outlined in the Transport Act have not been acted upon by the government,” says an official from the Transport Ministry.
Policies and commitments, but no laws

The Motor Vehicles and Transport Management Act (1993) includes several provisions related to vehicle registration, road permits, driver’s licenses, traffic management, insurance, and penalties. The Public Roads Act (1974) primarily focuses on road management. However, there is no provision in the Act regarding the National Road Safety Council.
In this situation, Nepal has developed a 10-year road safety action plan but is yet to enact corresponding legislation. Unfortunately, government agencies and mechanisms are not obligated to follow the action plan, as it lacks legal guidance.
Now, the Transport Ministry holds the view that if safety considerations are explicitly addressed in the Public Roads Act, the outcome will not differ from what the Finance Ministry has said. Given the Public Roads Act’s close association with the Department of Road, the ministry thinks greater emphasis will be placed on road construction. However, they argue that incorporating the road safety aspect into the Act would not be effective.
Secretary Sharma of the Transport Ministry is tasked with ensuring road safety, overseeing physical infrastructure and transport, and coordinating efforts across education, health, home, law, federal affairs, and general administration ministries. This responsibility extends to provincial ministries, local levels, as well as various agencies, organisations, security agencies, non-governmental organisations, and related entities, each with their specific roles.
“As all the agencies need to be allocated responsibilities for various aspects of road safety, we have requested them to collaborate in formulating a distinct law. This should encompass the reduction of all types of accidents,” said Sharma.
The ministry believes that a dedicated law addressing road safety is crucial to mitigate severe road accidents in Nepal and to uphold the commitments made by the country on the international stage.
Nepal has committed to implementing the Stockholm Declaration through the Global Road Traffic Safety Conference in 2020, as per the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. Nepal, which has incorporated sustainable development goals into its national development plan, has not yet commenced work aligned with these objectives.

Nevertheless, Nepal’s neighbouring countries are already addressing road safety through legal frameworks. Various states in India have enacted road safety laws, and the effectiveness of these laws is contributing to a 50 per cent reduction in road accidents.
In 1999, Bhutan also introduced a unified road safety and transport act. Pakistan, on the other hand, issued the National Highway Safety Ordinance-2000 to ensure road safety, distinct from its National Highway Authority Act (1991). Britain, Australia, America, New Zealand, and other countries have established separate road safety laws as well.
Road safety neglected
In Nepal, road safety has been consistently neglected due to the absence of dedicated legislation. Road safety expert Keshav Adhikari says that the government primarily focused on road construction, overlooks crucial aspects such as road safety and reinforcement. Consequently, roads are transforming into perilous pathways for both vehicles and passengers.
“There is a lack of interest in formulating policies and laws aimed at mitigating financial losses resulting from accidents,” says Adhikari.
He further points out that safety is not a governmental priority, as expanding the road network is perceived to yield more political benefits than implementing additional structures to enhance road safety.
“When I worked as an expert in the Transport Ministry for over a year, I realised that promoting road safety is not a government priority,” he says. “Annually, more people die due to road accidents than those who die in natural disasters, but the government has not given it much attention.”
Even though the prime minister, ministers, and MPs keep asserting that roads have been constructed, no one seems to be addressing the critical issues of road safety and quality.
Saroj Sitaula, General Secretary of the Federation of Nepalese National Transport Entrepreneurs (FNNTE), says that the government must be attentive as accidents are on the rise due to various technical and human factors, including road infrastructure. 
“Many accidents can be mitigated by improving road conditions, installing barriers on the sides, putting up informational boards, and ensuring scientific and practical road markings,” he says. “We need to formulate a plan and progress accordingly.”
Sitaula argues that the government should establish policies to create mechanisms for emergency rescue, treatment, and rehabilitation after an accident occurs. He emphasises the importance of enhancing road infrastructure, conducting a scientific examination of the technical condition of vehicles, and ensuring compliance with the law by drivers, passengers, and regulators. He says that blaming drivers and transport entrepreneurs for accidents is inadequate, and the government must fulfil its responsibilities.
Roads are unsafe

Nepal currently boasts a road network spanning approximately 100,000 km, with the majority consisting of dirt and gravel roads. Among the more than 22,000 kilometres of national and subsidiary highways, numerous sections remain unpaved.
Despite the government’s substantial investment in road construction and expansion, minimal efforts are allocated to ensuring road safety. 
Recently, all three levels of government have accelerated the widening of roads, incorporating asphalt and slopes. However, it appears that issues concerning road quality and safety are escalating at a faster pace. Roads that have been neglected in the guise of maintenance have become a nightmare for the public.
Infrastructure expert Suryaraj Acharya notes that these problems arise due to the tendency to construct roads only after they have sustained damage, without considering potential issues during the initial construction phase."

Realme has launched its popular mid-range number series smartphone, the Realme 12 Pro series. The series includes the Realme 12 Pro 5G and the Realme 12 Pro+ 5G which are the successors of the Realme 11 Pro+ 5G and Realme 11 Pro 5G respectively. The Realme 11 series was widely appreciated for its design and performance at the price range. 
The 12 series has stepped up the game with an even better design. Realme has not only changed the design but has also upgraded the performance and the camera to compete in the mid-range price market. Realme recently has been focusing a lot on the design aspect and the price range performance. 
The 12 Pro+ has some major differences from last year’s 11 Pro+ which include design, IP rating, chipset, camera and charging. 
Let us see what the luxuriously designed smartphone delivers in terms of specs.

Design and Display
The Realme 12 Pro+ and the Realme 12 Pro share the same design and dimensions. The design is fascinating. Realme patterned up with Luxury Swiss Watch designer Ollivier Savéo to craftfully design the smartphone. 
All the colour options have a vegan leather back. Since the phone is designed by a luxury watch designer, it comes with a big round camera module housing the triple camera setup. There is a golden 3D Jubilee Bracelet which gives the texture of a luxury watch strap. A golden patterned line runs through the middle and around the camera module for an even better look.

Regenerative Braking in EVs: Advantages, Disadvantages and Common Misconceptions 
","Ram Bujhaun Yadav with his land ownership certificate stands near a border pillar which he says was erroneously placed on his land. 
In October 2023, when 51-year-old Ram Bujhaun Yadav of Musaharnia Rural Municipality-5, Mukhiyapatti, Dhanusha, was at a relative’s house, someone told him that two Indian Sashastra Seema Bal (SSB) personnel were looking for him.
Anxious, he rushed home wondering why they were looking for him.
“They asked me if the paddy field in the no man’s land was mine. I told them yes and they asked me to cut down the paddy immediately,” he said.
The paddy was not ripe and Yadav asked them for some time. However, the SSB personnel told him he had to cut down his paddy immediately.
Ram Bujhaun and his wife Tetari Devi each own a 677-square-metre plot of land. As Nepal and India reevaluated the border, Ram Bujhan’s land was been deemed to be near the no man’s land as it now has two demarcation pillars.
Frustrated, Ram Bujhaun cut the paddy before it was due to be harvested. Now, he has been asked to not plant anything on the land as it falls in the no man’s land.
“Our border police don’t say a word. I can’t fight the SSB on my own,” says Ram Bujhaun adding he had decided not to plan anything on the land anymore.
Woes of the farmers
Many farmers in southern Nepal say their land has now been placed in India after the recent demarcation. 
When the Jamuna River, which flows through the no man’s land between Nepal and India, changed its course some two decades ago, some border pillars went missing. Locals say these pillars have now been placed encroaching on Nepali land.
In 2018, with the then Chief District Officer of Dhanusha, Pradeep Raj Kandel, and an official from Madhubani district, Bihar, India, a team that included border security forces from both countries, the Armed Police Force of Nepal, and SSB of India began placing border pillars after land measurement by technicians.
Locals have raised concerns, stating that border pillars have been positioned, encroaching approximately 50 to 100 meters of land into Nepal compared to the previous position. Many like Ram Bujhaun are unaware of when these border pillars were placed.
“I did not know that pillar was placed here. After I found out when I asked the village leaders, many said they were placing the border pillars as they pleased,” said Ram Bujhaun.
He was told to carry on planting paddy and that it would not matter as these issues had happened in the past. 
“They encroached on my land and have asked me not to plant anything. This is gross injustice,” he says.
Ram Bujhaun’s family owns a total of 4,000 square metres of land, with 2,000 square metres belonging to him and the remaining 2,000 square metres to his brother Bechan. However, 1,000 square metres of his land is now located on the Indian side after the demarcation. Despite this, he has been farming on the land and continues to pay taxes to the Department of Land Management and Archive in Nepal.
“They have marked my land to be on the Indian side and placed border pillars on it. I’ve been farming till now but I don’t know when they will ask me to stop,” he says.
Ignorance of the government
The Madhesh province in southern Nepal
The former ward chair of Mukhiyapatti Musharniya Rural Municipality-5, Ram Naresh Yadav, said that over time, India has encroached on numerous Nepali lands in various locations in the Madhesh Province. This, he says, happened due to the Nepali administration’s ignorance and weak stature.
“They (Nepali administration) were careless and that meant the Indian side placed these border pillars by encroaching on Nepali land,” says Ram Naresh.
He said that over 40 farmers from wards 1, 5, and 6 have land ranging from 300 to 1,600 square metres on the Indian side. 
“These farmers have land ownership certificates, but they cannot farm as the SSB says the land is in India and not Nepal,” said Ram Naresh.
In 1996, land ownership certificates were distributed after surveying the land in the border area. Local Dharmendra Kumar Yadav said that since then, the locals have been paying their land tax regularly. In 2018, when the pillar was being placed, the locals protested when they saw their land was being encroached on. However, since the demarcation had been agreed upon by high-ranking government officials of Nepal and India, the farmer’s voices went unheard.
“We tried to stop when the border pillars were being placed on our land. But the administrators from both sides forcibly put it there without even trying to hold a discussion,” said Harish Chandra Yadav. 
The Chief District Officer of Dhanusha, Chakrapani Pandey, says that the border pillars were placed by the technical team after the measurements and with the agreement of the high-ranking officials of the two countries.
“The fields and houses that are built in no man’s land have recently been cleared. No one can do anything in this particular area,” said Pandey. “We understand the people’s concern but we cannot do anything about it now.”"

Life is filled with surprises and unexpected events and it can change at any moment. The only thing certain in life is the uncertainty. Change is a natural and inevitable part of our lives, and it may be positive as well as negative.
Even though it is not guaranteed that we will wake up in the morning, we set the alarm every night with the hope that we will wake up in the morning. We do not know what each day is going to bring us, but we may have varieties, adventures, and endless opportunities.
The push to explore
The uncertainty sometimes forces us to explore those aspects of life, we never knew existed or needed. It also tests the mental strength of people and how they deal with it. The uncertainty has taught me to be grateful, as we never know what life throws at us.
In life, everything does not go according to our plans, and if we do not embrace the change we will face huge trouble. The Covid-19 pandemic is the best example of uncertainty, we were constantly fearing death and it was uncertain that we would see the sunrise the next day.
It is not certain that every decision in life will be correct, but if you fear not trying at all, you miss endless opportunities for learning and growing. When our decisions or outcomes are on the negative side, we get depressed and we might tend to think about committing suicide, but we forget that if we have life we have endless opportunities. 
Most of us plan for our careers, our love life, etc. and when those plans do not work out we start getting uncomfortable. But if we can deal with today, we can surely deal with tomorrow. We need to cherish little moments in our lives and know that nothing is permanent not even the failures and setbacks.
We come here with nothing and leave with nothing. So why should we hold the egos and grudges against each other? Instead of making our life meaningful and enjoying the journey of life, we get into puzzles of accumulating wealth and we go against our own loved ones for it. 
Change is certain

Nothing is permanent in life, everything can change in fractions of seconds. In today’s society, everyone is so busy, that we people have so less time for our loved ones. What I have learned over the years, is to find time in our busy schedule for our family because we never know when it will be our last day together with them. 
Yes! Death is a natural process, so if you have to die someday, why should you die with grudges in your heart? But instead of worrying about the inevitable, focusing on the things you can control will bring a lot of happiness in life.
Uncertainty is not only a negative thing; it also brings a lot of opportunity because you dare to change. The life-changing experience will not come knocking down your door, you need to expose yourself. We learn by doing and experimenting, even though we might fail. But that is not the end of the world. I still remember hesitating while applying for the role of leadership, at my school level as it was not certain that I would be chosen.
Even after being selected, I was uncertain about whether I could fulfil my responsibilities or not. But that uncertainty helped me grow out of my comfort zone and give my best input. If I had not applied for that role just because I was uncertain of the outcome, I would miss the biggest learning opportunity in my school life. So, do not let the uncertainty or the unknown ever stop you from trying and no matter how much we try, to plan life always finds a way to surprise us. 
It is important to stay grounded when we have everything we wish for because life can take such a turn that we had never expected in our wildest dreams. Similarly, nothing is permanent in life, the financial hardships, the grades, the breakups, etc. But the most important thing is not to lose hope during those difficult times.
According to the data provided by Nepal police, around 6,830 people took their lives in the fiscal year 2022/23. There is nothing in life that cannot be resolved although it may take time, committing suicide should not be an option. It’s important to share feelings among family members or loved ones because together as a family any problem can be overcome.
Embrace the unknown and focus on enhancing your life, instead of worrying about what will happen next. Always find time for your loved ones, as life is uncertain. We should be grateful that we are alive and accept that change is the only constant thing in life. Do not let the unknown, stop you from trying or achieving your goals and always remember that even if you fail, you still have endless opportunities."

Queer art festival: Reflecting and imagining the power of collaboration in Nepal 
","Growing up in Bajhang, Rabindra Dhant had big dreams. He longed for recognition, a burning desire to etch his name in the history books. Fate, however, had a different path for him.
In school, Dhant’s passion lay in volleyball, and he aspired to be the pride of his village on the court. His goal was to rise high and deliver powerful shots that would echo his name far and wide in the village. But that never happened because of his height.
At the age of 16, he realised that he needed to leave Bajhang in pursuit of a brighter future, just as his father and brother had done before him. It was there that he ventured into the world of karate, eventually transitioning into mixed martial arts (MMA). This decision, as fate would have it, would transform his life entirely.
On September 15, Rabindra Dhant made history as Nepal’s first fighter in the esteemed One Championship. Going head-to-head against the seasoned Russian fighter, Torepchi Dongak, the 24-year-old secured his place in Nepal’s history book by effortlessly besting his opponent in the third round. Just days after, he was welcomed by hundreds of enthusiastic supporters as he touched down in Kathmandu from Thailand, a touching manifestation of a once cherished dream.
“I could not believe that was all for me,” Dhant tells Onlinekhabar. “In my childhood, I had yearned for recognition from my village. And now, here I stood at the airport, the entire country embracing me like a hero.”
That has filled a fire in his belly. After five gruelling years of blood, sweat and tears, Rabindra Dhant has finally earned his place in an international fight. Yet, he perceives this achievement as merely the beginning. He is firm in his resolve not to let the love and fame he has garnered overshadow his dedication. He recognises the need to persevere, to work even harder, in order to compete on the grandest stage the world has to offer.
“I owe that to myself and to the people who have stood by me when I was alone,” he says.
Fighting for passion


Listen to what Rabindra Dhant has to say about his One Championship fight and his MMA journey.
Rabindra Dhant grew up in Bitthadchir rural municipality in Bajhang. After completing his grade 10, he left for Pithoragarh in Uttarakhand, India. That was, and still, is what a lot of young boys who grow up in Sudarpaschim Province in Nepal do. 
During his mid-teens, he took up physical labour. Alongside his friends from the village, he toiled, moving rocks and even an electricity pole, all in pursuit of earning enough for two meals a day. His father, having endured the hardships of such labour, longed for a brighter future for him. He encouraged Dhant to venture to New Delhi in search of better employment opportunities.
“He told me to find a technical job,” says Dhant.
In Delhi, he secured a job as an office boy, spending his days tidying up the workspace and preparing tea for those who worked there. Witnessing young boys and girls of his age coming in to study, striving to build a future for themselves, served as a stark realisation that being confined to the role of an office boy was not the life he aspired for.
Karate became his refuge. He dedicated his mornings to rigorous training, while his afternoons were devoted to office chores. His progress caught the eye of his coaches, who recommended that he explore the realm of MMA.
“I had no idea what MMA was. But I was told that I had great stamina and that would help me so I decided to try my hand at it,” he says.

His venture remained a well-guarded secret within his family. Knowing he would not receive their approval, he decided not to tell anyone.
However, matters grew more complex when he found himself in need of funds to participate in an amateur fight night. He mustered the courage to tell his uncles about his involvement in MMA classes. He explained his desire to compete in a fight. His uncles were not happy, but they agreed to give him money asking him to give up his MMA pursuit thereafter.
Having emerged victorious in the competition, he held onto the hope that it would finally silence his critics. But to his dismay, he continued to face relentless pressure to abandon his pursuit.
“No one in my village was into sports. I was the first sportsperson from the village,” he says. “This is why I did not get the support. Every time my parents called, they would ask how much money I would make. That was discouraging.”
By this point, he was captivated by the sport. After making a strong impression on his coaches, he was offered the opportunity to become a trainer at the local gym. He shared this news with his parents, but once again, he was met with the discouraging response that he would not be earning any money by becoming a fighter.
Money held little sway over Rabindra Dhant at the time. He was passionate about MMA and was doing whatever in his power to ensure he made it. This dedication pushed him to win a national-level amateur competition in India. Winning that made him eligible to take part in the world championship.
In order to get here, he would have to relinquish his Nepali citizenship and adopt an Indian one. However, the prospect of hoisting the Indian flag was a step he was not yet ready to take. Instead, he chose to return to Nepal, determined to explore any possible avenues for participation.
“Nepal did not have an association which meant my world championship dream was shattered.”
Disappointed, he returned to Delhi and took part in various professional fights. While these bouts seldom brought in money, they instilled in him a fighting spirit that would eliminate fear from his system in the long run.
Finding mentor

The Covid pandemic compelled him, like many other Nepalis working in India, to return home. After the lockdown lifted, he returned to India, only to find it increasingly challenging to secure fights. Frustration mounting, he eventually made the decision to come back to Nepal, seriously considering leaving Nepal for foreign employment.
“I wanted to go to countries where I could fight. But I could not find a place where I could do that. All employment agencies told me the same thing I could not continue MMA if I left for foreign employment.”
That is when he met jiu-jitsu coach Diwiz Piya Lama. Around 2021, jiu-jitsu was one of the few forms of MMA that was being taught in Nepal. After engaging in sparring sessions with each other, Lama recognised Dhant’s potential and decided to mentor him.
“That was my turning point. Diwiz dai has been an important figure in my life. Without him, I would probably be working abroad,” he says.
A strong sense of brotherhood and mutual respect defines the relationship between them. Their connection is tangible; Lama beams with pride at Dhant’s achievements, while Dhant looks up to Lama with sincere fondness and profound respect. In the span of the last two years, their camaraderie has solidified, woven through unwavering day and night training sessions, all in pursuit of their collective dream to take Nepali MMA to new heights.
Fighting out of Nepal, Rabindra Dhant ventured to Bangalore, Madhya Pradesh, and Goa for fights. With each victory, his confidence grew, reinforcing his belief that he was on the path to success. However, the persistent pressure from his family back home always loomed in the back of his mind, casting a shadow over his aspirations.
“The talk about me not earning money and supporting my family was always something that kept me awake at night. Despite all that, I was winning. Sometimes I wonder what would have happened if I was not winning.”
Bajhang to Bangkok


YouTube sensation Sisan Baniya is making a documentary on Rabindra Dhant.
Lama believing in him, however, gave him added confidence. Lama, in various podcasts, has been stating how strong Rabindra Dhant is and how fearless he is. Eager to showcase Dhant’s talent in Nepal, Lama embarked on a project: the Nepal Warrior Championship.
Lama wanted Nepali fighters to get more exposure which would then catch the eye of sports promotions abroad. Rabindra Dhant was the main event of the show as he took on India’s Jason Lyngdoh. Dhant won comfortably and that gave Lama the belief he was ready for the big stage and asked him to come to Thailand with him.
“I had no money but he insisted I go and there I was training at Fairtex with some great fighters.”
As Dhant was training, Lama was working behind the scenes to fix a fight for him. They had been to the Lumpinee Stadium in Bangkok and were manifesting fighting there. Soon their hard work paid off. Dhant got the fight he wanted. He was all set to take on the Russian fighter with around 300 amateur fights to his name, Torepchi Dongak.
Over the next month, he dedicated himself to training with an intensity he had never before experienced. Under the guidance of different coaches, he reflects that he gained more in that short span than he had in the five years prior.
It was a gruelling journey. He had to shed eight kilograms and forgo the foods he enjoyed. Enduring four to five hours of rigorous training each day in the sweltering, humid air of Thailand, the challenges were undeniable. Yet, he carried the awareness that many had toiled tirelessly to pave the way for him. He, too, had put in relentless effort to reach this point.
Fight night

Stepping into the ring, Rabindra Dhant exuded a determined focus. The pressure was undeniable, yet he held onto the belief that triumph would unlock a world of possibilities for him.
“I keep telling myself if I won, everything I wish for would come true. If I did not win, all my dreams were over,” he says.
As Round 1 commenced, he was prepared for what lay ahead, and the unfolding events followed the anticipated course. While he believed he could hold his own against Dongak in striking, he soon recognised the necessity to alter his approach. He realised he could not keep up with the rapid pace of the kickboxer.
Adapting his strategy, Dhant opted for takedowns, gradually wearing Dongak down. The Russian fighter appeared fatigued, succumbing to the mounting pressure as Dhant secured rounds 1 and 2.
“Coaches told me to finish him.”
And finish him he did. In the third round, he executed a decisive takedown, relentlessly striking Dongak until the referee intervened, halting the match. At that moment, Rabindra Dhant stood victorious, leaving him momentarily lost for words in the wake of his monumental victory.
“I looked at the camera and said, Nepal had arrived in the international fighting scene.”
The day became etched in the memory of every MMA enthusiast in Nepal. The match was screened live in numerous locations across the country. Dhant’s name was being tagged in various social media posts, and as he connected to WiFi, his phone froze under the flood of congratulations pouring in from every corner of the land.
“It was so emotional. I had to take a moment to take it all in.”
Upon his return home on September 19, Rabindra Dhant was greeted with a grand welcome at the Tribhuvan International Airport.
“I always used to wonder what it would feel like to receive a hero’s welcome in my village. Yet, here I stood at the airport, surrounded by people, snapping pictures with me. I could not help but wonder what I had done to deserve all of this.”
He believes that his professional MMA career is just taking off. It is a stark change, considering the same parents who used to question him about when he would start earning money are now standing firmly behind him, offering their support.
“One Championship was my dream, but I never anticipated receiving so much love in my debut,” says Dhant. “My professional MMA journey has just begun, and I am fully aware that I will need to put in twice the effort to reach the next level.”"

Chitwan, September 15
The construction of Gautam Buddha International Cricket Stadium which was halted due to various reasons will resume soon.
The construction of the stadium came to a halt when the Dhurmus-Suntali Foundation, led by actors Sitaram Kattel and Kunjana Ghimire, withdrew their involvement, citing a lack of funds for the project.
The project will now be taken forward by Bharatpur metropolitan city as Mayor Renu Dahal has pledged to complete the project.
“It will be completed during my term as the mayor of Bhatartpur,” she said at an event held.
Dahal explained that a substantial loan is required to complete the stadium’s construction, and since there was no agreement in place for the government to cover the loan, she pointed out that progressing with the construction has become challenging.
Dahal said the construction would be carried out in phases.
In April, the government discussed taking over the responsibility to build the Bharatpur cricket stadium which has been left in limbo by the Dhurmus Suntali Foundation for the lack of funds.
Construction of the proposed Gautam Buddha International Cricket Stadium began on January 30, 2019. Nepalis at home and abroad as well as some expats chipped in their money, supporting the foundation financially. Everyone was hopeful that this would be Nepal’s most well-facilitated cricket stadium in a couple of years."

","The dispute at the All Nepal Football Association (ANFA) has now reached its peak.
Due to an insufficient quorum at the special general convention, 49 members, led by former ANFA president Karma Tsering Sherpa, called for the removal of President Pankaj Bikram Nembang and General Secretary Kiran Rai. They insisted on holding another special general convention within a 30-day period.
After Nembang declined to accept the proposal, the team presented it to senior vice president Bir Bahadur Khadka. With the majority of members calling for a special general convention and the removal of Nembang and Rai, the leadership of ANFA is now in a state of crisis.
Those requesting a special general convention mentioned that according to the ANFA statute, specifically Article 41(1) and Article 27(7), the ANFA Congress holds the authority to make decisions regarding the removal of the president and general secretary.
“The current leadership is incompetent. They have not done anything they promised and are wasting everyone’s time. We want them gone,” said Indraman Tuladhar, president of Sankata Club.
Tuladhar said the two being at ANFA would pose more risks to the football industry which has already suffered a lot since they took oath of office in June 2022.
Key issues at ANFA

As per Article 36 of ANFA’s statute, there exists a provision for convening a special general convention. If 40 per cent of the members submit a written request for such a convention, the working committee is bound to organise it within a 30-day timeframe. In the event that the working committee fails to initiate the special general convention, the members themselves hold the authority to call for it by issuing a 30-day notice.
Out of the 86 voters in the recent ANFA elections, 49 have submitted signed applications requesting the association of a special general convention within a 30-day period.
During this special convention, the primary agenda will involve the potential removal of President Nembang and General Secretary Rai. According to ANFA regulations, a minimum of 58 votes is needed to oust them from their respective positions.
General Secretary Rai, said that even though the application has been submitted, it has yet to be officially registered.
“Their application will be registered only after verification,” says Rai. “Once the application is  registered, the special general convention will be called within 30 days.”  
Rai also emphasises the importance of examining the legal procedures pertaining to the applications. As the signatures on the proposal are from different people and different clubs, ANFA will check them to for authenticity and proceed ahead.
The individuals endorsing a special general convention have levelled allegations against the current ANFA leadership. These allegations include breaches of statutes, an inability to prevent players from moving abroad, a lack of progress in initiating grassroots programs and academies, a failure to ratify the budget during the annual general meeting, and a perceived lack of transparency in financial transactions.
 “If the current leadership is at the helm, Nepali football will be finished,” reads the proposal.
The people calling for the removal of Nembang and Rai have said that even after more than a year in office, the two have consistently undertaken actions that have had a detrimental impact on the integrity of ANFA’s statutes.
Boycotting virtual meeting
File: All Nepal Football Association (ANFA)
What did not help was the leadership’s call to hold a virtual meeting instead of a physical one. ANFA dispatched a message to all its members, notifying them of the online annual general meeting (AGM) slated for September 10, specifically for the purpose of appointing auditors.
However, out of the 42 league clubs, 32 demanded the AGM be held physically, arguing conducting a virtual one contradicts ANFA’s statutes. The clubs cautioned they would boycott the AGM if their request was not accommodated. Nevertheless, the ANFA leadership did not heed this call. Consequently, the majority of members refrained from attending the AGM scheduled for September 10.
ANFA had no choice but to postpone the meeting to September 11. However, there was no chance the clubs would be present for an online meeting which meant the quorum was insufficient again.
Unsurprisingly there was a stalemate. Following that, ANFA spokesperson Suresh Shah released a statement, indicating that the meeting scheduled for Monday, September 11, has been postponed. Preceding this announcement, the opposition then submitted an application, urging the removal of Nembang and Rai from their respective positions.
What have you done?
File Photo: Pankaj Bikram Nembang electing Kiran Rai as ANFA’s general secretary.
ANFA members like the majority of the fans and football players are growing frustrated with Nembang. He barely held the Martyr’s Memorial ‘A’ Division League which was mired with issues. Unable to conduct the B Division and C Division has been another downside along with the inability to conduct the second round of the National Women’s League and the Lalit Memorial U19 competition. 
The inaugural U16 Youth League also experienced its share of controversy.
The leadership have been put under added pressure as national players started to leave the country citing lack of opportunity and future in football. It has not found a way to deal with this issue nor have they acknowledged it.
They have also faced accusations of handling tasks typically reserved for the annual general meeting (AGM) through the working committee.
Nembang assumed office as the president of ANFA on June 20, 2022. However, the first meeting of the new leadership’s working committee on June 22 was marred by controversy. The meeting’s legitimacy came into question, as appointments for the positions of general secretary, treasurer, and head of the foreign affairs department were made without a predefined agenda.
In a meeting lacking a specified agenda, Kiran Rai was named general secretary, Rabindra Joshi was appointed treasurer, and Nabin Padey was assigned as head of the foreign affairs department. The appointment of Padey sparked a significant dispute, resulting in him ultimately being designated as an advisor to ANFA’s president. Subsequently, Pandey chose to resign from the position.
On March 1, ANFA convened a meeting in the absence of a majority of its members and passed 20 resolutions. The opposition has yet to endorse these decisions. Among the decisions made was the appointment of a head coach and coordinators for various committees.
Previously, there had been a request to dismiss the general secretary and treasurer. However, the president chose not to include this demand in the agenda.
This has led to many people who were with Nembang during the election calling for his removal. Out of the 42 clubs, 32 want him gone. 
Anil Malla, Bhoj Raj Shahi, Rabin Chand, and Ramesh Byanjakar, who initially backed Nembang during the elections, have now aligned themselves with Karma Tsering Sherpa."

“As soon as the motion of no confidence is filed, the president should be suspended indefinitely,” said Tuladhar.

","Sadina Shrestha Photo: Shankar Giri 
Sadina Shrestha’s phone was ringing non-stop on August 30. As soon as the captain of the national women’s basketball team woke up, people were calling her asking her to watch a specific video which was going viral on social media. 
Watching the video shocked her. In the video, Bhim Singh Gurung, the acting president of the Nepal Basketball Association, made personal comments about Shrestha, critiquing not only her career but also her lifestyle, going so far as to comment on her attire.
“Whatever Sadina Shrestha is today it is just because of the Nepal Basketball Association,” Gurung said on the talk show. “From 0 to Z (top to bottom) she wears branded clothes. Sadina Shrestha is working as a sports teacher at St. Xavier School. I believe that is all due to the Nepal Basketball Association.”
He seems particularly unhappy with how Shrestha has been criticising the association.
“All she does is criticise it but never says a thing about what she has gained from it. Everyone here has been volunteering. Doesn’t she know that?” he said.
Gurung was adamant about how the association was helping the players. He stated how it had played an important role in helping these players get jobs and added how the scene has become better in the past decade.
The reality, however, is a far cry and the players know this.
When she watched the video, Shrestha was in shock. She did not know how to react. She was angry and frustrated. She knew she had to respond to the remarks made by Gurung and she did that by writing a 708-word long post on Facebook.
For a moment, Shrestha could not figure out how to react to the video, but later she took it to social media to vent her frustration and disappointment.
“I am in the wrong just because I asked the association to be more accountable and hold more games? Just because I asked a question the (acting) president can question how I dress. How is this right,” she wrote. 
Sadina Shrestha is deeply hurt and feels disrespected by this entire situation. Having devoted her life to basketball and its development, she deems all of this criticism as unnecessary. She expresses her dismay and states that she is still in shock over Gurung’s comments made on national television.
“This was unexpected and uncalled for,” she told Onlinekhabar. “I got this job at St. Xavier through hard work and my passion for developing the game. The association has not done anything to help players like me.”
Demanding accountability

Sadina Shrestha has been vocal about the criticising passive nature of the association for not organising adequate numbers of tournaments and providing essential facilities to players. She says this might be why Gurung, who has now become the acting president following the demise of Lama Tendi Sherpa in November 2021.
“We’ve been telling the association the same thing time and again. None of our concerns have been addressed. The game is stagnant and it has done nothing to change that. As the captain, it is my duty to question those in the leadership position and speak about these issues,” says Shrestha.
She is right. The national women’s basketball team, since the 2019 South Asian Games, has played one international tournament. What has irked Shrestha and players like her is how poor the domestic scene is too. Wanting to change that, she has been consistently demanding the association hold matches at the national level so the team is prepared when it has to play internationally.
“Is that too much to ask for?” she questions.
Sadina Shrestha has been part of the national women’s basketball team since 2011. Since then, she has been a constant in the team captaining it since then.
“After playing basketball for all these years, they do not see my contribution to the national team but the branded clothes that I wear,” says Shrestha.
She feels the statement from Gurung was disrespectful as it undermined what she has done in her career. Like many of her peers, she feels she could have left Nepal for a life abroad, but her love for basketball made her stay. Her passion even drove her to obtain an international coaching license, making her the sole woman basketball player in the country to achieve this feat.
“Unlike others, I care about basketball and its future,”  says Shrestha.
On her own

Shrestha is taken aback by the silence of the basketball players and coaches regarding the incident. She anticipated that they would openly offer their support to her, but things turned out differently.
The men’s team captain, Sadish Pradhan did make a comment on the issue through social media but even he seemed to sit on the fence and be diplomatic. 
“Players should tell what they feel, as a team captain if we won’t share the problem of our players, who will ?” writes Pradhan on Facebook.  “Having said that I feel, there have also been some positive steps taken for the betterment of basketball in recent days. And to maintain this, the ultimate solution might be joining hands together. Above everything, respecting each other’s efforts and moving forward.” 
In denial
Bhim Singh Gurung 
Gurung has held the position of acting president for the past two years. One of his primary responsibilities in this role was to oversee the election of new committee members, a duty he has seemingly distanced himself from. Sadina Shrestha raises valid questions about the legitimacy of Gurung’s position.
Onlinekhabar reached out to Gurung to talk about the incident but he was reluctant to talk about it. 
“The association has a big dream for basketball so it doesn’t matter who said what,” says Gurung. “We are gearing up to host the Nepal Basketball League for the first time in history and I think our focus should be on that.”
The league is due to start on September 29. 
Gurung said that he has yet to see Shrestha’s post, in which she challenged the statement he made against her on national television."

Nepal’s 4Merical eSports wins MCB MLBB Champion Battles 
","The Nepali cricket team welcomed at the airport on September 6. 
After battling it out against two of the best ODI cricket teams in the world, India and Pakistan, the Nepali cricket team returned home on September 6 after taking part in the Asia Cup. As expected, the team was warmly welcomed by eager fans and media upon their arrival at the Tribhuvan International Airport.
The excitement surrounding Nepal’s matches against Pakistan and India was evident. Crowds gathered to watch the game, and political leaders shared photos of themselves enjoying the match. What was particularly heartening was witnessing individuals and organisations announcing cash prizes for every four, six, and wicket.
Balen Shah, the Mayor of Kathmandu metropolitan city, travelled to Sri Lanka to watch the match against India. Upon his return, he declared that the city would undertake the construction of a stadium, provided the government allocates 12.57 acres of land. He stood out as the sole political leader to pledge investment in infrastructure.
Nepali cricket has gone up a level. The team’s performance since February serves as a testament to this progress. Their participation in the Asia Cup further highlighted just how much the cricket team has progressed. Nevertheless, the infrastructure has remained stagnant. This has prompted many to ponder on the potential outcomes if the state had invested in creating a more conducive environment and better facilities for the team.
Grounds for progress
File: Underconstruction Mulpani Cricket Stadium
The country only has one proper cricket ground in the country – the TU Cricket Ground. Even that does not have proper facilities as many call it archaic. Mulpani International Cricket Ground, which was envisioned over two decades, is not complete as the country barely holds international level tournaments at the TU Cricket Ground.
“The players even have problems training because we do not have proper training facilities,” says Rohit Paudel, captain of the Nepali national cricket team who calls on leaders to develop the infrastructure.
Cricket teams of all age groups train at the TU Cricket Ground. There have been instances where three teams either train simultaneously or have to wait for one to conclude before they can begin their training sessions.
When Nepal qualified to take part in the World Cup Qualifier in Zimbabwe, Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal announced he would ensure floodlights are set up at the TU Cricket Ground. However, the installation of lights was halted due to a mistake in the tender procedure issued by the National Sports Council. It remains uncertain when the next tender will be issued.
The project to build two cricket stadiums at Mulpani has also not been completed. Even though the ground did hold matches during the ACC Premier Cup, the stadium is still not complete 20 years on.
Although the government has announced plans to develop the infrastructure of both international stadiums, work has not been carried out. The government while announcing the annual budget for 2022/23 said new cricket stadiums will be built in Biratnagar, Baitadi, Kailali and Kathmandu. However, the plan has not materialised yet.
Paudel says the team now needs conditions and pitches to ensure they play better in the international tournaments they take part in. This, he says, will only happen if the country has more cricket grounds.
“The game is all about confidence. We need to have pitches that are spin-friendly and pace-friendly so that we can prepare accordingly,” says Paudel.
The next step

Nepal’s performance against both India and Pakistan was commendable. The scorecard might show it was a one-sided game, but there were instances where Nepal showed they were there for a fight. The Nepali cricket team even caught the eyes of many globally announcing themselves on the biggest stage. This has built the confidence in the players that they can go toe to toe against the best in the world.
“While playing against India we tackled a number of short balls.  We played well even when their best ballers were bowling against us,” says Paudel. “The more we play against them, the better we will get.”
The Cricket Association of Nepal believes the team can take on anyone after taking on the number one and two ODI teams in the world.
“The Nepali cricket team was nervous against Pakistan but the way we stepped up against India was quite amazing. This team and go a long way,” says Pradeep Majgaiyan, the team’s manager.
Paudel expressed gratitude on behalf of the team to players such as Paras Khadka, Shakti Gauchan, and others who played instrumental roles in elevating Nepali cricket to new heights. He vowed that this current team would continue to uphold and build upon this legacy.
Power of positivity

After his appointment as head coach in February, Monty Desai has been promoting the message of a happy dressing room. To ensure everyone is together, he has done a lot. That, the players believe has been key as they have played with a fearless attitude as seen against India.
Take Aasif Sheikh’s performance against India. Upon returning to Nepal, Sheikh said how his 58 against India has instilled confidence in him and this was mostly due to Desai’s power of positive thinking.
Desai went a step further and personally requested Indian players to present medals to Nepali cricketers who performed well in the match. Sheikh expressed a sense of pride in receiving a medal from cricketing icon Virat Kholi.
Along with Sheikh, Sompal Kami and Dipendra Sing Airee were also awarded medals from Hardik Pandya and Rahul Dravid respectively.
The team had a great outing at the Asia Cup. Players had interactions with the best in the world who wished them the best. However, the team needs more tha just wishes. They need a better foundation so the next time they play, they can push these teams to the limit.
While this tournament provided a valuable learning opportunity, CAN knows the pressing need to invest in the team. The government is also aware of this necessity, and learning opportunity, CAN knows that it needs to invest in the team. The government knows this too and the investment needs to come fast or else we will see a repeat of what happened in 2014 when Nepal took part in the World T20 In Bangladesh.

We all watched with pride as the Nepal cricket team took on cricket powerhouses India and Pakistan in the Asia Cup. While the results might not have been in our favour, the mere presence of our national team on such a prestigious stage was an extraordinary achievement.
However, behind this moment of glory lies an incredible journey that deserves to be celebrated. A journey filled with emotions, inspiration, challenges, and unforgettable drama.
In every sense, this is a miraculous story.
Extraordinary expedition

This extraordinary journey began in February when we appointed Monty Desai as the head coach of the Nepal cricket team. At the time, we were second from bottom in the ICC Cricket World Cup League 2 table. For those unfamiliar with this competition, it is a four-year-long cycle determining entry into the World Cup qualifiers.
We found ourselves in an almost impossible position: we needed to secure 11 wins out of the remaining 12 games to progress. Our team, led by the young captain Rohit Paudel, embarked on this uphill climb with unwavering determination.
On the eve of the first tri-series against Scotland and Namibia, opener Kushal Bhurtel suffered a personal crisis. The situation was serious as she had to be rushed to Kathmandu for treatment.
Despite the emotional turmoil, Bhurtel remained resolute. He took the field against Namibia and guided the Nepal cricket team to an awe-inspiring chase of 286, notching up an impressive 115 runs off 113 balls. Nepal clean swept the series beating Namibia and Scotland twice in little over a week.
While we were competing in a tri-series in the UAE, the Nepal cricket team faced another crisis. One of our leg spinners, Shyam Dhakal suffered an injury, requiring a replacement. The ICC would only approve the replacement once they received a detailed report from our team physio. However, the physio faced a tough situation as his pregnant wife went into labour in Kathmandu. Balancing his professional duties with this personal crisis was a challenge.
Then, Sandeep Lamichhane stepped in. But his inclusion came at a high price. Lamichhane was caught up in a serious personal controversy and faced allegations of raping a minor. His inclusion in the team sparked protests and he encountered hostility both on and off the field.
Nevertheless, Lamichhane demonstrated courage and talent, taking 13 wickets in his initial matches. His performances were nothing short of miraculous given the circumstances. Despite the controversies surrounding him, he remained our star performer.
Perseverance led path

It is safe to say our path to success was littered with adversity, but we persevered. We went on to win ten out of 11 games, setting the stage for a thrilling showdown against the UAE in a packed TU stadium on March 16. 
The stage was set. In order to advance to the World Cup Qualifiers in Zimbabwe, the Nepal cricket team faced the daunting task of chasing down 311 runs, marking our highest-ever ODI chase.
Thanks to crucial knocks from our middle and lower-middle order, we achieved the impossible. The game hinged on the DLS method, and the TU ground erupted with joy as Gulshan Jha, a young talent, scored 20 runs in the 44th over against UAE skipper Muhammed Waseem. The scenes were surreal, and the memory still sends shivers down our spines.
Next, we entered the Asia Cup qualifiers, known as the ACC Men’s Premier Cup, with high hopes. The winner would earn a coveted spot in the Asia Cup, a prestigious cricket competition in Asia. One match worth mentioning was our encounter with Qatar. We had lost nine wickets for 111 runs, seemingly facing defeat.
However, our last-wicket partnership pushed us to 157 runs, while we bowled out Qatar for 89. Lamichhane, the man of the match, not only took five wickets but also scored 48 runs. Then came the final, and the rest is history. Despite all odds, Lamichhane was named the Player of the Tournament, a testament to his resilience and cricketing prowess.
In the culminate

While our performance in the Asia Cup may not have been stellar, our batters’ courage against pace and our bowlers’ tenacity made an indelible mark. On the world stage, we showcased formidable talent.
A year ago, we struggled to secure victories, but today, we boast a formidable batting lineup and a bowling attack that can challenge any opponent globally. Our strength lies in our unity, where every team member plays an equally vital role.
We will never forget the contributions of players like Kushal Bhurtel, Aasif Sheikh, Rohit Poudel, Bhim Sharki, Kushal Malla, Dipendra Singh Airee, Aarif Sheikh, Gulshan Jha, Sompal Kami, Karan KC, Sandeep Lamichhane, and Lalit Narayan Rajbanshi. 
Each one has etched their name into our hearts with remarkable performances.
As we continue our journey on the global stage, the world watches with anticipation. The Nepali cricket team’s story is not just about cricket; it embodies hope, resilience, and the unwavering belief that dreams are attainable with dedication and perseverance."

Thailand humbled Nepal in the Women’s T20 World Cup Asia Qualifier on Friday to book a place in the final and qualify for the global qualifier.
Chasing 106 runs, Nepal could only manage to score 59 runs losing all their wickets in 19.3 overs losing the match by 46 runs.
Winning the toss, Nepal chose to bowl first and got off to a great start by sending Suwanan Khiaoto back to the pavilion in the fourth ball of the match.
The game then went south as Nepal could not pick up wickets has a late burst took Thailand to 105 in their allotted 20 overs. Nannapat Koncharoenkai top scored with 59 to give the Thais tha perfect base.
In reply, Nepal started off poorly. By the fifth over, Nepal had lost four wickets for eight runs which gave the middle and lower order a tough task to chase down the total.
Thailand, however, did not let Nepal back into the game as they picked up regular wickets to bowl them out for 59 runs."

Kathmandu, September 5
In a historic development, Nepal’s volleyball players, both male and female, have begun receiving monthly salaries for the first time. 
This was made possible through a collaborative effort involving business persons, former international players and a volleyball enthusiast residing in the United States.
The Nepal Volleyball Association recently announced the initiation of monthly salary disbursements to its players, marking a groundbreaking moment in the sport’s history within the nation. Under this scheme, a total of 24 players are each receiving Rs 5,000 per month.
The funds to support this endeavour were generously sent by donors based in the United States, and these financial contributions were made in instalments during the months of September, October, and November.
On Tuesday, NVA distributed three months’ salaries, equating to Rs 15,000 each to the players.
The players expressed their delight and gratitude upon receiving their monthly salaries for the first time. 
“I have been involved in the sport for 14-15 years, and this is the first time such a remarkable initiative has come to fruition,” said women’s captain Aruna Shahi.
Man Bahadur Shrestha, the captain of the men’s team, hailed this as a historic milestone for Nepali volleyball.
Notably, the Nepal Volleyball Association is now the fourth sports association in Nepal to distribute salaries to athletes after cricket, football and chess."

In 2023, Barbie named Women in Sports as their career of the year.
Whenever I am out and about socially, there is always someone who seems pretty certain about not considering my profession as mainstream. Hold up! Sports as a career? In Nepal? You bet! This article aims to explain why women in this male-dominant sports industry in Nepal should not be viewed as a surprise.
I have been part of the Nepali cricket industry in a private capacity for quite a while now. Armed with a Master’s Degree in IT from an American University, my choice to stick with sports management tends to raise eyebrows. While I am not an on-field player, I am definitely behind the scenes, playing strong games of serious deliverance with my team. We are all about creating what is not there.
As untouched and less discussed as the sports management industry is in Nepal, it has ample room to showcase creativity. Being a commanding woman in a position can be challenging, but on the brighter side, the gender advantage has yet to fail me. As alien as I might be in sports management in Nepal, I have been accepted with open arms. The nature of the job is highly competitive, no doubt.
Embraced by the sports fraternity

Women in sports are safe, heard, and welcomed. I absolutely relish the addition of spirited women to the team. The nuances of sports are something women complement greatly. Sports management inherently rejects narrow minds. There is a lot of travelling, meeting people, experimenting, and remembering limitations. The adjustments are both trivial and clever. 
Often, in our part of the world, societal norms limit women from making career decisions, hindering them from living life on their terms. This restriction potentially keeps many capable women from pursuing the sports industry, where they could truly wield their power to make an impact. Change is gradual, and I hope to see numerous female faces in charge of stadiums someday in Nepal.
Yes, there are challenges. It ranges from personal sacrifices to job security and opportunities. However, these are workable factors for any freelancer in sports management. The key is excelling at our jobs to thrive anywhere. 
Taking a page from the medical field, the seriousness we apply there should not differ in sports management. Sports is a powerful industry. Children grow up idolising what we showcase on TV. As glorious as the game is, it is every child’s dream to represent their country someday. Carrying that responsibility is our role in sports—an often thankless yet deeply satisfying job.
Nepali sports industry
The fans went wild at TU Cricket Ground after Nepal beat UAE.
Sports may be a smaller industry in Nepal, but globally, it is a behemoth. The world economy has shifted, and it is time we alter our perspective to recognise the potential of sports as an industry in Nepal. The idea of open commercialisation of sports remains somewhat unexplored, as it continues to be a more exclusive affair in Nepal. 
By sourcing innovative ideas, there’s a wealth of public attention and investment waiting to be tapped into, along with numerous practices to establish and discard. As the Nepali team achieves international records, the packaging of the sport becomes everything. There is plenty to learn from international sports management to make our industry highly marketable and poised for global entry.
Sports such as cricket, football, volleyball, or even golf serve as key intersections for reshaping Nepal’s global narrative. Over the years, Kabaddi has witnessed a substantial surge in India, both in terms of viewership and commercial success. The primary challenge we grapple with is Nepal’s comparatively small market size, posing constraints on our ability to generate substantial economic gains. Therefore, there is unanimous agreement on the imperative for Nepal’s sports to venture onto the international stage.
Nepal boasts many hardworking individuals, yet achieving this goal demands specialised talents in sports management with the requisite experience and the capacity to enhance existing values. In the long run, outsourcing such talents may foster dependence. Hence, a concerted effort is needed to inspire Nepali youth to engage in sports management, contributing to our sports ecosystem. 
There are various ways in which we can harness the potential of sports for our benefit. Encouraging youth involvement can be instrumental in capitalising on the multifaceted opportunities presented by the sports industry. There is a lot to explore if you think about it."

","Painting ‘My Private Life’ by artist Priyam Pradhan at the exhibition Mani at Siddhartha Art Gallery, Baber Mahal. Photo: Chandra Bahadur Ale
Using Pitt’s artist pen on paper, artist Priyam Pradhan presents My Private Life, a showcase of the current significance of his life depicted in abstract form.
At the centre of the painting is a 1000-rupee note, within which Pradhan has intricately painted Lord Krishna, a man wearing a hoodie tenderly embracing his dog, and a woman. The woman stands tall, elongated in form. Towards the bottom of the canvas, a holy man reaches out his hands, appearing to be in flight.
Priyam Pradhan has used a vibrant colour palette, incorporating bright hues such as pink, orange, and yellow, as well as green, black, white, and grey. This combination adds a dynamic and lively quality to the artwork.
“The man in the centre is me and the girl in green is my girlfriend. And the faces are my mom and dad,” says Pradhan. “The sadhu (holy man) symbolises my desires that I don’t have many desires for materialistic things however I do understand the value of money.”
The use of colours, figures and lines in an abstract form in his painting resembles the painting of American painter Paul Jackson Pollock. Like his abstract expressionism, Pradhan has expressed himself in his painting.
Furthermore, this marks Priyam Pradhan’s third solo painting exhibition titled Mani (money), inaugurated on January 17 at Siddhartha Art Gallery, Baber Mahal.
In his previous exhibitions, Pradhan’s artworks centred around Hindu philosophy and his spontaneous thought process. However, in this latest exhibition, he explores the theme of money and its impact on an individual’s life, delving into the reverberating effects of financial aspects.
Understanding the value of money

Any form of art is known as a reflection of the contemporary time. Likewise, Priyam Pradhan’s paintings reflect the lifestyle, desires, obligations and more of today’s younger generation living in urban areas in Nepal.
Pradhan himself is in his 20s and he has justified the want of most of the youngsters in their 20s, who might be declared adults and understand the need for money and materialistic things but are still kids at their heart who want to explore and experience life as much as possible.
The exhibition has 27 paintings which Pradhan took around nine months to complete. According to him, while he was travelling the idea that his life was luxurious and him being capable of exploring anything he wanted to was because of money.
And being an artist this concept lingered on him and he was compelled to create on the theme of money.
Once you enter the gallery, you can also view an animated video, which introduces artist Pradhan and the importance of money, which is on the ground floor. On the first floor, a huge painting (193×62 in cm) Apatkalin Awastha using mixed media on canvas welcomes you and other paintings are small in size (18×30 in cm).
“It is a team work and it is my introduction as an artist for the exhibition,” he says. “Also, being a recent multimedia graduate from Islington College, I wanted to explore my skills and I got my team. Then, like money, multimedia is relevant to current society.”
Experiencing life through art

Priyam Pradhan says enjoyment is the meaning of life and he enjoys creating artwork. Moreover, Pradhan who came into the art world first being a tattoo artist feels blessed that he has the privilege to explore whatever he likes in his life.
He also believes that the philosophy that says one should not be materialistic is wrong. “If material things are not important, why would one build a house? And after building a house why do they want to decorate their house?” he questions.
Alongside, money and materialistic things, his paintings also explore love, romance, life and childhood experiences. Motifs like Pokemon, ramen noodles, animals, dancers, etc have been used in his paintings. In most of his paintings, he has used numerous white lines in wavy form and these lines for Pradhan indicate the sound or the energy that exists in the surroundings all the time.
About using a pitta artist pen, he says, “I have enjoyed drawing and painting since my childhood and using a pitta artist pen helps me revisit that feeling of happiness and sense of freedom.”
So many things happening on the canvas with the use of vibrant colours gives a sense of excitement to the viewers. Though referencing artists like Pollock, MF Husain, Picasso and more, his pen strokes give a sense of newness through his expression and thoughts about his life experiences.
In his paintings, these bright colours and motifs are in harmony and are visual treats that can surely cheer up the mood of any visitor. Moreover, you can also get free stickers from the artist.
If you too are in a gloomy mood and want to uplift a little, visit the exhibition that continues till February 6."

","Entrepreneurship education is not just an investment in the education system; it is an investment in the nation’s future prosperity. Photo: Pexels/ Rodnae Productions
In the shadow of the towering Himalayas, Nepal faces a challenge that rivals the steepness of its mountainous terrain- the challenge of economic development. As the nation earnestly pursues its Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), it becomes increasingly evident that a transformation in the education system is not only necessary but also urgent. 
Rooted in common living strategies, the prevailing education model, especially in higher education, may not adequately prepare the youth for the demands of the modern world. 
In this critical juncture, the incorporation of entrepreneurship education emerges as a beacon of hope, offering a pathway towards a self-reliant and prosperous Nepal.
Time to reevaluate the education system
Nepal’s journey towards economic prosperity has been marked by challenges that demand innovative solutions. The commitment of the SDGs reflects not only a global responsibility but also a domestic imperative for sustainable development. For this, it is high time to reevaluate the education system in the country.
The current education system in Nepal, deeply entrenched in common living strategies, has been the foundation of learning for generations. However, in the face of a rapidly evolving world, today’s generation aspires for more than the status quo. The call for independence reverberates through the aspirations of youth who seek a curriculum fostering critical thinking, innovation and entrepreneurial skills.
Entrepreneurship education is a dynamic force capable of reshaping Nepal’s educational landscape. This innovative approach moves beyond traditional learning methods, providing students with the tools to navigate the complexities of the modern world. At its core, entrepreneurship education is about empowering students to implement learned information in practical and tangible ways.
Consider a student engrossed in the intricacies of sensor systems during a science class, entrepreneurship education transforms this theoretical knowledge into practical applications, inspiring the creation of a sensor-operated door. Such innovation born from a fusion of science and entrepreneurship becomes a valuable mindset in solving practical problems.  
Expanding the horizons of entrepreneurship education, let us delve into chemistry. Imagine students studying chemistry not just as a theoretical subject, but also as entrepreneurs in the making. Armed with entrepreneurial principles, these students can tap into Nepal’s rich biodiversity, exploring market demands for products derived from local plants.
In the scenario, chemistry students could embark on a journey to develop performance-enhancing products based on market demand, harnessing the potential of indigenous flora. What makes this approach remarkable is that it does not necessarily require sophisticated machines or extensive human resources. Instead, it leverages the inherent skills and awareness of individuals within the community, paving the way for a grassroots economic revolution.
Entrepreneurship in education

The beauty of entrepreneurship education lies in its universal applicability. It is not confined to science or chemistry alone. Consider an art student, for example. Through entrepreneurship education, they can understand what art to develop (product), how much to set the price (price), where to sell (place) and how to sell (promote) their artworks. Every subject becomes a canvas for innovation and enterprise.
Moreover, entrepreneurship education is a powerful equaliser, recognising the unique skills and talents of individuals across various disciplines. It is not about fitting into a predefined mould but rather about unleashing the potential within each student. When every single person is aware of their skills and potential, they can rise to different levels, contributing to the overall progress of the nation.
Entrepreneurship education goes beyond skill recognition; it is about nurturing the ability to produce goods and mastering the art of marketing. Returning to the example of the student developing a sensor-operated door, entrepreneurship education not only equips them to produce the product but also teaches them how to navigate the complexities of marketing it to potential users and clients.
The impact of entrepreneurship education extends beyond individual success stories; it reverberates through the entire nation. A generation equipped with entrepreneurial skills becomes a driving force for economic growth and independence. They will be able to recognise the resources and ideas to utilise them to reach the global market. They will be able to be the pioneers in products and contribute to the economy. By fostering a culture of innovation, creativity and self-reliance, Nepal can reduce its dependence on external sources and strengthen its economy from within.
In essence, entrepreneurship education is not just an investment in the education system; it is an investment in the nation’s future prosperity. It is a transformative force that has the potential to shape a generation of independent thinkers, innovators and entrepreneurs- the architects of a self-reliant and economically vibrant Nepal. Entrepreneurship education, by teaching students to utilise available resources (physical and financial) and make them commercial, becomes a cornerstone in the nation’s journey towards economic empowerment and independence."

Women’s T20 World Cup Asia Qualifier: Thailand beat Nepal to qualify for the global qualifier
","Ram Bujhaun Yadav with his land ownership certificate stands near a border pillar which he says was erroneously placed on his land. 
In October 2023, when 51-year-old Ram Bujhaun Yadav of Musaharnia Rural Municipality-5, Mukhiyapatti, Dhanusha, was at a relative’s house, someone told him that two Indian Sashastra Seema Bal (SSB) personnel were looking for him.
Anxious, he rushed home wondering why they were looking for him.
“They asked me if the paddy field in the no man’s land was mine. I told them yes and they asked me to cut down the paddy immediately,” he said.
The paddy was not ripe and Yadav asked them for some time. However, the SSB personnel told him he had to cut down his paddy immediately.
Ram Bujhaun and his wife Tetari Devi each own a 677-square-metre plot of land. As Nepal and India reevaluated the border, Ram Bujhan’s land was been deemed to be near the no man’s land as it now has two demarcation pillars.
Frustrated, Ram Bujhaun cut the paddy before it was due to be harvested. Now, he has been asked to not plant anything on the land as it falls in the no man’s land.
“Our border police don’t say a word. I can’t fight the SSB on my own,” says Ram Bujhaun adding he had decided not to plan anything on the land anymore.
Woes of the farmers
Many farmers in southern Nepal say their land has now been placed in India after the recent demarcation. 
When the Jamuna River, which flows through the no man’s land between Nepal and India, changed its course some two decades ago, some border pillars went missing. Locals say these pillars have now been placed encroaching on Nepali land.
In 2018, with the then Chief District Officer of Dhanusha, Pradeep Raj Kandel, and an official from Madhubani district, Bihar, India, a team that included border security forces from both countries, the Armed Police Force of Nepal, and SSB of India began placing border pillars after land measurement by technicians.
Locals have raised concerns, stating that border pillars have been positioned, encroaching approximately 50 to 100 meters of land into Nepal compared to the previous position. Many like Ram Bujhaun are unaware of when these border pillars were placed.
“I did not know that pillar was placed here. After I found out when I asked the village leaders, many said they were placing the border pillars as they pleased,” said Ram Bujhaun.
He was told to carry on planting paddy and that it would not matter as these issues had happened in the past. 
“They encroached on my land and have asked me not to plant anything. This is gross injustice,” he says.
Ram Bujhaun’s family owns a total of 4,000 square metres of land, with 2,000 square metres belonging to him and the remaining 2,000 square metres to his brother Bechan. However, 1,000 square metres of his land is now located on the Indian side after the demarcation. Despite this, he has been farming on the land and continues to pay taxes to the Department of Land Management and Archive in Nepal.
“They have marked my land to be on the Indian side and placed border pillars on it. I’ve been farming till now but I don’t know when they will ask me to stop,” he says.
Ignorance of the government
The Madhesh province in southern Nepal
The former ward chair of Mukhiyapatti Musharniya Rural Municipality-5, Ram Naresh Yadav, said that over time, India has encroached on numerous Nepali lands in various locations in the Madhesh Province. This, he says, happened due to the Nepali administration’s ignorance and weak stature.
“They (Nepali administration) were careless and that meant the Indian side placed these border pillars by encroaching on Nepali land,” says Ram Naresh.
He said that over 40 farmers from wards 1, 5, and 6 have land ranging from 300 to 1,600 square metres on the Indian side. 
“These farmers have land ownership certificates, but they cannot farm as the SSB says the land is in India and not Nepal,” said Ram Naresh.
In 1996, land ownership certificates were distributed after surveying the land in the border area. Local Dharmendra Kumar Yadav said that since then, the locals have been paying their land tax regularly. In 2018, when the pillar was being placed, the locals protested when they saw their land was being encroached on. However, since the demarcation had been agreed upon by high-ranking government officials of Nepal and India, the farmer’s voices went unheard.
“We tried to stop when the border pillars were being placed on our land. But the administrators from both sides forcibly put it there without even trying to hold a discussion,” said Harish Chandra Yadav. 
The Chief District Officer of Dhanusha, Chakrapani Pandey, says that the border pillars were placed by the technical team after the measurements and with the agreement of the high-ranking officials of the two countries.
“The fields and houses that are built in no man’s land have recently been cleared. No one can do anything in this particular area,” said Pandey. “We understand the people’s concern but we cannot do anything about it now.”"

Women’s T20 World Cup Asia Qualifier: Nepal to play Thailand in the semi-final after rain abandons crunch UAE tie
","Regenerative braking representational image. Photo: Freepik
The electric vehicle market in Nepal has grown significantly over the past year. 
Electric four-wheelers and two-wheelers are being launched almost every month, spanning from passenger to commercial vehicles. Electric transportation appears to be an emerging trend in the automotive industry.
New EVs are regularly introduced with advanced features as car companies develop unique electric platforms. One standout feature is regenerative braking.
Regenerative braking was first introduced in 1967 by the American Motor Car Company (AMC) in their prototype electric vehicle, the AMC Amitron. However, Toyota became the automobile manufacturer to implement regenerative braking system (RBS) technology in their Prius series hybrid vehicles in 1997. Toyota brought up the new hybrid technology in the Prius when fuel prices were going up at a massive rate.

But what is regenerative braking? There are still many people confused about what it is, whether it is safe or helpful in fuel economy in hybrid cars and the regeneration of electricity in electric cars.
In simple terms, regen braking is when a car saves energy by recharging its battery when you brake, helping it use less fuel or electricity and go further. Easy but scientifically, regen braking is a process used in vehicles where the kinetic energy produced during braking is converted into electrical energy through an electric motor acting as a generator. This electrical energy is then stored in the vehicle’s battery for later use, reducing energy wastage and increasing overall efficiency.
Photo: Freepik
Regen braking can be seen in all kinds of EVs, including cars, scooters, commercial vans, buses, bicycles, three-wheelers, and rickshaws. It now can be electrically managed to what extent the power and braking can be generated. 
Regenerative Braking work process in EV

Principle of Operation: Regene braking works by turning the energy from slowing down into electricity.
Electric Motor as a Generator: In EV or hybrid cars with regen braking, the motor changes roles from moving the car to making electricity when you brake.
Switching Polarity: When you brake, the motor switches directions, turning energy from the wheels into electricity instead of using it to move the car.
Generation of Electricity: The turning wheels make the motor produce electricity, which goes to the car’s battery.
Power Electronics: Special electronics change the electricity from the motor into the right kind for charging the battery.
Battery Charging: The electricity made during braking charges up the car’s battery, storing the energy for later.
Integration with Hydraulic Braking System: Regenerative braking works with the regular brakes, blending them for smooth stopping.

Advantages and Disadvantages of Regenerative Braking 
The advantages are listed below:

Energy Efficiency: Regenerative braking efficiently captures the kinetic energy generated during braking, effectively reducing energy wastage and contributing to a more sustainable driving experience.
Extended Range: By using the energy that would otherwise be lost during braking as heat and sound, regenerative braking helps to extend the driving range of electric vehicles in instances such as travelling downhill. 
Reduced Brake Wear: Regenerative braking minimizes the strain on traditional braking components, mitigating wear and tear, and potentially extending the lifespan of the braking components such as brake pads, rotors and brake lines, thus reducing maintenance costs over time.
Enhanced Driving Experience: Regenerative braking provides a smoother braking experience and a more responsive feel to drivers, enhancing overall driving comfort and control on the road.

The disadvantages are listed below:

Limited Effectiveness at Low Speeds: While regenerative braking efficiently recaptures energy during braking, its effectiveness diminishes at lower speeds which leads to decreased energy recovery compared to higher speeds.
Complexity and Cost: Implementing regenerative braking adds complexity and cost to vehicle systems, potentially raising manufacturing and maintenance expenses, and impacting consumer affordability.
Maintenance Requirements: Regenerative braking systems require periodic maintenance and calibration to ensure they operate optimally.
Efficiency Variability: Regenerative braking may exhibit variability in efficiency under extreme weather conditions or on certain road surfaces, leading to fluctuations in overall energy recapture and impacting the vehicle’s efficiency.

Misconceptions

Fully Recharges Battery: Some mistakenly believe that regenerative braking fully replenishes the battery, but in reality, it only adds a modest amount of charge.
Increases Braking Distances: There is a misconception that regenerative braking extends braking distances, but it enhances braking performance by complementing traditional brakes.
High-Speed Only: While more effective at higher speeds, regenerative braking still functions at lower speeds, such as during city driving or stop-and-go traffic.
Maintenance-Free: Despite requiring less maintenance than traditional brakes, regen braking systems still need periodic checks and maintenance to ensure proper operation.
Significantly Boosts Range: While regen braking contributes to extending the driving range of electric vehicles, its impact is influenced by various factors beyond just braking efficiency.
Only for Electric Cars: Although commonly associated with electric vehicles, regen braking systems are also found in some conventional vehicles, particularly those aiming to improve fuel efficiency with advanced technology.

Regenerative braking might sound complicated, but it is pretty cool. Think of it as a way for EVs and hybrids to recycle energy when they slow down. Instead of just wasting that energy, regenerative braking turns it into electricity, which can then be used to power the battery."

As the gates to the vet clinic at the Central Zoo in Lalitpur opened, more than two dozen photojournalists thronged the facility and surrounded a metal cage aiming their DSLR cameras at a snow leopard inside.
“Please don’t come close to the animal,” the zoo’s vet, Radha Krishna Gharti, told approaching photojournalists. But in the gush of excitement to take exclusive photographs of the elusive cat, difficult to spot even in its prime habitats, there were few takers for the word of caution.
Nepal’s Department of National Parks and Wildlife Conservation (DNPWC) organised the photo-op two days after the male subadult cat, which was until recently found in the country only at altitudes higher than 2,000-6,000 metres above sea level, was brought to the zoo from Urlabari town(146 m above sea level). According to the department, the animal has sustained injuries to its right foreleg and cannot stand upright.
Although officials involved said they are looking at releasing the animal into the wild after it recuperates, doing so will be a daunting task, adding that the zoo may be the only place where it can now survive.

“Nepali snow leopard experts have come up with two hypotheses to explain how the animal from the mountains landed up in the plains,” said Sharad Chandra Adhikari, member-secretary at the National Trust for Nature Conservation (NTNC), a semi-government body that manages the zoo in Lalitpur, a town in the Kathmandu Valley. 
The first of the two hypotheses made public during the photo-op-cum-press conference, is that it was raised in captivity and somehow managed to escape into the wild. The second is that it lost its orientation while trying to establish its territory after separating from its mother.
Kulbhushansingh Suryawanshi, director of the India program, Snow Leopard Trust, said that both hypotheses are plausible explanations as to how the snow leopard got to the plains in Nepal.
A DNPWC official, who wished to remain anonymous as he is not authorised to talk to the press, said that it was more likely that the animal had been raised in captivity. 
“The way it sipped the water and ate the food zoo staff offered indicates that it may have been raised in captivity,” the official said.
Snow leopards are shy cats living at extreme altitudes in the steep mountainous areas of 12 countries in Central and South Asia. Their global population spread over altitudes of 500-5,800 m, is estimated to be between around 3,900 and 6,000 as detailed coordinated surveys of the population in the range countries are yet to be carried out. In Nepal, their population divided into three blocks (eastern, central and western) is estimated to be between 301 and 400.
Adhikari from NTNC said that researchers will now examine the animal’s scat to analyse its diet and try to find out whether it was roaming in the wild or had been in some sort of captivity. Researchers are also preparing to analyse its genes to try to find out to which of the three metapopulations in Nepal it belongs. They will also observe the animal’s canine teeth and fur to look for clues.
Relocation challenge

The whole process could take a few months to complete, and summer could set in in Kathmandu by then, officials concede. 
“The current temperature in Kathmandu is suitable for snow leopards, as we are in the peak of winter,” said Madhu Chetri, a snow leopard researcher from NTNC. But that could change as spring season begins in the Northern Hemisphere.
The DNPWC official said that regardless of the findings related to how the animal got to Urlabarli, the animal would have spent a significant amount of time with humans during its recovery phase. “That would mean that it would have gotten habituated with having humans around,” the official said.
Sending such animals back into the wild is a challenge, as they may have lost their hunting and other adaptation skills, he added. In May last year, officials at the Chitwan National Park released two rescued rhino calves into the wild, with limited success. The safety of the animals, which had gotten used to having humans around, was compromised as poachers could easily approach and kill them. Eventually, they were transferred to an enclosure in eastern Nepal away from human intervention.
Veteran conservationist Professor Karan Bahadur Shah said that rewilding the snow leopard would be a daunting task, as the animals are territorial. “If we just leave the animal in its natural habitat, it will get killed by other snow leopards defending their territory,” he said. “The best option would be to keep the animal in the zoo for the public to see.”
But Nepal’s Central Zoo has its own set of problems. The facility, established in 1932 as a private collection, has limited space and has frequently run into financial trouble. Conservationists say the snow leopard would need special facilities to cater to its needs.
“If the government decides that the snow leopard needs to remain at the zoo, we are ready to shoulder the responsibility,” said Adhikari. “We have set up special facilities for animals such as the red panda and chimpanzees,” he said. “We can do that for the snow leopard as well.”
Those advocating for keeping the animal in the zoo also said that Nepal is a snow leopard range country and the public, especially the young generation, also needs to see the different animals found in the country. “It has great educational value,” said Shah.
Snow leopard expert Suryawanshi from neighbouring India also said that it would be challenging to release the animal into the wild. 
“If the team at the zoo can establish the exact cause of this behaviour [why it ventured into the plains] and can keep the animal away from human contact, then it might be okay to release it back,” he said. “But otherwise, there is little hope for it in the wild. Better to let it live in the zoo.”
Back at the zoo, after the photojournalists are done taking photos, it is the turn of the reporters to point their smartphones at the animal. Then there is a contingent of senior wildlife department officials waiting in line to catch a glimpse of the animal. 
“So much for keeping it away from human contact,” a conservationist observing the hullabaloo from a distance said.

Posts navigation,"The National Assembly was formed to give experienced people a chance to be part of the parliament and help during the formation of important bills. In countries that follow the Westminster model of government, the upper house plays an important role. That, however, is not the case in Nepal as the country’s upper house has become a platform where individuals secure positions in the National Assembly based on their connections. As the election nears, many once again question the relevance and existence of the upper house.
Things were different in the past as the initial years of the National Assembly saw experienced politicians and experts others in their field be nominated for the post. That slowly changed as the first batch completed its two-year term.
“I understand why people are frustrated with the upper house. People expected experts but all we got was party cadres who lacked knowledge or experience,” says Bimala Rai Paudyal a National Assembly member. “Considering such behaviour and practices, what distinguishes the House of Representatives from the National Assembly?”
A loser’s second chance 
Narayan Kaji Shrestha, who faced defeat in the 2017 general election from Gorkha-2, was elected as a member of the National Assembly on January 23, 2020. Elected from Gandaki Province, Shrestha currently is the Deputy Prime Minister and Home Minister of the country.
Bhagwati Neupane who lost the election from Gandaki province and Bimala Ghimire who lost the election for mayorship in Bhanu Municipality also shared the same trajectory.
Similarly, Mrigendra Kumar Singh Yadav and Jag Prasad Sharma were defeated in the House of Representatives elections, from Saptari-4 and Dang-3 respectively are now members of the National Assembly. Bam Dev Gautam, who lost the elections from Bardiya, secured a place in the upper house through nomination by President Bidya Devi Bhandari.
Even those who did not win as ward member(s) got the opportunity to become members of the National Assembly including Sindh Bahadur Bishwakarma who was appointed on February 7, 2018. He is soon leaving his post on March 3.
Despite the repeated criticisms, the political parties have not paid attention to this concern posed by political leaders and the general public. The latest proof of this is the list of candidates for the National Assembly elections scheduled on January 25. The list contains names like Krishna Prasad Sitaula, defeated in the House of Representatives elections in 2022 from Koshi Province, and Pooja Chaudhary, who lost in the provincial assembly elections 2022 from Rautahat-3 (a).
Speaker Ganesh Prasad Timilsina, who led the National Assembly for the entire six years under the federal system, is also dissatisfied with the individuals who have made it to the upper house. 
“The allegations are something for the parties to ponder upon. The leaders should have prioritised involving intellectuals/neutrals rather than managing its members,” he says.
The 59-member National Assembly elects eight representatives, equally from all seven provinces, with an additional three individuals nominated by the President. The Constitution ensures representation of women, Dalits, minorities or disabled communities, envisioning that experts, experienced individuals, and the most qualified people from various fields will become members of the National Assembly.
Easy way in
File: A National Assembly meeting
There are some reasons why leaders aspire to join the upper house, and even the leadership create opportunities for them. 
In National Assembly elections, voters consist of local-level heads/deputy heads and provincial assembly members. Typically, individuals seeking these positions undergo a vetting process by their respective parties. As a result, aspiring members of parliament can focus less on persuading individual voters and more on gaining party support to secure their candidacy. 
Moreover, being a member of the National Assembly opens avenues to ministerial roles. The constitution prohibits a National Assembly member from becoming the Prime Minister, but not Deputy Prime Minister. Due to such opportunities, leaders are enticed to seek a position in the assembly.
The National Assembly is currently in its fourth election cycle since the promulgation of the Consitution in 2015. Scheduled for January 25, this election aims to fill 19 seats vacated by individuals completing their six-year terms. The previous election cycles took place in 2017, involving 56 members, followed by 2019 with 18 positions, and 2020 with 19 positions.
The cascading impacts
File: A National Assembly meeting
Another reason why the National Assembly is finding it difficult to justify itself is that it has become a shadow of the House of Representatives. The meeting of the National Assembly did not have one session when the House of Representatives was dissolved by then Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli twice. The demands and issues raised by the opposition parties in the House of Representatives automatically went to the National Assembly, where the parliamentarians of the ruling party put forward any proposal, they endorse it the same as in the House of Representatives.
The latest example – is the main opposition UML did not allow the meeting of the House of Representatives to continue for five days from July 5, 2023, due to a statement made by Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal during his visit to India. Consequently, the meeting of the National Assembly was also paused during that period.
The UML obstructed the House of Representatives for almost a month starting mid-July last year demanding a high-level inquiry committee to probe the 60-kilogram gold smuggling case and the resignation of the Home Minister. The National Assembly followed suit with leaders pushing their agendas forward.
Speaker Ganesh Timilsina himself is dissatisfied that every behaviour and activity of the House of Representatives influence the National Assembly. He says despite his attempts to prevent the overshadowing, it has been unfortunate that he did not garner the goodwill of the top leaders during political disputes.
Reinstating power
The National Assembly is a permanent institution. Therefore, it can remain operational even in the absence of the House of Representatives. Under normal circumstances, Speaker Timilsina initiated a positive practice by personally participating in different committees. Nevertheless, in the absence of the House of Representatives, the National Assembly often experienced inactivity.
In December 2020, the Prime Minister at that time, KP Sharma Oli, dissolved the House of Representatives. Subsequently, a session of the National Assembly was convened on January 1, 2021. Despite lasting only seven hours over four days, this session, which took place after the dissolution, failed to address crucial public issues. Even after six months, important matters remained unaddressed within the House.
On May 22, 2021, the UML-led government once again dissolved the House of Representatives. The meeting of the National Assembly and committees was affected once more. However, the dissolutions were declared unconstitutional by the Supreme Court, reinstating the parliament.
The Constitution says that despite the closing of the National Assembly session, thematic committee meetings can still take place. However, both the National Assembly and its committees remained inactive until the restoration of the House of Representatives.
According to Khimlal Devkota, a member of the National Assembly, when the House of Representatives was dissolved twice, it seemed that the National Assembly was also in a state of dissolution.
Bimala Rai Paudyal also believes that the inability to resume the upper house is a mark of weakness. 
“Since the government was not in a position to call, the President needed to be consulted by the chair together with the consultation committee. That was not done either,” she says.
Constitutional and legal distinctions

Except for the Constitution of Nepal (1962) and the Interim Constitution of Nepal (2007), all other constitutions in Nepal provided for a bicameral parliament with the National Assembly or the Upper House and the House of Representatives or the Lower House. The practices before 2015 were under the unitary governance system, but after the adoption of the federal democratic republican governance system, the role of the National Assembly has changed somewhat.
In the preamble of the constitution prepared by the ‘Constituent Assembly, and Administrative Organ Designation Committee’ during the drafting of the constitution, it is mentioned that some different qualifications have been prescribed for being a member of the House of Representatives and the National Assembly, with the intention that qualified people can be represented in the National Assembly.
Chair of the National Assembly Ganesh Prasad Timilsina restates that the members of the upper house should be assessed based on the country’s expectations with clear criteria. 
There is no definite definition of an expert in the constitution. It has been stated symbolically, “…It is expected that the members should have some basic skills to face the challenges and fulfil their responsibilities.”
According to the constitution, the responsibility of the National Assembly is to correctly establish the rights of the local level, state, and union, and to prevent the House of Representatives from trying to enact laws contrary to the spirit of federalism. There is an explanatory comment in the constitution about the propriety of the National Assembly – “This House is expected to fulfil its role to maintain creative and mutual relations between the national government and the provinces.”
In addition, there are some constitutional and legal differences regarding the National Assembly. But the MPs are demanding that it should cease. When a bill originating in the House of Representatives is passed and sent to the National Assembly, and if the latter does not decide within 60 days, it proceeds de facto.
This has placed the National Assembly in a dilemma. The Chairman of the National Assembly, Timilsina, says, “Such an arrangement should also apply to the House of Representatives, or both should be equal.”
Need for course correction 
PM Pushpa Kamal Dahal speaking in the National Assembly meeting.
Some instances have turned these so-called experts into a laughing stock due to their actions. 
On July 5, 2023,  a discussion on the Electronic Commerce (E-Commerce) Bill 2023 was tabled in the National Assembly. However, the parliamentarians misunderstood the main point and instead discussed the matter of electricity. The MPs, who had not read the proposal, suggested that electricity consumption within Nepal should also be increased besides exporting electricity to India and Bangladesh.
During the meeting, Ramesh Rijal, the Minister of Industry, Commerce and Supplies, also mentioned that India would purchase electricity during the Prime Minister’s visit. Unfortunately, the bill was unanimously approved.
Timilsina considers the incident an example, that in his six-year tenure, he does not want to remember. Som Bahadur Thapa, a former secretary at the Parliament Secretariat, termed the incident ‘a joke’ in the Parliament of Nepal. 
“This is strong proof of the kind of MPs we have, who speak without knowing what they are talking about.” 
Timilsina assumed the role of the speaker/chair of the National Assembly after the establishment of the Federal Democratic Republic. He had the opportunity to establish the system and the dignity of the National Assembly. However, instead of setting a positive example, he will soon be retiring after being accused of playing tricks with the Speaker and showing interest in the work of the House of Representatives.
Timilsina has repeatedly commented on the affairs of the House of Representatives. The latest instance was during a seminar on ‘Japan: Past, Present, and Future’ held in the capital on December 2, 2023, he publicly stated that the election results of the House of Representatives did not bode well.
Pointing to the emergence of a new party and the victory of some independent candidates, he said, “In a democracy, you get to choose candidates, irrespective of their party affiliation. However, is the signal positive?”
In August/ September 2022, Timilsina wrote a letter to the Election Commission, urging them to extend the tenure of Speaker and Deputy Speaker. Upon receiving a response stating that the Commission would not determine the tenure of the elected Parliament, Timilsina directed the Parliament Secretariat not to execute decisions made by the Management Committee after September 17, 2022.
This created conflict between the Speaker of the House of Representatives and the Speaker of the National Assembly and in the crux of this dispute between the parties, the country had to bear the consequences of this conflict. Laws could not be enacted promptly, and the place once considered the domain of experts was overshadowed by the party’s interest. 
A study conducted by the Democracy Resource Center Nepal (DRCN) on the legislative functioning of the National Assembly has revealed that the Upper House has passed some bills that go against the spirit of federalism.
The report’s concluding remarks say, “…the bills passed by the House of Representatives have not undergone significant changes or discussions in the National Assembly. The conclusion section of the study states that – “Furthermore, some bills, contradicting the spirit of federalism and addressing the interests of interest groups, have been approved by the National Assembly.”
Overall, in the last six years, parties have introduced individuals who, given their presentation level, have raised questions about the National Assembly’s justification. If there are no changes in the constitution, laws, and policies concerning the upper assembly, these concerns will persist.”"

While most of the nation was preparing for the festival of lights, Tihar in early November 2023, something no less exciting was fuelling our sparks from oceans away. A queer art festival was happening for the seventeenth year and we had a chance to attend it as delegates. Our delegation was made possible through the collaboration between the Outburst Arts, an art organisation based in Northern Ireland, UK and the British Council, Nepal.
There is a clear distinction between cities in terms of their flourishing arts scenes, and this became apparent during a visit to Belfast, Northern Ireland, specifically for the Outburst Queer Arts Festival held in the charming city centre. The organisation of such a festival requires months of careful preparation and planning.
The queer art festival started as short events lasting a few days. Now, after 17 years, it has grown into a ten-day festival with panel discussions, theatre performances, and exhibitions. Program guides were available at venues, partner hotels, local libraries, and shops. Many delegates, including us, came from outside Northern Ireland to attend.
During the queer art festival, we had the opportunity to connect with art curators, publishers, artists, and representatives from other British Council departments around the world (Lithuania, France, South Africa, Turkey, Greece, Jordan, England, and Argentina to name a few.) 
Each event that we attended gave us a different insight into what the arts can do and how it can facilitate connections. We gained insights from queer publishers and art curators on the challenges they face in their own countries due to resources and sometimes from bureaucracy in systems. We also got to see the way people can thrive when given a platform to showcase their works, such as an art exhibition in which the artist reimagined intimacy for queer people.
On the other hand, Nepal struggles by and large at times for queer visibility. There are no explicit spaces for SOGIESC (Sexual Orientation, Gender Identity and Expressions and Sex Characteristics) artists to showcase their works nor openly come together as a community, it all exists in pocket spaces. In the same way, something that struck us was the presence of older queer artists at the festival. 
It was not just for one particular event during the queer art festival. We noticed an active participation and involvement of older queer people throughout the festival there. It was fascinating to see queer artists in their 40s and 50s share their transformative and inspiring work. Whereas, back home, the queer folks at the forefront of queer art, advocacy and activism are mostly Gen-Zs and millennials. We have very few queer elders that we can count on our fingers who are diligently working for Nepali queer folks. Even among them, some still hold onto archaic notions and refuse to evolve and embrace changes. So, there’s that.
From dream to reality

Before being selected as delegates, both of us joined online meetings with British Council Nepal and the Outburst representatives facilitated through Kaalo 101 (an art space in Patan), along with interested queer artists from Nepal. We had a total of three meetings where we discussed the possibilities and challenges of doing a queer art festival in Nepal. 
The discourse also entailed us sharing a presentation about the updates of the queer art scene in Nepal in the last five years. The updates included memorable leaps taken in queer arts from music to literature and fashion and more by artists from diverse walks of life. Days after the third meeting, the British Council extended invitations to us to attend the Outburst Queer Arts Festival.
Our delegation is just one example of the transcontinental collaboration because it was something that happened for the first time and involved us. But, Outburst Arts and the British Council have been practising cross-continental collaboration for years. Even in this year’s festival, we witnessed a lot of artists from different continents work together in exhibitions, lectures, panel discussions, magazines and so on. The amalgamation introduced us to brilliant thought-provoking work that defies gender and sociopolitical norms. The power of transcontinental collaboration was beyond beautiful.
Imagining queer arts in Nepal

The queer art scene in Nepal is an emerging one. While a full-fledged festival may not be possible now, something small yet significant is achievable. Time and again, different organisations have been running large art exhibitions/tours for weeks and months. However, in the microcosm that is Nepal, especially Kathmandu, the capital is no stranger to art-oriented programs. What it has been unfamiliar with precisely is queer art. And the unfamiliarity is not something induced by the lack of queer artists and their art. Sadly, it is because of inadequate platforms, space and resources to pursue queer arts.
Despite this, through the years there have been events and literature that have emerged centring on queer identity, but it has not come without its challenges. On collections of stories, “Pride Climbing Higher” and “Songs of Revolution” showcase stories from Nepalis across Nepal. There are not many stories reflecting the Nepali queer experiences otherwise. 
June Pride Parade by Queer Youth Group has gained momentum as well in the past few years since its conception, from a small gathering to now a large parade with performances from community members. The same can be said about Blue Diamond Society’s (BDS) Rainbow Visibility Pride events in August during the festival of Saa-Paru (Gai Jatra) which has been running for well over a decade; in recent years they have included flash mobs and interaction programmes as well in lead up to their parade. Individuals within the community have also organised their queer gatherings with friends, thus coming back to the cosmos of pocket spaces in celebrating queerness.
While artists like us are creative with what we want to put out, we still need organisations like the British Council to foster spaces and connections to enable us to do that. Then and again, artists have come together and collaborated on queer-centric projects. But, we need funding and resources to achieve bigger-scale projects that unite more artists and transcend borders.
Both of us advocate for queer rights and are involved in programs and activities that push the narrative further, extend the visibility of the community and normalise conversations surrounding queerness. Among other things, we are also the founders of Queering The Bond, a networking collective for Nepali queer folks and Shuby is also the founder of Queer Honky-Tonk, a platform to promote queer performances and networking with events such as a drag show or open mic every few months. However, both of us, individually or collaboratively can only do so much. 

The challenges of living in a capitalistic world oftentimes outweigh the passion we have for the queer art scene in Nepal. And this is where we expect the government and organisations to step up with policies, platforms and programs to provide spaces, opportunities and resources for queer artists. Here, the British Council joined hands with Outburst Arts, which paved the way for our delegation. We would not have known about the marvellous queer art festival at the other end of the world otherwise.
Besides the limitations brought by insufficient spaces and social unawareness, the centralised capital does hinder queer artists from outside the city to connect, create and collaborate. Art already is centralised and elitist. On top of that, the concentrated Kathmandu Valley is of no help when it comes to making art accessible beyond its borders.
Furthermore, there is also the expectation from basically everyone to have the perfect festival that caters to all people’s needs and wants. While the festival, if it should happen, is bound to be done with the right intentions, there is a lot of pressure for the first-time event itself. The festival will be inclusive and diverse. But, realistically speaking, it would be a struggle to make it relevant to each queer person from east to west.
Speaking of struggles, a visceral feeling of uneasiness swarmed over me with each step I took while exiting the airport after the flight back home. I, Birat, personally felt that I could not be as free or unrestrained in Nepal as I was during my time in Belfast. No wonder a lot of the queer people we know opt for abroad.
Seventeen years ago, when the Outburst Queer Arts Festival first began, it certainly was not as celebrated or large as it is now. What we are trying to convey here is that we do not have to start big. We can aim for something small yet promising. While there might be expectations to check all the boxes, it is crucial to be mindful of our capacity as well. But, we can be capacitated and this is where you – people in power, art enthusiasts, grant and resource allocators and media come in. It is time we all believe in Nepali queer art and create space for it to not only survive but thrive. It is imperative to understand that formulating our imagination into reality can only be possible through unwavering collaboration."

Priyam Pradhan explores the essence of money and life in ‘Mani’ 
","The month of January saw major road accidents in different parts of the country, including Lamhi in Dang, Dhorpatan in Baglung, and Chandragiri in Kathmandu. Road accidents have been common throughout the country with Nepal Police data suggesting over 2,500 people dying in them annually. Despite this, the Ministry of Finance has shown reluctance to introduce the proposed Road Safety Bill to reduce traffic accidents, fatalities, and serious injuries, and enhance road safety. 
Instead, the Finance Ministry has asked the Ministry of Physical Infrastructure and Transport to include the proposed bill in the Public Roads Act. Along with that, the government’s initiative to pass dedicated laws on road safety and set up a mechanism, including the empowered National Road Safety Council (NRSC), to decrease accidents, has come to a halt.
Keshav Kumar Sharma, secretary of the Ministry of Physical Infrastructure and Transport, says they asked for a dedicated road safety law that comprehensively addresses institutional arrangements was the need of the hour. This includes ensuring safety in road construction, promoting public awareness, providing training and communication facilities, implementing rescue mechanisms, and arranging rehabilitation for families affected by road accidents. However, the Ministry of Finance believes a separate law is unnecessary due to concerns about potential increased financial burden.
Hourly need

Officials from the Ministry of Physical Infrastructure allege that the Ministry of Finance is approaching sensitive matters, such as passenger safety, solely from an economic standpoint. They say that concerns related to road, vehicle, and passenger safety are being overshadowed, and there are indications that this approach will continue. 
“The government is avoiding addressing the sensitive issue of road accidents and the associated human and material costs, fearing an increase in expenses. This contradicts the government’s commitment and policy to reduce traffic accidents in the future,” says an official from the Ministry of Physical Infrastructure on the condition of anonymity.
According to the Ministry of Physical Infrastructure, the existing laws lack the vision and purpose necessary for developing a sustainable, safe, risk-free, and reliable transportation operation and security system. Therefore, the Ministry of Physical Infrastructure officials argue that a distinct law is essential to decrease road accidents and ensure the safety of pedestrians, including passenger transport workers and roadside residents, as well as pets, wild animals, and birds. 
“The Road Safety Act is the need of the hour as it will help us during post-accident rescue, treatment management, rehabilitation, and legal representation,” says the official.
Currently, there are gaps in enforcing road rules, monitoring vehicle capacities, ensuring road structure safety, managing traffic signs, and organizing road safety facilities. The implementation of the Road Safety Act is seen as crucial to address these issues.
However, there has not been a facilitative environment for providing education and raising awareness about road traffic safety, safety mechanisms, and coordinating among organisations related to road transport. The aspect of training drivers with skills and knowledge, as well as monitoring road safety on the roads, is also lacking. This is why experts have been suggesting introducing a separate road safety law to address these aspects.
The Finance Ministry, however, says that road safety should not be downplayed by ignoring human sensibilities related to road safety and citing economic reasons. Officials from the Ministry of Physical Infrastructure argue that incorporating safety considerations in the Road Act does not automatically result in a decrease in accidents or the integration of post-accident rescue, relief, and rehabilitation efforts.
“The existing laws do not address road safety anywhere. Due to its lack of clarity and inadequacy, it has not been implemented with due diligence. For instance, provisions such as those for vehicle inspectors outlined in the Transport Act have not been acted upon by the government,” says an official from the Transport Ministry.
Policies and commitments, but no laws

The Motor Vehicles and Transport Management Act (1993) includes several provisions related to vehicle registration, road permits, driver’s licenses, traffic management, insurance, and penalties. The Public Roads Act (1974) primarily focuses on road management. However, there is no provision in the Act regarding the National Road Safety Council.
In this situation, Nepal has developed a 10-year road safety action plan but is yet to enact corresponding legislation. Unfortunately, government agencies and mechanisms are not obligated to follow the action plan, as it lacks legal guidance.
Now, the Transport Ministry holds the view that if safety considerations are explicitly addressed in the Public Roads Act, the outcome will not differ from what the Finance Ministry has said. Given the Public Roads Act’s close association with the Department of Road, the ministry thinks greater emphasis will be placed on road construction. However, they argue that incorporating the road safety aspect into the Act would not be effective.
Secretary Sharma of the Transport Ministry is tasked with ensuring road safety, overseeing physical infrastructure and transport, and coordinating efforts across education, health, home, law, federal affairs, and general administration ministries. This responsibility extends to provincial ministries, local levels, as well as various agencies, organisations, security agencies, non-governmental organisations, and related entities, each with their specific roles.
“As all the agencies need to be allocated responsibilities for various aspects of road safety, we have requested them to collaborate in formulating a distinct law. This should encompass the reduction of all types of accidents,” said Sharma.
The ministry believes that a dedicated law addressing road safety is crucial to mitigate severe road accidents in Nepal and to uphold the commitments made by the country on the international stage.
Nepal has committed to implementing the Stockholm Declaration through the Global Road Traffic Safety Conference in 2020, as per the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. Nepal, which has incorporated sustainable development goals into its national development plan, has not yet commenced work aligned with these objectives.

Nevertheless, Nepal’s neighbouring countries are already addressing road safety through legal frameworks. Various states in India have enacted road safety laws, and the effectiveness of these laws is contributing to a 50 per cent reduction in road accidents.
In 1999, Bhutan also introduced a unified road safety and transport act. Pakistan, on the other hand, issued the National Highway Safety Ordinance-2000 to ensure road safety, distinct from its National Highway Authority Act (1991). Britain, Australia, America, New Zealand, and other countries have established separate road safety laws as well.
Road safety neglected
In Nepal, road safety has been consistently neglected due to the absence of dedicated legislation. Road safety expert Keshav Adhikari says that the government primarily focused on road construction, overlooks crucial aspects such as road safety and reinforcement. Consequently, roads are transforming into perilous pathways for both vehicles and passengers.
“There is a lack of interest in formulating policies and laws aimed at mitigating financial losses resulting from accidents,” says Adhikari.
He further points out that safety is not a governmental priority, as expanding the road network is perceived to yield more political benefits than implementing additional structures to enhance road safety.
“When I worked as an expert in the Transport Ministry for over a year, I realised that promoting road safety is not a government priority,” he says. “Annually, more people die due to road accidents than those who die in natural disasters, but the government has not given it much attention.”
Even though the prime minister, ministers, and MPs keep asserting that roads have been constructed, no one seems to be addressing the critical issues of road safety and quality.
Saroj Sitaula, General Secretary of the Federation of Nepalese National Transport Entrepreneurs (FNNTE), says that the government must be attentive as accidents are on the rise due to various technical and human factors, including road infrastructure. 
“Many accidents can be mitigated by improving road conditions, installing barriers on the sides, putting up informational boards, and ensuring scientific and practical road markings,” he says. “We need to formulate a plan and progress accordingly.”
Sitaula argues that the government should establish policies to create mechanisms for emergency rescue, treatment, and rehabilitation after an accident occurs. He emphasises the importance of enhancing road infrastructure, conducting a scientific examination of the technical condition of vehicles, and ensuring compliance with the law by drivers, passengers, and regulators. He says that blaming drivers and transport entrepreneurs for accidents is inadequate, and the government must fulfil its responsibilities.
Roads are unsafe

Nepal currently boasts a road network spanning approximately 100,000 km, with the majority consisting of dirt and gravel roads. Among the more than 22,000 kilometres of national and subsidiary highways, numerous sections remain unpaved.
Despite the government’s substantial investment in road construction and expansion, minimal efforts are allocated to ensuring road safety. 
Recently, all three levels of government have accelerated the widening of roads, incorporating asphalt and slopes. However, it appears that issues concerning road quality and safety are escalating at a faster pace. Roads that have been neglected in the guise of maintenance have become a nightmare for the public.
Infrastructure expert Suryaraj Acharya notes that these problems arise due to the tendency to construct roads only after they have sustained damage, without considering potential issues during the initial construction phase."

The series includes the Realme 12 Pro 5G and the Realme 12 Pro+ 5G which are the successors of the Realme 11 Pro+ 5G and Realme 11 Pro 5G respectively. The Realme 11 series was widely appreciated for its design and performance at the price range. 
The 12 series has stepped up the game with an even better design. Realme has not only changed the design but has also upgraded the performance and the camera to compete in the mid-range price market. Realme recently has been focusing a lot on the design aspect and the price range performance. 
The 12 Pro+ has some major differences from last year’s 11 Pro+ which include design, IP rating, chipset, camera and charging. 
Let us see what the luxuriously designed smartphone delivers in terms of specs.

Design and Display
The Realme 12 Pro+ and the Realme 12 Pro share the same design and dimensions. The design is fascinating. Realme patterned up with Luxury Swiss Watch designer Ollivier Savéo to craftfully design the smartphone. 
All the colour options have a vegan leather back. Since the phone is designed by a luxury watch designer, it comes with a big round camera module housing the triple camera setup. There is a golden 3D Jubilee Bracelet which gives the texture of a luxury watch strap. A golden patterned line runs through the middle and around the camera module for an even better look.

Santoshi Shrestha wins gold on marathon debut 
","Ram Bujhaun Yadav with his land ownership certificate stands near a border pillar which he says was erroneously placed on his land. 
In October 2023, when 51-year-old Ram Bujhaun Yadav of Musaharnia Rural Municipality-5, Mukhiyapatti, Dhanusha, was at a relative’s house, someone told him that two Indian Sashastra Seema Bal (SSB) personnel were looking for him.
Anxious, he rushed home wondering why they were looking for him.
“They asked me if the paddy field in the no man’s land was mine. I told them yes and they asked me to cut down the paddy immediately,” he said.
The paddy was not ripe and Yadav asked them for some time. However, the SSB personnel told him he had to cut down his paddy immediately.
Ram Bujhaun and his wife Tetari Devi each own a 677-square-metre plot of land. As Nepal and India reevaluated the border, Ram Bujhan’s land was been deemed to be near the no man’s land as it now has two demarcation pillars.
Frustrated, Ram Bujhaun cut the paddy before it was due to be harvested. Now, he has been asked to not plant anything on the land as it falls in the no man’s land.
“Our border police don’t say a word. I can’t fight the SSB on my own,” says Ram Bujhaun adding he had decided not to plan anything on the land anymore.
Woes of the farmers
Many farmers in southern Nepal say their land has now been placed in India after the recent demarcation. 
When the Jamuna River, which flows through the no man’s land between Nepal and India, changed its course some two decades ago, some border pillars went missing. Locals say these pillars have now been placed encroaching on Nepali land.
In 2018, with the then Chief District Officer of Dhanusha, Pradeep Raj Kandel, and an official from Madhubani district, Bihar, India, a team that included border security forces from both countries, the Armed Police Force of Nepal, and SSB of India began placing border pillars after land measurement by technicians.
Locals have raised concerns, stating that border pillars have been positioned, encroaching approximately 50 to 100 meters of land into Nepal compared to the previous position. Many like Ram Bujhaun are unaware of when these border pillars were placed.
“I did not know that pillar was placed here. After I found out when I asked the village leaders, many said they were placing the border pillars as they pleased,” said Ram Bujhaun.
He was told to carry on planting paddy and that it would not matter as these issues had happened in the past. 
“They encroached on my land and have asked me not to plant anything. This is gross injustice,” he says.
Ram Bujhaun’s family owns a total of 4,000 square metres of land, with 2,000 square metres belonging to him and the remaining 2,000 square metres to his brother Bechan. However, 1,000 square metres of his land is now located on the Indian side after the demarcation. Despite this, he has been farming on the land and continues to pay taxes to the Department of Land Management and Archive in Nepal.
“They have marked my land to be on the Indian side and placed border pillars on it. I’ve been farming till now but I don’t know when they will ask me to stop,” he says.
Ignorance of the government
The Madhesh province in southern Nepal
The former ward chair of Mukhiyapatti Musharniya Rural Municipality-5, Ram Naresh Yadav, said that over time, India has encroached on numerous Nepali lands in various locations in the Madhesh Province. This, he says, happened due to the Nepali administration’s ignorance and weak stature.
“They (Nepali administration) were careless and that meant the Indian side placed these border pillars by encroaching on Nepali land,” says Ram Naresh.
He said that over 40 farmers from wards 1, 5, and 6 have land ranging from 300 to 1,600 square metres on the Indian side. 
“These farmers have land ownership certificates, but they cannot farm as the SSB says the land is in India and not Nepal,” said Ram Naresh.
In 1996, land ownership certificates were distributed after surveying the land in the border area. Local Dharmendra Kumar Yadav said that since then, the locals have been paying their land tax regularly. In 2018, when the pillar was being placed, the locals protested when they saw their land was being encroached on. However, since the demarcation had been agreed upon by high-ranking government officials of Nepal and India, the farmer’s voices went unheard.
“We tried to stop when the border pillars were being placed on our land. But the administrators from both sides forcibly put it there without even trying to hold a discussion,” said Harish Chandra Yadav. 
The Chief District Officer of Dhanusha, Chakrapani Pandey, says that the border pillars were placed by the technical team after the measurements and with the agreement of the high-ranking officials of the two countries.
“The fields and houses that are built in no man’s land have recently been cleared. No one can do anything in this particular area,” said Pandey. “We understand the people’s concern but we cannot do anything about it now.”"

Erroneous border pillar placement plagues Nepali farmers in Madhesh

Life is filled with surprises and unexpected events and it can change at any moment. The only thing certain in life is the uncertainty. Change is a natural and inevitable part of our lives, and it may be positive as well as negative.
Even though it is not guaranteed that we will wake up in the morning, we set the alarm every night with the hope that we will wake up in the morning. We do not know what each day is going to bring us, but we may have varieties, adventures, and endless opportunities.
The push to explore
The uncertainty sometimes forces us to explore those aspects of life, we never knew existed or needed. It also tests the mental strength of people and how they deal with it. The uncertainty has taught me to be grateful, as we never know what life throws at us.
In life, everything does not go according to our plans, and if we do not embrace the change we will face huge trouble. The Covid-19 pandemic is the best example of uncertainty, we were constantly fearing death and it was uncertain that we would see the sunrise the next day.
It is not certain that every decision in life will be correct, but if you fear not trying at all, you miss endless opportunities for learning and growing. When our decisions or outcomes are on the negative side, we get depressed and we might tend to think about committing suicide, but we forget that if we have life we have endless opportunities. 
Most of us plan for our careers, our love life, etc. and when those plans do not work out we start getting uncomfortable. But if we can deal with today, we can surely deal with tomorrow. We need to cherish little moments in our lives and know that nothing is permanent not even the failures and setbacks.
We come here with nothing and leave with nothing. So why should we hold the egos and grudges against each other? Instead of making our life meaningful and enjoying the journey of life, we get into puzzles of accumulating wealth and we go against our own loved ones for it. 
Change is certain

Nothing is permanent in life, everything can change in fractions of seconds. In today’s society, everyone is so busy, that we people have so less time for our loved ones. What I have learned over the years, is to find time in our busy schedule for our family because we never know when it will be our last day together with them. 
Yes! Death is a natural process, so if you have to die someday, why should you die with grudges in your heart? But instead of worrying about the inevitable, focusing on the things you can control will bring a lot of happiness in life.
Uncertainty is not only a negative thing; it also brings a lot of opportunity because you dare to change. The life-changing experience will not come knocking down your door, you need to expose yourself. We learn by doing and experimenting, even though we might fail. But that is not the end of the world. I still remember hesitating while applying for the role of leadership, at my school level as it was not certain that I would be chosen.
Even after being selected, I was uncertain about whether I could fulfil my responsibilities or not. But that uncertainty helped me grow out of my comfort zone and give my best input. If I had not applied for that role just because I was uncertain of the outcome, I would miss the biggest learning opportunity in my school life. So, do not let the uncertainty or the unknown ever stop you from trying and no matter how much we try, to plan life always finds a way to surprise us. 
It is important to stay grounded when we have everything we wish for because life can take such a turn that we had never expected in our wildest dreams. Similarly, nothing is permanent in life, the financial hardships, the grades, the breakups, etc. But the most important thing is not to lose hope during those difficult times.
According to the data provided by Nepal police, around 6,830 people took their lives in the fiscal year 2022/23. There is nothing in life that cannot be resolved although it may take time, committing suicide should not be an option. It’s important to share feelings among family members or loved ones because together as a family any problem can be overcome.
Embrace the unknown and focus on enhancing your life, instead of worrying about what will happen next. Always find time for your loved ones, as life is uncertain. We should be grateful that we are alive and accept that change is the only constant thing in life. Do not let the unknown, stop you from trying or achieving your goals and always remember that even if you fail, you still have endless opportunities."

Regenerative Braking in EVs: Advantages, Disadvantages and Common Misconceptions

Kathmandu, September 5
India have knocked Nepal out of the Asia Cup in a rain-affected match in Pallekele on Monday.
Asking Nepal to bat first, India did not take advantage of the chances that came their way dropping three catches in the first five overs. Taking advantage of that, Nepali openers, Kushal Bhurtel and Aasif Sheikh played shots riding their luck at times as they put up a 65-run opening stand.
The rest of the batters, however, could not take advantage of the start. Bhim Sharki, Rohit Paudel and Kushal Malla all threw their wicket away by playing poor shots. Gulshan Jha soon followed them to the pavilion as Nepal had no answer for the spin bowling of Ravindra Jadeja and Kuldeep Yadav.
When Sheikh got out for 58 in the 30th over, it looked like Nepal would be bowled out for less than 200. However, a valiant innings from Dipendra Singh Airee and Sompal Kami took the score past 200 and Nepal were bowled out for 230, a major improvement from their last game against Pakistan in Multan.
In reply, India were tested in the first over when Karan KC challenged Rohit Sharma. However, the team were soon shown how far behind they are by Sharma and Shubman Gill who hit the ballers all over the park. The game was shorted due to rain with India needing 145 to win in 23 overs.
That did not affect the Indian batters as they reached their with ease with 17 balls to spare.
With this loss, Nepal’s first participation in the Asia Cup has been a bittersweet one. Even though former international players have heaped praise, the players will leave Sri Lanka with a feeling of what if as they push on to play with the big boys again."

Winning the toss, Pakistan chose to bat first on a hot day in Multal. Even though Nepal got two quick wickets after Karan KC sent back Fakhar Zaman and Imam-ul-Haq was run out by captain Rohit Paudel.
Things, however, started to go down afterwards as Pakistan’s captain Babar Azam anchored the innings with Mohammad Rizwan and then with Iftikhar Ahmed.

Nepal beat Kuwait by 34 runs in the ongoing T20I Women’s Quadrangular Series being held in Malaysia.
An all-round performance by Indu Barma helped Nepal notch up their second win of the series. Nepal beat Hong Kong by six wickets on Tuesday.
Kuwait won the toss and put Nepal to bat first. The Nepali batters struggled to get going in what looked like a slowish wicket. Nepal’s opening woes continued as Puja Mahato was out the second ball of the innings. Bindu Rawal, even though stuck through as an anchor, had a difficult time on the wickets. While she held one end, other batters kept throwing their wickets as Nepal were 56 for seven.
An explosive 23 of 19 balls from Barma, however, helped Nepal to what looked like a below-par score of 89.
In reply, the Kuwaiti women also struggled as they did not get going at all. The Nepali bowlers continued to pile on the pressure and kept taking wickets at regular intervals to win the match by 34 runs as the Kuwait women could only score 55 runs in 20 overs losing eight wickets.
Barma was impressive with the ball picking up three wickets.

Women’s T20 World Cup Asia Qualifier: Nepal reach semi-final after easy win against Qatar

Kathmandu, August 23 
The men’s national cricket team has left for Pakistan to take part in the Asia Cup that will begin on August 30.
The team is going to take part in its toughest test yet as they will take on Asian giants Pakistan and India. 
While many say this will be good exposure for the national team, captain Rohit Paudel believes that they have had enough exposure and it was now time to compete with the best in the world.
“It is going to be tough, but I believe if we apply ourselves well we can compete with India and Pakistan,” Paudel told Onlinekhabar.
The results in the Emerging Team’s Asia Cup, however, do not paint a bright picture as Nepal were humbled by both Pakistan A and India A.
Despite that, the team is upbeat as Paudel says this is a time to play great and put Nepali cricket on the world map as they gear up to play India and Pakistan for the first time.
“The entire cricketing world watches Pakistan and India’s matches. So this is a chance for us to announce ourselves. We are very excited,” said Paudel.
The team however showed a lot of weakness during the World Cup Qualifiers especially when it came to short-pitch deliveries. Paudel says they are ready to face the short deliveries and have prepared accordingly.
“We know they will test us with the short stuff and we have done whatever we could to prepare for what is to come,” said Paudel.
Coach Monty Desai believes the team has a winning spirit and says it is a chance for this young team to create history.
“It is a challenge but it is also an opportunity. We will give 100 per cent as always,” said Desai.
Rape-accused cricketer Sandeep Lamichhane is currently ill, said Cricket Association of Nepal officials. It is unsure if he join the team due to his impending court case.
Nepal will face Pakistan on August 30 and India on September 4."

","Shreya Khadka 
On a hot summer day, Shreya Khadka and her teammates are training hard. Sweat drips down their face as they put in the work on the basketball court at Mamba Sports Center. It is hot and humid, but Khadka and her team are running around and doing various drills as they prepare to take part in the upcoming Asian Games 2023 that is going to be held in Hangzhou, China.
Khadka, 23, is the captain of Nepal’s basketball team that will represent Nepal in the 3×3 basketball in the Asian Games. She is the only member of the team who has played an international level 3×3 basketball tournament. Part of Nepal’s team that took part in the 2019 Asian Games, she knows how tough the opponents are going to be.
“This is only the third time we are taking part in the 3×3 basketball competition in Asian Games. We want to play well and win at least one game this year,” Khadka said.
Gearing up for Asian Games 
National women’s team practising for Asian Games, slated for September 
Shreya Khadka and the members of the national women’s team have been training for the past three months. They are taking part in at least 10 practice sessions a week. As the date for the tournament nears, the team feels confident as they have seen their performance get better over time.
Khadka knowns that they will need more than that to win games at the Asian Games.
“We did not win a single game in 2019 but I realised what it takes to win. We were not physical enough and this time have worked on it,” she said. “Another important takeaway from the tournament was that height does not matter.”
Although she acknowledges the significant role that height plays in basketball, she holds the belief that the assumption that tall players are inherently skilled is false.
“It’s all about skills and strength and we are working on it,” she said.
To get stronger and compete physically with the rest of Asia, the team has been powerlifting and playing against men.
“We’ve also been eating right,” Khadka said.
Lingering challenges
Shreya Khadka will be accompanied by Garisha Silwal, Mina Gurung and Rinchen Moktan in the national team. 
The team is showing an unwavering commitment to the tournament. However, the team says they are facing various challenges and one of those is the lack of consistent and effective training sessions 
What has not helped the team is they do not have a dedicated practice facility and are instead making use of rented spaces at two locations: Surya Sports Centre in Dhumbarahi and Mamba Sports Center in Buddhanagar. 
The disadvantage of relying on rented venues is that their practice schedules are dependent on court availability, and furthermore, these courts lack the necessary training equipment and resources.
Moreover, the format of a 3×3 basketball tournament is also comparatively different from a full-court basketball tournament. That is another challenge for Shreya Khadka and her team. In contrast to a conventional basketball game, the team’s coach will not be present next to them. Instead, the coach is required to occupy a seat in the audience and is prohibited from providing any form of verbal or symbolic instructions.
This is where Khadka’s leadership skills as captain come in.
“As a captain, I have to do a lot. I am not just supposed to play the game. I also have to maintain communication and coordination and take decisions of what play to run and when,” said Khadka. “I know this is going to be tough.”
Khadka will be accompanied by Garisha Silwal, Mina Gurung and Rinchen Moktan in the national team. Silwal and Gurung have already played with Khadka in the national women’s basketball. Silwal and Gurung won bronze medals in the 3×3 basketball tournament during the 13th South Asian Games (SAG), held in 2019 in Nepal. 
Knowing the captain
Shreya Khadka 
Shreya Khadka has been playing for the national team since her school days. She made her national team debut at just 16 years old during the 12th South Asian Games in 2016. Including age group tournaments, she has participated in a total of six international tournaments. Four years ago, Khadka was part of the Asian Games, where she played under the leadership of Anusha Malla.
But among all of them, the upcoming Asian Games is going to be the most important tournament for her life because of the role she has earned and it has made her excited.
“I have set a simple goal of winning one match. It is going to be tough but me and the team are going to give our all to fulfil this goal,” said Khadka.
While the goal might not feel huge to many, for the basketball team, it is massive. Nepal has not won a single match in the Asian Games so far and Shreya Khadka and her team want to change that.
“If we do that, we can then focus on the 14th South Asian Games where I want to win a gold medal,” she said.
Recognising the necessity for enhancing the current state of Nepali basketball, she emphasises the importance of implementing changes at a policy level.
“We only look at talents in Kathmandu. We need to take basketball away from the capital and look at players from across the country. Doing that will help improve the level,” she said.
Additionally, she hopes the national team can have its own dedicated basketball court where they can train anytime.
“These are small aspirations that can be achieved though planning nad hard work,” says Khadka."

Machhindra FC have qualified for the second preliminary round of the AFC Cup after beating Paro FC from Bhutan in the first preliminary round 3-2.
In what was a tightly contested game, Machhindra FC did not start the game well going behind in the seventh minute through an own goal from goalkeeper Bishal Shrestha. But the team rallied as Bimal Gharti Magar, Ayush Ghalan and Afeez Olawale Oladipo scored three quick goals giving Machhindra FC a comfortable lead heading to halftime.
It looked like it was going to be an easy win but Paro FC started the second half better controlling the game and putting pressure on Machhindra FC who looked tired in the last quarter of the game.

T20I Women’s Quadrangular Series: Nepal lose to hosts Malaysia
","Gyanendra Malla
After 17 long years playing for Nepal’s cricket team, Gyanendra Malla on August 4 announced he was retiring from international cricket. In the course of his career, the 32-year-old experienced a transformative journey, as he was part of a team that climbed their way from the ICC World Cricket League – Division 5 to attaining the coveted ODI status.
“I think the timing is right. I’ve given all that I could and when you’re not giving 100 per cent, I feel it was time to get away,” said Malla adding he will probably not play in domestic leagues either.
End of an era 
Malla was one of the last members of Nepal’s golden generation that did more than just win games. They entertained the Nepali audience and gave the fans the belief that anything is possible. Evidence of that is how they qualified for the T20 World Cup in Bangladesh inspiring a new generation of cricketers in the process.
That was not all, Gyanendra Malla along with his long-time captain Paras Khadka and Shakti Gauchan played an integral role in getting the coveted ODI status in 2018 to solidify their legacy in Nepali cricket. However, as Malla joins the ranks of Khadka and Gauchan in bidding farewell to his international career, it is safe to say that an era has come to a close.
“Their generation redefined cricket in Nepal. Players like Paras and Gyanendra are why the new generation dreamt of playing cricket. We were the first generation but I this team led by Paras and Gyanendra are the golden generation,” said Jagat Tamata. “I feel a little sad and emotional.”
However, Gyanendra Malla believes that the present moment is opportune for him to bid farewell. He believes that the cricket team is on a positive trajectory and having devoted his utmost, he now desires to step back and relish the experience of observing the team in action.
The journey has not been as rosy though. After Khadka resigned, Malla took over the captaincy of the team. The team, which was under transition, did not do well and he only managed to win 15 games out of 32.
Things took an ugly turn in 2021 when he was suspended as captain and removed from the team by CAN President Chatur Bahadur Chand following a dispute over the grading of players in the central contract.
The decision to suspend Gyanendra Malla and vice-captain Dipendra Singh Airee was met with resistance from a number of individuals who questioned the reasoning behind it. The environment became tense, with the team teetering on the brink of factionalism. 
However, the situation eventually calmed down, leading to Malla’s eventual reinstatement in the national team. Malla felt he felt he owed it to the young players to demonstrate his selflessness and leadership qualities again.
Following his return, Nepal went on a series of wins under the leadership of Rohit Paudel retaining the ODI status, playing in the World Cup Qualifier in Zimbabwe and qualifying for the Asia Cup.
“Everything is going great. I wish the team the best of luck,” he says.
A young man’s dream

Born in Bhimsensthan in Kathmandu, Gyanendra Malla started his cricketing journey in 2005 during the Asia U15 Cup. In that very year, he secured a spot in both the U17 and U19 teams. He was part of Nepal’s U19 team that went on win the Plate Cup in the U19 World Cup beating New Zealand in the final.
This performance in the tournament landed him a place in the national team as he made his senior debut in 2006 in a 4-day match against Namibia in the ICC Intercontinental Cup qualifier in Windhoek.

In 2012, at the ACC Trophy Elite held in Saudi Arabia, Gyanendra Malla delivered a standout performance by scoring a 17-ball half-century. Over the course of the tournament, he accumulated a total of 212 runs, including two half-centuries, playing a pivotal role in Nepal reaching the final and sharing trophy with the UAE.
However, as he retires he might carry a tinge of disappointment he never made big runs for Nepal. Fans often say that he fell short of meeting the lofty expectations placed upon him, a notion he does not shy away from acknowledging. 
“I don’t know why I was not able to score big runs,” he says.
Gyanendra Malla, who embraces his identity as a cricketer, cherishes the T20 World Cup in Bangladesh as his most memorable experience. However, not being able to participate in tests and the ODI World Cup leaves a sense of unfulfillment in his career aspirations. 
“I hope the younger generation can fulfil our dream,” he says.
Over the past year, Malla found himself as the sole seasoned cricketer amidst a lineup predominantly composed of younger players. Once suspended from the captaincy, he transitioned into a mentor figure, offering valuable guidance and support to his teammates.
According to the younger players, Malla held a crucial role within the national team, effectively managing the squad and providing them with valuable guidance and mentorship.
Rohit Kumar Paudel, captain of the national team, has also appreciated Malla’s contribution through a social media post. 
“From leading the team to glorious victories to setting an example of dedication, guiding us through highs and lows, it’s been an incredible journey,” writes Paudel. “The selflessness, sacrifices, and invaluable support you’ve extended to me is priceless.”
Similarly, his longtime captain and friend Khadka calls him a champion cricketer, a resilient warrior, and an exceptional teammate.
“Congratulations, Gyanu for serving the nation with utmost pride, grace and most importantly putting in all the effort for years and years with dedication, consistency and selflessness,” writes Khakda on Facebook.  “It was an honour and a privilege to share the dressing room with you and the memories that we carry through years of seeing Nepali cricket and cricketers grow will never fade away.”
An international cricketer has taken to social media to pay tribute to Malla upon his retirement. In an appreciation post, Rohan Mustafa, a cricketer from the UAE, commends Malla, stating, “Your impact on Nepali cricket will always be remembered. Beyond being a player, you are a remarkable individual.”"

","As untouched and less discussed as the sports management industry is in Nepal, it has ample room to showcase creativity. Photo by Miguel Bruna on Unsplash
In 2023, Barbie named Women in Sports as their career of the year.
Whenever I am out and about socially, there is always someone who seems pretty certain about not considering my profession as mainstream. Hold up! Sports as a career? In Nepal? You bet! This article aims to explain why women in this male-dominant sports industry in Nepal should not be viewed as a surprise.
I have been part of the Nepali cricket industry in a private capacity for quite a while now. Armed with a Master’s Degree in IT from an American University, my choice to stick with sports management tends to raise eyebrows. While I am not an on-field player, I am definitely behind the scenes, playing strong games of serious deliverance with my team. We are all about creating what is not there.
As untouched and less discussed as the sports management industry is in Nepal, it has ample room to showcase creativity. Being a commanding woman in a position can be challenging, but on the brighter side, the gender advantage has yet to fail me. As alien as I might be in sports management in Nepal, I have been accepted with open arms. The nature of the job is highly competitive, no doubt.
Embraced by the sports fraternity

Women in sports are safe, heard, and welcomed. I absolutely relish the addition of spirited women to the team. The nuances of sports are something women complement greatly. Sports management inherently rejects narrow minds. There is a lot of travelling, meeting people, experimenting, and remembering limitations. The adjustments are both trivial and clever. 
Often, in our part of the world, societal norms limit women from making career decisions, hindering them from living life on their terms. This restriction potentially keeps many capable women from pursuing the sports industry, where they could truly wield their power to make an impact. Change is gradual, and I hope to see numerous female faces in charge of stadiums someday in Nepal.
Yes, there are challenges. It ranges from personal sacrifices to job security and opportunities. However, these are workable factors for any freelancer in sports management. The key is excelling at our jobs to thrive anywhere. 
Taking a page from the medical field, the seriousness we apply there should not differ in sports management. Sports is a powerful industry. Children grow up idolising what we showcase on TV. As glorious as the game is, it is every child’s dream to represent their country someday. Carrying that responsibility is our role in sports—an often thankless yet deeply satisfying job.
Nepali sports industry
The fans went wild at TU Cricket Ground after Nepal beat UAE.
Sports may be a smaller industry in Nepal, but globally, it is a behemoth. The world economy has shifted, and it is time we alter our perspective to recognise the potential of sports as an industry in Nepal. The idea of open commercialisation of sports remains somewhat unexplored, as it continues to be a more exclusive affair in Nepal. 
By sourcing innovative ideas, there’s a wealth of public attention and investment waiting to be tapped into, along with numerous practices to establish and discard. As the Nepali team achieves international records, the packaging of the sport becomes everything. There is plenty to learn from international sports management to make our industry highly marketable and poised for global entry.
Sports such as cricket, football, volleyball, or even golf serve as key intersections for reshaping Nepal’s global narrative. Over the years, Kabaddi has witnessed a substantial surge in India, both in terms of viewership and commercial success. The primary challenge we grapple with is Nepal’s comparatively small market size, posing constraints on our ability to generate substantial economic gains. Therefore, there is unanimous agreement on the imperative for Nepal’s sports to venture onto the international stage.
Nepal boasts many hardworking individuals, yet achieving this goal demands specialised talents in sports management with the requisite experience and the capacity to enhance existing values. In the long run, outsourcing such talents may foster dependence. Hence, a concerted effort is needed to inspire Nepali youth to engage in sports management, contributing to our sports ecosystem. 
There are various ways in which we can harness the potential of sports for our benefit. Encouraging youth involvement can be instrumental in capitalising on the multifaceted opportunities presented by the sports industry. There is a lot to explore if you think about it."

Asia Cup: Cricket team leaves for Pakistan to face their biggest test yet
","Painting ‘My Private Life’ by artist Priyam Pradhan at the exhibition Mani at Siddhartha Art Gallery, Baber Mahal. Photo: Chandra Bahadur Ale
Using Pitt’s artist pen on paper, artist Priyam Pradhan presents My Private Life, a showcase of the current significance of his life depicted in abstract form.
At the centre of the painting is a 1000-rupee note, within which Pradhan has intricately painted Lord Krishna, a man wearing a hoodie tenderly embracing his dog, and a woman. The woman stands tall, elongated in form. Towards the bottom of the canvas, a holy man reaches out his hands, appearing to be in flight.
Priyam Pradhan has used a vibrant colour palette, incorporating bright hues such as pink, orange, and yellow, as well as green, black, white, and grey. This combination adds a dynamic and lively quality to the artwork.
“The man in the centre is me and the girl in green is my girlfriend. And the faces are my mom and dad,” says Pradhan. “The sadhu (holy man) symbolises my desires that I don’t have many desires for materialistic things however I do understand the value of money.”
The use of colours, figures and lines in an abstract form in his painting resembles the painting of American painter Paul Jackson Pollock. Like his abstract expressionism, Pradhan has expressed himself in his painting.
Furthermore, this marks Priyam Pradhan’s third solo painting exhibition titled Mani (money), inaugurated on January 17 at Siddhartha Art Gallery, Baber Mahal.
In his previous exhibitions, Pradhan’s artworks centred around Hindu philosophy and his spontaneous thought process. However, in this latest exhibition, he explores the theme of money and its impact on an individual’s life, delving into the reverberating effects of financial aspects.
Understanding the value of money
Paintings by artist Priyam Pradhan at Siddhartha Art Gallery, Baber Mahal. Photo: Chandra Bahadur Ale

Any form of art is known as a reflection of the contemporary time. Likewise, Priyam Pradhan’s paintings reflect the lifestyle, desires, obligations and more of today’s younger generation living in urban areas in Nepal.
Pradhan himself is in his 20s and he has justified the want of most of the youngsters in their 20s, who might be declared adults and understand the need for money and materialistic things but are still kids at their heart who want to explore and experience life as much as possible.
The exhibition has 27 paintings which Pradhan took around nine months to complete. According to him, while he was travelling the idea that his life was luxurious and him being capable of exploring anything he wanted to was because of money.
And being an artist this concept lingered on him and he was compelled to create on the theme of money.
Once you enter the gallery, you can also view an animated video, which introduces artist Pradhan and the importance of money, which is on the ground floor. On the first floor, a huge painting (193×62 in cm) Apatkalin Awastha using mixed media on canvas welcomes you and other paintings are small in size (18×30 in cm).
“It is a team work and it is my introduction as an artist for the exhibition,” he says. “Also, being a recent multimedia graduate from Islington College, I wanted to explore my skills and I got my team. Then, like money, multimedia is relevant to current society.”
Experiencing life through art
Painting by artist Priyam Pradhan at Siddhartha Art Gallery, Baber Mahal. Photo: Chandra Bahadur Ale 
Priyam Pradhan says enjoyment is the meaning of life and he enjoys creating artwork. Moreover, Pradhan who came into the art world first being a tattoo artist feels blessed that he has the privilege to explore whatever he likes in his life.
He also believes that the philosophy that says one should not be materialistic is wrong. “If material things are not important, why would one build a house? And after building a house why do they want to decorate their house?” he questions.
Alongside, money and materialistic things, his paintings also explore love, romance, life and childhood experiences. Motifs like Pokemon, ramen noodles, animals, dancers, etc have been used in his paintings. In most of his paintings, he has used numerous white lines in wavy form and these lines for Pradhan indicate the sound or the energy that exists in the surroundings all the time.
About using a pitta artist pen, he says, “I have enjoyed drawing and painting since my childhood and using a pitta artist pen helps me revisit that feeling of happiness and sense of freedom.”
So many things happening on the canvas with the use of vibrant colours gives a sense of excitement to the viewers. Though referencing artists like Pollock, MF Husain, Picasso and more, his pen strokes give a sense of newness through his expression and thoughts about his life experiences.
In his paintings, these bright colours and motifs are in harmony and are visual treats that can surely cheer up the mood of any visitor. Moreover, you can also get free stickers from the artist.
If you too are in a gloomy mood and want to uplift a little, visit the exhibition that continues till February 6."

T20I Women’s Quadrangular Series: Nepal beat Hong Kong by 6 wickets
","Entrepreneurship education is not just an investment in the education system; it is an investment in the nation’s future prosperity. Photo: Pexels/ Rodnae Productions
In the shadow of the towering Himalayas, Nepal faces a challenge that rivals the steepness of its mountainous terrain- the challenge of economic development. As the nation earnestly pursues its Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), it becomes increasingly evident that a transformation in the education system is not only necessary but also urgent. 
Rooted in common living strategies, the prevailing education model, especially in higher education, may not adequately prepare the youth for the demands of the modern world. 
In this critical juncture, the incorporation of entrepreneurship education emerges as a beacon of hope, offering a pathway towards a self-reliant and prosperous Nepal.
Time to reevaluate the education system
Nepal’s journey towards economic prosperity has been marked by challenges that demand innovative solutions. The commitment of the SDGs reflects not only a global responsibility but also a domestic imperative for sustainable development. For this, it is high time to reevaluate the education system in the country.
The current education system in Nepal, deeply entrenched in common living strategies, has been the foundation of learning for generations. However, in the face of a rapidly evolving world, today’s generation aspires for more than the status quo. The call for independence reverberates through the aspirations of youth who seek a curriculum fostering critical thinking, innovation and entrepreneurial skills.
Entrepreneurship education is a dynamic force capable of reshaping Nepal’s educational landscape. This innovative approach moves beyond traditional learning methods, providing students with the tools to navigate the complexities of the modern world. At its core, entrepreneurship education is about empowering students to implement learned information in practical and tangible ways.
Consider a student engrossed in the intricacies of sensor systems during a science class, entrepreneurship education transforms this theoretical knowledge into practical applications, inspiring the creation of a sensor-operated door. Such innovation born from a fusion of science and entrepreneurship becomes a valuable mindset in solving practical problems.  
Expanding the horizons of entrepreneurship education, let us delve into chemistry. Imagine students studying chemistry not just as a theoretical subject, but also as entrepreneurs in the making. Armed with entrepreneurial principles, these students can tap into Nepal’s rich biodiversity, exploring market demands for products derived from local plants.
In the scenario, chemistry students could embark on a journey to develop performance-enhancing products based on market demand, harnessing the potential of indigenous flora. What makes this approach remarkable is that it does not necessarily require sophisticated machines or extensive human resources. Instead, it leverages the inherent skills and awareness of individuals within the community, paving the way for a grassroots economic revolution.
Entrepreneurship in education

The beauty of entrepreneurship education lies in its universal applicability. It is not confined to science or chemistry alone. Consider an art student, for example. Through entrepreneurship education, they can understand what art to develop (product), how much to set the price (price), where to sell (place) and how to sell (promote) their artworks. Every subject becomes a canvas for innovation and enterprise.
Moreover, entrepreneurship education is a powerful equaliser, recognising the unique skills and talents of individuals across various disciplines. It is not about fitting into a predefined mould but rather about unleashing the potential within each student. When every single person is aware of their skills and potential, they can rise to different levels, contributing to the overall progress of the nation.
Entrepreneurship education goes beyond skill recognition; it is about nurturing the ability to produce goods and mastering the art of marketing. Returning to the example of the student developing a sensor-operated door, entrepreneurship education not only equips them to produce the product but also teaches them how to navigate the complexities of marketing it to potential users and clients.
The impact of entrepreneurship education extends beyond individual success stories; it reverberates through the entire nation. A generation equipped with entrepreneurial skills becomes a driving force for economic growth and independence. They will be able to recognise the resources and ideas to utilise them to reach the global market. They will be able to be the pioneers in products and contribute to the economy. By fostering a culture of innovation, creativity and self-reliance, Nepal can reduce its dependence on external sources and strengthen its economy from within.
In essence, entrepreneurship education is not just an investment in the education system; it is an investment in the nation’s future prosperity. It is a transformative force that has the potential to shape a generation of independent thinkers, innovators and entrepreneurs- the architects of a self-reliant and economically vibrant Nepal. Entrepreneurship education, by teaching students to utilise available resources (physical and financial) and make them commercial, becomes a cornerstone in the nation’s journey towards economic empowerment and independence."

Asia Cup: Cricket team to fly to Pakistan next week
","Ram Bujhaun Yadav with his land ownership certificate stands near a border pillar which he says was erroneously placed on his land. 
In October 2023, when 51-year-old Ram Bujhaun Yadav of Musaharnia Rural Municipality-5, Mukhiyapatti, Dhanusha, was at a relative’s house, someone told him that two Indian Sashastra Seema Bal (SSB) personnel were looking for him.
Anxious, he rushed home wondering why they were looking for him.
“They asked me if the paddy field in the no man’s land was mine. I told them yes and they asked me to cut down the paddy immediately,” he said.
The paddy was not ripe and Yadav asked them for some time. However, the SSB personnel told him he had to cut down his paddy immediately.
Ram Bujhaun and his wife Tetari Devi each own a 677-square-metre plot of land. As Nepal and India reevaluated the border, Ram Bujhan’s land was been deemed to be near the no man’s land as it now has two demarcation pillars.
Frustrated, Ram Bujhaun cut the paddy before it was due to be harvested. Now, he has been asked to not plant anything on the land as it falls in the no man’s land.
“Our border police don’t say a word. I can’t fight the SSB on my own,” says Ram Bujhaun adding he had decided not to plan anything on the land anymore.
Woes of the farmers
Many farmers in southern Nepal say their land has now been placed in India after the recent demarcation. 
When the Jamuna River, which flows through the no man’s land between Nepal and India, changed its course some two decades ago, some border pillars went missing. Locals say these pillars have now been placed encroaching on Nepali land.
In 2018, with the then Chief District Officer of Dhanusha, Pradeep Raj Kandel, and an official from Madhubani district, Bihar, India, a team that included border security forces from both countries, the Armed Police Force of Nepal, and SSB of India began placing border pillars after land measurement by technicians.
Locals have raised concerns, stating that border pillars have been positioned, encroaching approximately 50 to 100 meters of land into Nepal compared to the previous position. Many like Ram Bujhaun are unaware of when these border pillars were placed.
“I did not know that pillar was placed here. After I found out when I asked the village leaders, many said they were placing the border pillars as they pleased,” said Ram Bujhaun.
He was told to carry on planting paddy and that it would not matter as these issues had happened in the past. 
“They encroached on my land and have asked me not to plant anything. This is gross injustice,” he says.
Ram Bujhaun’s family owns a total of 4,000 square metres of land, with 2,000 square metres belonging to him and the remaining 2,000 square metres to his brother Bechan. However, 1,000 square metres of his land is now located on the Indian side after the demarcation. Despite this, he has been farming on the land and continues to pay taxes to the Department of Land Management and Archive in Nepal.
“They have marked my land to be on the Indian side and placed border pillars on it. I’ve been farming till now but I don’t know when they will ask me to stop,” he says.
Ignorance of the government
The Madhesh province in southern Nepal
The former ward chair of Mukhiyapatti Musharniya Rural Municipality-5, Ram Naresh Yadav, said that over time, India has encroached on numerous Nepali lands in various locations in the Madhesh Province. This, he says, happened due to the Nepali administration’s ignorance and weak stature.
“They (Nepali administration) were careless and that meant the Indian side placed these border pillars by encroaching on Nepali land,” says Ram Naresh.
He said that over 40 farmers from wards 1, 5, and 6 have land ranging from 300 to 1,600 square metres on the Indian side. 
“These farmers have land ownership certificates, but they cannot farm as the SSB says the land is in India and not Nepal,” said Ram Naresh.
In 1996, land ownership certificates were distributed after surveying the land in the border area. Local Dharmendra Kumar Yadav said that since then, the locals have been paying their land tax regularly. In 2018, when the pillar was being placed, the locals protested when they saw their land was being encroached on. However, since the demarcation had been agreed upon by high-ranking government officials of Nepal and India, the farmer’s voices went unheard.
“We tried to stop when the border pillars were being placed on our land. But the administrators from both sides forcibly put it there without even trying to hold a discussion,” said Harish Chandra Yadav. 
The Chief District Officer of Dhanusha, Chakrapani Pandey, says that the border pillars were placed by the technical team after the measurements and with the agreement of the high-ranking officials of the two countries.
“The fields and houses that are built in no man’s land have recently been cleared. No one can do anything in this particular area,” said Pandey. “We understand the people’s concern but we cannot do anything about it now.”"

","Regenerative braking representational image. Photo: Freepik
The electric vehicle market in Nepal has grown significantly over the past year. 
Electric four-wheelers and two-wheelers are being launched almost every month, spanning from passenger to commercial vehicles. Electric transportation appears to be an emerging trend in the automotive industry.
New EVs are regularly introduced with advanced features as car companies develop unique electric platforms. One standout feature is regenerative braking.
Regenerative braking was first introduced in 1967 by the American Motor Car Company (AMC) in their prototype electric vehicle, the AMC Amitron. However, Toyota became the automobile manufacturer to implement regenerative braking system (RBS) technology in their Prius series hybrid vehicles in 1997. Toyota brought up the new hybrid technology in the Prius when fuel prices were going up at a massive rate.

But what is regenerative braking? There are still many people confused about what it is, whether it is safe or helpful in fuel economy in hybrid cars and the regeneration of electricity in electric cars.
In simple terms, regen braking is when a car saves energy by recharging its battery when you brake, helping it use less fuel or electricity and go further. Easy but scientifically, regen braking is a process used in vehicles where the kinetic energy produced during braking is converted into electrical energy through an electric motor acting as a generator. This electrical energy is then stored in the vehicle’s battery for later use, reducing energy wastage and increasing overall efficiency.
Photo: Freepik
Regen braking can be seen in all kinds of EVs, including cars, scooters, commercial vans, buses, bicycles, three-wheelers, and rickshaws. It now can be electrically managed to what extent the power and braking can be generated. 
Regenerative Braking work process in EV

Principle of Operation: Regene braking works by turning the energy from slowing down into electricity.
Electric Motor as a Generator: In EV or hybrid cars with regen braking, the motor changes roles from moving the car to making electricity when you brake.
Switching Polarity: When you brake, the motor switches directions, turning energy from the wheels into electricity instead of using it to move the car.
Generation of Electricity: The turning wheels make the motor produce electricity, which goes to the car’s battery.
Power Electronics: Special electronics change the electricity from the motor into the right kind for charging the battery.
Battery Charging: The electricity made during braking charges up the car’s battery, storing the energy for later.
Integration with Hydraulic Braking System: Regenerative braking works with the regular brakes, blending them for smooth stopping.

Advantages and Disadvantages of Regenerative Braking 
The advantages are listed below:

Energy Efficiency: Regenerative braking efficiently captures the kinetic energy generated during braking, effectively reducing energy wastage and contributing to a more sustainable driving experience.
Extended Range: By using the energy that would otherwise be lost during braking as heat and sound, regenerative braking helps to extend the driving range of electric vehicles in instances such as travelling downhill. 
Reduced Brake Wear: Regenerative braking minimizes the strain on traditional braking components, mitigating wear and tear, and potentially extending the lifespan of the braking components such as brake pads, rotors and brake lines, thus reducing maintenance costs over time.
Enhanced Driving Experience: Regenerative braking provides a smoother braking experience and a more responsive feel to drivers, enhancing overall driving comfort and control on the road.

The disadvantages are listed below:

Limited Effectiveness at Low Speeds: While regenerative braking efficiently recaptures energy during braking, its effectiveness diminishes at lower speeds which leads to decreased energy recovery compared to higher speeds.
Complexity and Cost: Implementing regenerative braking adds complexity and cost to vehicle systems, potentially raising manufacturing and maintenance expenses, and impacting consumer affordability.
Maintenance Requirements: Regenerative braking systems require periodic maintenance and calibration to ensure they operate optimally.
Efficiency Variability: Regenerative braking may exhibit variability in efficiency under extreme weather conditions or on certain road surfaces, leading to fluctuations in overall energy recapture and impacting the vehicle’s efficiency.

Misconceptions

Fully Recharges Battery: Some mistakenly believe that regenerative braking fully replenishes the battery, but in reality, it only adds a modest amount of charge.
Increases Braking Distances: There is a misconception that regenerative braking extends braking distances, but it enhances braking performance by complementing traditional brakes.
High-Speed Only: While more effective at higher speeds, regenerative braking still functions at lower speeds, such as during city driving or stop-and-go traffic.
Maintenance-Free: Despite requiring less maintenance than traditional brakes, regen braking systems still need periodic checks and maintenance to ensure proper operation.
Significantly Boosts Range: While regen braking contributes to extending the driving range of electric vehicles, its impact is influenced by various factors beyond just braking efficiency.
Only for Electric Cars: Although commonly associated with electric vehicles, regen braking systems are also found in some conventional vehicles, particularly those aiming to improve fuel efficiency with advanced technology.

Regenerative braking might sound complicated, but it is pretty cool. Think of it as a way for EVs and hybrids to recycle energy when they slow down. Instead of just wasting that energy, regenerative braking turns it into electricity, which can then be used to power the battery."

Machhindra qualify to face Mohun Bagan in 2nd preliminary round of the AFC Cup
","The snow leopard rescued from Urlabari is currently being kept at the Central Zoo in Lalitpur. Photo: Aryan Dhimal
As the gates to the vet clinic at the Central Zoo in Lalitpur opened, more than two dozen photojournalists thronged the facility and surrounded a metal cage aiming their DSLR cameras at a snow leopard inside.
“Please don’t come close to the animal,” the zoo’s vet, Radha Krishna Gharti, told approaching photojournalists. But in the gush of excitement to take exclusive photographs of the elusive cat, difficult to spot even in its prime habitats, there were few takers for the word of caution.
Nepal’s Department of National Parks and Wildlife Conservation (DNPWC) organised the photo-op two days after the male subadult cat, which was until recently found in the country only at altitudes higher than 2,000-6,000 metres above sea level, was brought to the zoo from Urlabari town(146 m above sea level). According to the department, the animal has sustained injuries to its right foreleg and cannot stand upright.
Although officials involved said they are looking at releasing the animal into the wild after it recuperates, doing so will be a daunting task, adding that the zoo may be the only place where it can now survive.
Not a wild cat

“Nepali snow leopard experts have come up with two hypotheses to explain how the animal from the mountains landed up in the plains,” said Sharad Chandra Adhikari, member-secretary at the National Trust for Nature Conservation (NTNC), a semi-government body that manages the zoo in Lalitpur, a town in the Kathmandu Valley. 
The first of the two hypotheses made public during the photo-op-cum-press conference, is that it was raised in captivity and somehow managed to escape into the wild. The second is that it lost its orientation while trying to establish its territory after separating from its mother.
Kulbhushansingh Suryawanshi, director of the India program, Snow Leopard Trust, said that both hypotheses are plausible explanations as to how the snow leopard got to the plains in Nepal.
A DNPWC official, who wished to remain anonymous as he is not authorised to talk to the press, said that it was more likely that the animal had been raised in captivity. 
“The way it sipped the water and ate the food zoo staff offered indicates that it may have been raised in captivity,” the official said.
Snow leopards are shy cats living at extreme altitudes in the steep mountainous areas of 12 countries in Central and South Asia. Their global population spread over altitudes of 500-5,800 m, is estimated to be between around 3,900 and 6,000 as detailed coordinated surveys of the population in the range countries are yet to be carried out. In Nepal, their population divided into three blocks (eastern, central and western) is estimated to be between 301 and 400.
Adhikari from NTNC said that researchers will now examine the animal’s scat to analyse its diet and try to find out whether it was roaming in the wild or had been in some sort of captivity. Researchers are also preparing to analyse its genes to try to find out to which of the three metapopulations in Nepal it belongs. They will also observe the animal’s canine teeth and fur to look for clues.
Relocation challenge

The whole process could take a few months to complete, and summer could set in in Kathmandu by then, officials concede. 
“The current temperature in Kathmandu is suitable for snow leopards, as we are in the peak of winter,” said Madhu Chetri, a snow leopard researcher from NTNC. But that could change as spring season begins in the Northern Hemisphere.
The DNPWC official said that regardless of the findings related to how the animal got to Urlabarli, the animal would have spent a significant amount of time with humans during its recovery phase. “That would mean that it would have gotten habituated with having humans around,” the official said.
Sending such animals back into the wild is a challenge, as they may have lost their hunting and other adaptation skills, he added. In May last year, officials at the Chitwan National Park released two rescued rhino calves into the wild, with limited success. The safety of the animals, which had gotten used to having humans around, was compromised as poachers could easily approach and kill them. Eventually, they were transferred to an enclosure in eastern Nepal away from human intervention.
Veteran conservationist Professor Karan Bahadur Shah said that rewilding the snow leopard would be a daunting task, as the animals are territorial. “If we just leave the animal in its natural habitat, it will get killed by other snow leopards defending their territory,” he said. “The best option would be to keep the animal in the zoo for the public to see.”
But Nepal’s Central Zoo has its own set of problems. The facility, established in 1932 as a private collection, has limited space and has frequently run into financial trouble. Conservationists say the snow leopard would need special facilities to cater to its needs.
“If the government decides that the snow leopard needs to remain at the zoo, we are ready to shoulder the responsibility,” said Adhikari. “We have set up special facilities for animals such as the red panda and chimpanzees,” he said. “We can do that for the snow leopard as well.”
Those advocating for keeping the animal in the zoo also said that Nepal is a snow leopard range country and the public, especially the young generation, also needs to see the different animals found in the country. “It has great educational value,” said Shah.
Snow leopard expert Suryawanshi from neighbouring India also said that it would be challenging to release the animal into the wild. 
“If the team at the zoo can establish the exact cause of this behaviour [why it ventured into the plains] and can keep the animal away from human contact, then it might be okay to release it back,” he said. “But otherwise, there is little hope for it in the wild. Better to let it live in the zoo.”
Back at the zoo, after the photojournalists are done taking photos, it is the turn of the reporters to point their smartphones at the animal. Then there is a contingent of senior wildlife department officials waiting in line to catch a glimpse of the animal. 
“So much for keeping it away from human contact,” a conservationist observing the hullabaloo from a distance said.

Nepal to take on Myanmar before FIFA World Cup Qualifier.
","The National Assembly was formed to give experienced people a chance to be part of the parliament and help during the formation of important bills. In countries that follow the Westminster model of government, the upper house plays an important role. That, however, is not the case in Nepal as the country’s upper house has become a platform where individuals secure positions in the National Assembly based on their connections. As the election nears, many once again question the relevance and existence of the upper house.
Things were different in the past as the initial years of the National Assembly saw experienced politicians and experts others in their field be nominated for the post. That slowly changed as the first batch completed its two-year term.
“I understand why people are frustrated with the upper house. People expected experts but all we got was party cadres who lacked knowledge or experience,” says Bimala Rai Paudyal a National Assembly member. “Considering such behaviour and practices, what distinguishes the House of Representatives from the National Assembly?”
A loser’s second chance 
Narayan Kaji Shrestha, who faced defeat in the 2017 general election from Gorkha-2, was elected as a member of the National Assembly on January 23, 2020. Elected from Gandaki Province, Shrestha currently is the Deputy Prime Minister and Home Minister of the country.
Bhagwati Neupane who lost the election from Gandaki province and Bimala Ghimire who lost the election for mayorship in Bhanu Municipality also shared the same trajectory.
Similarly, Mrigendra Kumar Singh Yadav and Jag Prasad Sharma were defeated in the House of Representatives elections, from Saptari-4 and Dang-3 respectively are now members of the National Assembly. Bam Dev Gautam, who lost the elections from Bardiya, secured a place in the upper house through nomination by President Bidya Devi Bhandari.
Even those who did not win as ward member(s) got the opportunity to become members of the National Assembly including Sindh Bahadur Bishwakarma who was appointed on February 7, 2018. He is soon leaving his post on March 3.
Despite the repeated criticisms, the political parties have not paid attention to this concern posed by political leaders and the general public. The latest proof of this is the list of candidates for the National Assembly elections scheduled on January 25. The list contains names like Krishna Prasad Sitaula, defeated in the House of Representatives elections in 2022 from Koshi Province, and Pooja Chaudhary, who lost in the provincial assembly elections 2022 from Rautahat-3 (a).
Speaker Ganesh Prasad Timilsina, who led the National Assembly for the entire six years under the federal system, is also dissatisfied with the individuals who have made it to the upper house. 
“The allegations are something for the parties to ponder upon. The leaders should have prioritised involving intellectuals/neutrals rather than managing its members,” he says.
The 59-member National Assembly elects eight representatives, equally from all seven provinces, with an additional three individuals nominated by the President. The Constitution ensures representation of women, Dalits, minorities or disabled communities, envisioning that experts, experienced individuals, and the most qualified people from various fields will become members of the National Assembly.
Easy way in
File: A National Assembly meeting
There are some reasons why leaders aspire to join the upper house, and even the leadership create opportunities for them. 
In National Assembly elections, voters consist of local-level heads/deputy heads and provincial assembly members. Typically, individuals seeking these positions undergo a vetting process by their respective parties. As a result, aspiring members of parliament can focus less on persuading individual voters and more on gaining party support to secure their candidacy. 
Moreover, being a member of the National Assembly opens avenues to ministerial roles. The constitution prohibits a National Assembly member from becoming the Prime Minister, but not Deputy Prime Minister. Due to such opportunities, leaders are enticed to seek a position in the assembly.
The National Assembly is currently in its fourth election cycle since the promulgation of the Consitution in 2015. Scheduled for January 25, this election aims to fill 19 seats vacated by individuals completing their six-year terms. The previous election cycles took place in 2017, involving 56 members, followed by 2019 with 18 positions, and 2020 with 19 positions.
The cascading impacts
File: A National Assembly meeting
Another reason why the National Assembly is finding it difficult to justify itself is that it has become a shadow of the House of Representatives. The meeting of the National Assembly did not have one session when the House of Representatives was dissolved by then Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli twice. The demands and issues raised by the opposition parties in the House of Representatives automatically went to the National Assembly, where the parliamentarians of the ruling party put forward any proposal, they endorse it the same as in the House of Representatives.
The latest example – is the main opposition UML did not allow the meeting of the House of Representatives to continue for five days from July 5, 2023, due to a statement made by Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal during his visit to India. Consequently, the meeting of the National Assembly was also paused during that period.
The UML obstructed the House of Representatives for almost a month starting mid-July last year demanding a high-level inquiry committee to probe the 60-kilogram gold smuggling case and the resignation of the Home Minister. The National Assembly followed suit with leaders pushing their agendas forward.
Speaker Ganesh Timilsina himself is dissatisfied that every behaviour and activity of the House of Representatives influence the National Assembly. He says despite his attempts to prevent the overshadowing, it has been unfortunate that he did not garner the goodwill of the top leaders during political disputes.
Reinstating power
The National Assembly is a permanent institution. Therefore, it can remain operational even in the absence of the House of Representatives. Under normal circumstances, Speaker Timilsina initiated a positive practice by personally participating in different committees. Nevertheless, in the absence of the House of Representatives, the National Assembly often experienced inactivity.
In December 2020, the Prime Minister at that time, KP Sharma Oli, dissolved the House of Representatives. Subsequently, a session of the National Assembly was convened on January 1, 2021. Despite lasting only seven hours over four days, this session, which took place after the dissolution, failed to address crucial public issues. Even after six months, important matters remained unaddressed within the House.
On May 22, 2021, the UML-led government once again dissolved the House of Representatives. The meeting of the National Assembly and committees was affected once more. However, the dissolutions were declared unconstitutional by the Supreme Court, reinstating the parliament.
The Constitution says that despite the closing of the National Assembly session, thematic committee meetings can still take place. However, both the National Assembly and its committees remained inactive until the restoration of the House of Representatives.
According to Khimlal Devkota, a member of the National Assembly, when the House of Representatives was dissolved twice, it seemed that the National Assembly was also in a state of dissolution.
Bimala Rai Paudyal also believes that the inability to resume the upper house is a mark of weakness. 
“Since the government was not in a position to call, the President needed to be consulted by the chair together with the consultation committee. That was not done either,” she says.
Constitutional and legal distinctions

Except for the Constitution of Nepal (1962) and the Interim Constitution of Nepal (2007), all other constitutions in Nepal provided for a bicameral parliament with the National Assembly or the Upper House and the House of Representatives or the Lower House. The practices before 2015 were under the unitary governance system, but after the adoption of the federal democratic republican governance system, the role of the National Assembly has changed somewhat.
In the preamble of the constitution prepared by the ‘Constituent Assembly, and Administrative Organ Designation Committee’ during the drafting of the constitution, it is mentioned that some different qualifications have been prescribed for being a member of the House of Representatives and the National Assembly, with the intention that qualified people can be represented in the National Assembly.
Chair of the National Assembly Ganesh Prasad Timilsina restates that the members of the upper house should be assessed based on the country’s expectations with clear criteria. 
There is no definite definition of an expert in the constitution. It has been stated symbolically, “…It is expected that the members should have some basic skills to face the challenges and fulfil their responsibilities.”
According to the constitution, the responsibility of the National Assembly is to correctly establish the rights of the local level, state, and union, and to prevent the House of Representatives from trying to enact laws contrary to the spirit of federalism. There is an explanatory comment in the constitution about the propriety of the National Assembly – “This House is expected to fulfil its role to maintain creative and mutual relations between the national government and the provinces.”
In addition, there are some constitutional and legal differences regarding the National Assembly. But the MPs are demanding that it should cease. When a bill originating in the House of Representatives is passed and sent to the National Assembly, and if the latter does not decide within 60 days, it proceeds de facto.
This has placed the National Assembly in a dilemma. The Chairman of the National Assembly, Timilsina, says, “Such an arrangement should also apply to the House of Representatives, or both should be equal.”
Need for course correction 
PM Pushpa Kamal Dahal speaking in the National Assembly meeting.
Some instances have turned these so-called experts into a laughing stock due to their actions. 
On July 5, 2023,  a discussion on the Electronic Commerce (E-Commerce) Bill 2023 was tabled in the National Assembly. However, the parliamentarians misunderstood the main point and instead discussed the matter of electricity. The MPs, who had not read the proposal, suggested that electricity consumption within Nepal should also be increased besides exporting electricity to India and Bangladesh.
During the meeting, Ramesh Rijal, the Minister of Industry, Commerce and Supplies, also mentioned that India would purchase electricity during the Prime Minister’s visit. Unfortunately, the bill was unanimously approved.
Timilsina considers the incident an example, that in his six-year tenure, he does not want to remember. Som Bahadur Thapa, a former secretary at the Parliament Secretariat, termed the incident ‘a joke’ in the Parliament of Nepal. 
“This is strong proof of the kind of MPs we have, who speak without knowing what they are talking about.” 
Timilsina assumed the role of the speaker/chair of the National Assembly after the establishment of the Federal Democratic Republic. He had the opportunity to establish the system and the dignity of the National Assembly. However, instead of setting a positive example, he will soon be retiring after being accused of playing tricks with the Speaker and showing interest in the work of the House of Representatives.
Timilsina has repeatedly commented on the affairs of the House of Representatives. The latest instance was during a seminar on ‘Japan: Past, Present, and Future’ held in the capital on December 2, 2023, he publicly stated that the election results of the House of Representatives did not bode well.
Pointing to the emergence of a new party and the victory of some independent candidates, he said, “In a democracy, you get to choose candidates, irrespective of their party affiliation. However, is the signal positive?”
In August/ September 2022, Timilsina wrote a letter to the Election Commission, urging them to extend the tenure of Speaker and Deputy Speaker. Upon receiving a response stating that the Commission would not determine the tenure of the elected Parliament, Timilsina directed the Parliament Secretariat not to execute decisions made by the Management Committee after September 17, 2022.
This created conflict between the Speaker of the House of Representatives and the Speaker of the National Assembly and in the crux of this dispute between the parties, the country had to bear the consequences of this conflict. Laws could not be enacted promptly, and the place once considered the domain of experts was overshadowed by the party’s interest. 
A study conducted by the Democracy Resource Center Nepal (DRCN) on the legislative functioning of the National Assembly has revealed that the Upper House has passed some bills that go against the spirit of federalism.
The report’s concluding remarks say, “…the bills passed by the House of Representatives have not undergone significant changes or discussions in the National Assembly. The conclusion section of the study states that – “Furthermore, some bills, contradicting the spirit of federalism and addressing the interests of interest groups, have been approved by the National Assembly.”
Overall, in the last six years, parties have introduced individuals who, given their presentation level, have raised questions about the National Assembly’s justification. If there are no changes in the constitution, laws, and policies concerning the upper assembly, these concerns will persist.”"

While most of the nation was preparing for the festival of lights, Tihar in early November 2023, something no less exciting was fuelling our sparks from oceans away. A queer art festival was happening for the seventeenth year and we had a chance to attend it as delegates. Our delegation was made possible through the collaboration between the Outburst Arts, an art organisation based in Northern Ireland, UK and the British Council, Nepal.
There is a clear distinction between cities in terms of their flourishing arts scenes, and this became apparent during a visit to Belfast, Northern Ireland, specifically for the Outburst Queer Arts Festival held in the charming city centre. The organisation of such a festival requires months of careful preparation and planning.
The queer art festival started as short events lasting a few days. Now, after 17 years, it has grown into a ten-day festival with panel discussions, theatre performances, and exhibitions. Program guides were available at venues, partner hotels, local libraries, and shops. Many delegates, including us, came from outside Northern Ireland to attend.
During the queer art festival, we had the opportunity to connect with art curators, publishers, artists, and representatives from other British Council departments around the world (Lithuania, France, South Africa, Turkey, Greece, Jordan, England, and Argentina to name a few.) 
Each event that we attended gave us a different insight into what the arts can do and how it can facilitate connections. We gained insights from queer publishers and art curators on the challenges they face in their own countries due to resources and sometimes from bureaucracy in systems. We also got to see the way people can thrive when given a platform to showcase their works, such as an art exhibition in which the artist reimagined intimacy for queer people.
On the other hand, Nepal struggles by and large at times for queer visibility. There are no explicit spaces for SOGIESC (Sexual Orientation, Gender Identity and Expressions and Sex Characteristics) artists to showcase their works nor openly come together as a community, it all exists in pocket spaces. In the same way, something that struck us was the presence of older queer artists at the festival. 
It was not just for one particular event during the queer art festival. We noticed an active participation and involvement of older queer people throughout the festival there. It was fascinating to see queer artists in their 40s and 50s share their transformative and inspiring work. Whereas, back home, the queer folks at the forefront of queer art, advocacy and activism are mostly Gen-Zs and millennials. We have very few queer elders that we can count on our fingers who are diligently working for Nepali queer folks. Even among them, some still hold onto archaic notions and refuse to evolve and embrace changes. So, there’s that.
From dream to reality

Before being selected as delegates, both of us joined online meetings with British Council Nepal and the Outburst representatives facilitated through Kaalo 101 (an art space in Patan), along with interested queer artists from Nepal. We had a total of three meetings where we discussed the possibilities and challenges of doing a queer art festival in Nepal. 
The discourse also entailed us sharing a presentation about the updates of the queer art scene in Nepal in the last five years. The updates included memorable leaps taken in queer arts from music to literature and fashion and more by artists from diverse walks of life. Days after the third meeting, the British Council extended invitations to us to attend the Outburst Queer Arts Festival.
Our delegation is just one example of the transcontinental collaboration because it was something that happened for the first time and involved us. But, Outburst Arts and the British Council have been practising cross-continental collaboration for years. Even in this year’s festival, we witnessed a lot of artists from different continents work together in exhibitions, lectures, panel discussions, magazines and so on. The amalgamation introduced us to brilliant thought-provoking work that defies gender and sociopolitical norms. The power of transcontinental collaboration was beyond beautiful.
Imagining queer arts in Nepal

The queer art scene in Nepal is an emerging one. While a full-fledged festival may not be possible now, something small yet significant is achievable. Time and again, different organisations have been running large art exhibitions/tours for weeks and months. However, in the microcosm that is Nepal, especially Kathmandu, the capital is no stranger to art-oriented programs. What it has been unfamiliar with precisely is queer art. And the unfamiliarity is not something induced by the lack of queer artists and their art. Sadly, it is because of inadequate platforms, space and resources to pursue queer arts.
Despite this, through the years there have been events and literature that have emerged centring on queer identity, but it has not come without its challenges. On collections of stories, “Pride Climbing Higher” and “Songs of Revolution” showcase stories from Nepalis across Nepal. There are not many stories reflecting the Nepali queer experiences otherwise. 
June Pride Parade by Queer Youth Group has gained momentum as well in the past few years since its conception, from a small gathering to now a large parade with performances from community members. The same can be said about Blue Diamond Society’s (BDS) Rainbow Visibility Pride events in August during the festival of Saa-Paru (Gai Jatra) which has been running for well over a decade; in recent years they have included flash mobs and interaction programmes as well in lead up to their parade. Individuals within the community have also organised their queer gatherings with friends, thus coming back to the cosmos of pocket spaces in celebrating queerness.
While artists like us are creative with what we want to put out, we still need organisations like the British Council to foster spaces and connections to enable us to do that. Then and again, artists have come together and collaborated on queer-centric projects. But, we need funding and resources to achieve bigger-scale projects that unite more artists and transcend borders.
Both of us advocate for queer rights and are involved in programs and activities that push the narrative further, extend the visibility of the community and normalise conversations surrounding queerness. Among other things, we are also the founders of Queering The Bond, a networking collective for Nepali queer folks and Shuby is also the founder of Queer Honky-Tonk, a platform to promote queer performances and networking with events such as a drag show or open mic every few months. However, both of us, individually or collaboratively can only do so much. 

The challenges of living in a capitalistic world oftentimes outweigh the passion we have for the queer art scene in Nepal. And this is where we expect the government and organisations to step up with policies, platforms and programs to provide spaces, opportunities and resources for queer artists. Here, the British Council joined hands with Outburst Arts, which paved the way for our delegation. We would not have known about the marvellous queer art festival at the other end of the world otherwise.
Besides the limitations brought by insufficient spaces and social unawareness, the centralised capital does hinder queer artists from outside the city to connect, create and collaborate. Art already is centralised and elitist. On top of that, the concentrated Kathmandu Valley is of no help when it comes to making art accessible beyond its borders.
Furthermore, there is also the expectation from basically everyone to have the perfect festival that caters to all people’s needs and wants. While the festival, if it should happen, is bound to be done with the right intentions, there is a lot of pressure for the first-time event itself. The festival will be inclusive and diverse. But, realistically speaking, it would be a struggle to make it relevant to each queer person from east to west.
Speaking of struggles, a visceral feeling of uneasiness swarmed over me with each step I took while exiting the airport after the flight back home. I, Birat, personally felt that I could not be as free or unrestrained in Nepal as I was during my time in Belfast. No wonder a lot of the queer people we know opt for abroad.
Seventeen years ago, when the Outburst Queer Arts Festival first began, it certainly was not as celebrated or large as it is now. What we are trying to convey here is that we do not have to start big. We can aim for something small yet promising. While there might be expectations to check all the boxes, it is crucial to be mindful of our capacity as well. But, we can be capacitated and this is where you – people in power, art enthusiasts, grant and resource allocators and media come in. It is time we all believe in Nepali queer art and create space for it to not only survive but thrive. It is imperative to understand that formulating our imagination into reality can only be possible through unwavering collaboration."
Posts navigation,"The month of January saw major road accidents in different parts of the country, including Lamhi in Dang, Dhorpatan in Baglung, and Chandragiri in Kathmandu. Road accidents have been common throughout the country with Nepal Police data suggesting over 2,500 people dying in them annually. Despite this, the Ministry of Finance has shown reluctance to introduce the proposed Road Safety Bill to reduce traffic accidents, fatalities, and serious injuries, and enhance road safety. 
Instead, the Finance Ministry has asked the Ministry of Physical Infrastructure and Transport to include the proposed bill in the Public Roads Act. Along with that, the government’s initiative to pass dedicated laws on road safety and set up a mechanism, including the empowered National Road Safety Council (NRSC), to decrease accidents, has come to a halt.
Keshav Kumar Sharma, secretary of the Ministry of Physical Infrastructure and Transport, says they asked for a dedicated road safety law that comprehensively addresses institutional arrangements was the need of the hour. This includes ensuring safety in road construction, promoting public awareness, providing training and communication facilities, implementing rescue mechanisms, and arranging rehabilitation for families affected by road accidents. However, the Ministry of Finance believes a separate law is unnecessary due to concerns about potential increased financial burden.
Hourly need

Officials from the Ministry of Physical Infrastructure allege that the Ministry of Finance is approaching sensitive matters, such as passenger safety, solely from an economic standpoint. They say that concerns related to road, vehicle, and passenger safety are being overshadowed, and there are indications that this approach will continue. 
“The government is avoiding addressing the sensitive issue of road accidents and the associated human and material costs, fearing an increase in expenses. This contradicts the government’s commitment and policy to reduce traffic accidents in the future,” says an official from the Ministry of Physical Infrastructure on the condition of anonymity.
According to the Ministry of Physical Infrastructure, the existing laws lack the vision and purpose necessary for developing a sustainable, safe, risk-free, and reliable transportation operation and security system. Therefore, the Ministry of Physical Infrastructure officials argue that a distinct law is essential to decrease road accidents and ensure the safety of pedestrians, including passenger transport workers and roadside residents, as well as pets, wild animals, and birds. 
“The Road Safety Act is the need of the hour as it will help us during post-accident rescue, treatment management, rehabilitation, and legal representation,” says the official.
Currently, there are gaps in enforcing road rules, monitoring vehicle capacities, ensuring road structure safety, managing traffic signs, and organizing road safety facilities. The implementation of the Road Safety Act is seen as crucial to address these issues.
However, there has not been a facilitative environment for providing education and raising awareness about road traffic safety, safety mechanisms, and coordinating among organisations related to road transport. The aspect of training drivers with skills and knowledge, as well as monitoring road safety on the roads, is also lacking. This is why experts have been suggesting introducing a separate road safety law to address these aspects.
The Finance Ministry, however, says that road safety should not be downplayed by ignoring human sensibilities related to road safety and citing economic reasons. Officials from the Ministry of Physical Infrastructure argue that incorporating safety considerations in the Road Act does not automatically result in a decrease in accidents or the integration of post-accident rescue, relief, and rehabilitation efforts.
“The existing laws do not address road safety anywhere. Due to its lack of clarity and inadequacy, it has not been implemented with due diligence. For instance, provisions such as those for vehicle inspectors outlined in the Transport Act have not been acted upon by the government,” says an official from the Transport Ministry.
Policies and commitments, but no laws

The Motor Vehicles and Transport Management Act (1993) includes several provisions related to vehicle registration, road permits, driver’s licenses, traffic management, insurance, and penalties. The Public Roads Act (1974) primarily focuses on road management. However, there is no provision in the Act regarding the National Road Safety Council.
In this situation, Nepal has developed a 10-year road safety action plan but is yet to enact corresponding legislation. Unfortunately, government agencies and mechanisms are not obligated to follow the action plan, as it lacks legal guidance.
Now, the Transport Ministry holds the view that if safety considerations are explicitly addressed in the Public Roads Act, the outcome will not differ from what the Finance Ministry has said. Given the Public Roads Act’s close association with the Department of Road, the ministry thinks greater emphasis will be placed on road construction. However, they argue that incorporating the road safety aspect into the Act would not be effective.
Secretary Sharma of the Transport Ministry is tasked with ensuring road safety, overseeing physical infrastructure and transport, and coordinating efforts across education, health, home, law, federal affairs, and general administration ministries. This responsibility extends to provincial ministries, local levels, as well as various agencies, organisations, security agencies, non-governmental organisations, and related entities, each with their specific roles.
“As all the agencies need to be allocated responsibilities for various aspects of road safety, we have requested them to collaborate in formulating a distinct law. This should encompass the reduction of all types of accidents,” said Sharma.
The ministry believes that a dedicated law addressing road safety is crucial to mitigate severe road accidents in Nepal and to uphold the commitments made by the country on the international stage.
Nepal has committed to implementing the Stockholm Declaration through the Global Road Traffic Safety Conference in 2020, as per the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. Nepal, which has incorporated sustainable development goals into its national development plan, has not yet commenced work aligned with these objectives.

Nevertheless, Nepal’s neighbouring countries are already addressing road safety through legal frameworks. Various states in India have enacted road safety laws, and the effectiveness of these laws is contributing to a 50 per cent reduction in road accidents.
In 1999, Bhutan also introduced a unified road safety and transport act. Pakistan, on the other hand, issued the National Highway Safety Ordinance-2000 to ensure road safety, distinct from its National Highway Authority Act (1991). Britain, Australia, America, New Zealand, and other countries have established separate road safety laws as well.
Road safety neglected
In Nepal, road safety has been consistently neglected due to the absence of dedicated legislation. Road safety expert Keshav Adhikari says that the government primarily focused on road construction, overlooks crucial aspects such as road safety and reinforcement. Consequently, roads are transforming into perilous pathways for both vehicles and passengers.
“There is a lack of interest in formulating policies and laws aimed at mitigating financial losses resulting from accidents,” says Adhikari.
He further points out that safety is not a governmental priority, as expanding the road network is perceived to yield more political benefits than implementing additional structures to enhance road safety.
“When I worked as an expert in the Transport Ministry for over a year, I realised that promoting road safety is not a government priority,” he says. “Annually, more people die due to road accidents than those who die in natural disasters, but the government has not given it much attention.”
Even though the prime minister, ministers, and MPs keep asserting that roads have been constructed, no one seems to be addressing the critical issues of road safety and quality.
Saroj Sitaula, General Secretary of the Federation of Nepalese National Transport Entrepreneurs (FNNTE), says that the government must be attentive as accidents are on the rise due to various technical and human factors, including road infrastructure. 
“Many accidents can be mitigated by improving road conditions, installing barriers on the sides, putting up informational boards, and ensuring scientific and practical road markings,” he says. “We need to formulate a plan and progress accordingly.”
Sitaula argues that the government should establish policies to create mechanisms for emergency rescue, treatment, and rehabilitation after an accident occurs. He emphasises the importance of enhancing road infrastructure, conducting a scientific examination of the technical condition of vehicles, and ensuring compliance with the law by drivers, passengers, and regulators. He says that blaming drivers and transport entrepreneurs for accidents is inadequate, and the government must fulfil its responsibilities.
Roads are unsafe

Nepal currently boasts a road network spanning approximately 100,000 km, with the majority consisting of dirt and gravel roads. Among the more than 22,000 kilometres of national and subsidiary highways, numerous sections remain unpaved.
Despite the government’s substantial investment in road construction and expansion, minimal efforts are allocated to ensuring road safety. 
Recently, all three levels of government have accelerated the widening of roads, incorporating asphalt and slopes. However, it appears that issues concerning road quality and safety are escalating at a faster pace. Roads that have been neglected in the guise of maintenance have become a nightmare for the public.
Infrastructure expert Suryaraj Acharya notes that these problems arise due to the tendency to construct roads only after they have sustained damage, without considering potential issues during the initial construction phase."

Role of entrepreneurship education in Nepal’s quest for economic empowerment 
","Ram Bujhaun Yadav with his land ownership certificate stands near a border pillar which he says was erroneously placed on his land. 
In October 2023, when 51-year-old Ram Bujhaun Yadav of Musaharnia Rural Municipality-5, Mukhiyapatti, Dhanusha, was at a relative’s house, someone told him that two Indian Sashastra Seema Bal (SSB) personnel were looking for him.
Anxious, he rushed home wondering why they were looking for him.
“They asked me if the paddy field in the no man’s land was mine. I told them yes and they asked me to cut down the paddy immediately,” he said.
The paddy was not ripe and Yadav asked them for some time. However, the SSB personnel told him he had to cut down his paddy immediately.
Ram Bujhaun and his wife Tetari Devi each own a 677-square-metre plot of land. As Nepal and India reevaluated the border, Ram Bujhan’s land was been deemed to be near the no man’s land as it now has two demarcation pillars.
Frustrated, Ram Bujhaun cut the paddy before it was due to be harvested. Now, he has been asked to not plant anything on the land as it falls in the no man’s land.
“Our border police don’t say a word. I can’t fight the SSB on my own,” says Ram Bujhaun adding he had decided not to plan anything on the land anymore.
Woes of the farmers
Many farmers in southern Nepal say their land has now been placed in India after the recent demarcation. 
When the Jamuna River, which flows through the no man’s land between Nepal and India, changed its course some two decades ago, some border pillars went missing. Locals say these pillars have now been placed encroaching on Nepali land.
In 2018, with the then Chief District Officer of Dhanusha, Pradeep Raj Kandel, and an official from Madhubani district, Bihar, India, a team that included border security forces from both countries, the Armed Police Force of Nepal, and SSB of India began placing border pillars after land measurement by technicians.
Locals have raised concerns, stating that border pillars have been positioned, encroaching approximately 50 to 100 meters of land into Nepal compared to the previous position. Many like Ram Bujhaun are unaware of when these border pillars were placed.
“I did not know that pillar was placed here. After I found out when I asked the village leaders, many said they were placing the border pillars as they pleased,” said Ram Bujhaun.
He was told to carry on planting paddy and that it would not matter as these issues had happened in the past. 
“They encroached on my land and have asked me not to plant anything. This is gross injustice,” he says.
Ram Bujhaun’s family owns a total of 4,000 square metres of land, with 2,000 square metres belonging to him and the remaining 2,000 square metres to his brother Bechan. However, 1,000 square metres of his land is now located on the Indian side after the demarcation. Despite this, he has been farming on the land and continues to pay taxes to the Department of Land Management and Archive in Nepal.
“They have marked my land to be on the Indian side and placed border pillars on it. I’ve been farming till now but I don’t know when they will ask me to stop,” he says.
Ignorance of the government
The Madhesh province in southern Nepal
The former ward chair of Mukhiyapatti Musharniya Rural Municipality-5, Ram Naresh Yadav, said that over time, India has encroached on numerous Nepali lands in various locations in the Madhesh Province. This, he says, happened due to the Nepali administration’s ignorance and weak stature.
“They (Nepali administration) were careless and that meant the Indian side placed these border pillars by encroaching on Nepali land,” says Ram Naresh.
He said that over 40 farmers from wards 1, 5, and 6 have land ranging from 300 to 1,600 square metres on the Indian side. 
“These farmers have land ownership certificates, but they cannot farm as the SSB says the land is in India and not Nepal,” said Ram Naresh.
In 1996, land ownership certificates were distributed after surveying the land in the border area. Local Dharmendra Kumar Yadav said that since then, the locals have been paying their land tax regularly. In 2018, when the pillar was being placed, the locals protested when they saw their land was being encroached on. However, since the demarcation had been agreed upon by high-ranking government officials of Nepal and India, the farmer’s voices went unheard.
“We tried to stop when the border pillars were being placed on our land. But the administrators from both sides forcibly put it there without even trying to hold a discussion,” said Harish Chandra Yadav. 
The Chief District Officer of Dhanusha, Chakrapani Pandey, says that the border pillars were placed by the technical team after the measurements and with the agreement of the high-ranking officials of the two countries.
“The fields and houses that are built in no man’s land have recently been cleared. No one can do anything in this particular area,” said Pandey. “We understand the people’s concern but we cannot do anything about it now.”"

Life is filled with surprises and unexpected events and it can change at any moment. The only thing certain in life is the uncertainty. Change is a natural and inevitable part of our lives, and it may be positive as well as negative.
Even though it is not guaranteed that we will wake up in the morning, we set the alarm every night with the hope that we will wake up in the morning. We do not know what each day is going to bring us, but we may have varieties, adventures, and endless opportunities.
The push to explore
The uncertainty sometimes forces us to explore those aspects of life, we never knew existed or needed. It also tests the mental strength of people and how they deal with it. The uncertainty has taught me to be grateful, as we never know what life throws at us.
In life, everything does not go according to our plans, and if we do not embrace the change we will face huge trouble. The Covid-19 pandemic is the best example of uncertainty, we were constantly fearing death and it was uncertain that we would see the sunrise the next day.
It is not certain that every decision in life will be correct, but if you fear not trying at all, you miss endless opportunities for learning and growing. When our decisions or outcomes are on the negative side, we get depressed and we might tend to think about committing suicide, but we forget that if we have life we have endless opportunities. 
Most of us plan for our careers, our love life, etc. and when those plans do not work out we start getting uncomfortable. But if we can deal with today, we can surely deal with tomorrow. We need to cherish little moments in our lives and know that nothing is permanent not even the failures and setbacks.
We come here with nothing and leave with nothing. So why should we hold the egos and grudges against each other? Instead of making our life meaningful and enjoying the journey of life, we get into puzzles of accumulating wealth and we go against our own loved ones for it. 
Change is certain

Nothing is permanent in life, everything can change in fractions of seconds. In today’s society, everyone is so busy, that we people have so less time for our loved ones. What I have learned over the years, is to find time in our busy schedule for our family because we never know when it will be our last day together with them. 
Yes! Death is a natural process, so if you have to die someday, why should you die with grudges in your heart? But instead of worrying about the inevitable, focusing on the things you can control will bring a lot of happiness in life.
Uncertainty is not only a negative thing; it also brings a lot of opportunity because you dare to change. The life-changing experience will not come knocking down your door, you need to expose yourself. We learn by doing and experimenting, even though we might fail. But that is not the end of the world. I still remember hesitating while applying for the role of leadership, at my school level as it was not certain that I would be chosen.
Even after being selected, I was uncertain about whether I could fulfil my responsibilities or not. But that uncertainty helped me grow out of my comfort zone and give my best input. If I had not applied for that role just because I was uncertain of the outcome, I would miss the biggest learning opportunity in my school life. So, do not let the uncertainty or the unknown ever stop you from trying and no matter how much we try, to plan life always finds a way to surprise us. 
It is important to stay grounded when we have everything we wish for because life can take such a turn that we had never expected in our wildest dreams. Similarly, nothing is permanent in life, the financial hardships, the grades, the breakups, etc. But the most important thing is not to lose hope during those difficult times.
According to the data provided by Nepal police, around 6,830 people took their lives in the fiscal year 2022/23. There is nothing in life that cannot be resolved although it may take time, committing suicide should not be an option. It’s important to share feelings among family members or loved ones because together as a family any problem can be overcome.
Embrace the unknown and focus on enhancing your life, instead of worrying about what will happen next. Always find time for your loved ones, as life is uncertain. We should be grateful that we are alive and accept that change is the only constant thing in life. Do not let the unknown, stop you from trying or achieving your goals and always remember that even if you fail, you still have endless opportunities."

Fitness has become a top priority for those considering health and well-being. It has gained immense popularity across all social media platforms, and fitness influencers have emerged as influential agents of change, motivating millions. And when it comes to fitness, Tyson Moktan is one of these influencers, as he has established himself as a trailblazing powerlifter in the country.
Starting as a passionate athlete and talented tennis player, Moktan has now become the country’s first professional powerlifter. He has achieved remarkable personal milestones and gained respect as a strength powerlifting coach. He has taken part in countless competitions in Nepal and abroad becoming one of to go to guys for powerlifting in the country.
Now, Moktan, who is a strength powerlifting coach at Ox Strength, wants to continue grooming young talents. Having successfully coached multiple national champions, his passion continues to drive him to support and nurture young talent. He firmly believes that by providing guidance and mentorship to emerging athletes, he can contribute to putting Nepal on the global map of powerlifting.
Getting into the zone

Tyson Moktan has been a highly competitive individual since his childhood. He embarked on his fitness journey at the age of 16 as he wanted to stay in shape. He was into sports from his childhood but gradually shifted to bodybuilding as he had a knack for it. As a year went by, he found his true passion – powerlifting.
“As I have been competitive all my life, I wanted an outlet to pursue a gym lifestyle, so I initially explored bodybuilding and men’s physique. However, in the end, I realised that powerlifting was the perfect fit for me,” he says.
Powerlifting is an extremely demanding form of fitness that requires immense dedication and effort. At the time when he started, Nepal had no professional powerlifters, but Moktan took it upon himself to pioneer the sport in the country.
“I conducted extensive research and received online coaching, which significantly enhanced my skills and knowledge in powerlifting,” he says. However, finding suitable platforms for showcasing his talent was a challenge.
“When I ventured into powerlifting, it was still a relatively new concept in our country. I was searching for a competitive outlet and started participating in local competitions in Nepal,” he says.
Tyson Moktan has always made it a priority to stay updated with the latest information and technology in the fitness industry. He has crafted a routine that has remained consistent and rewarding since the beginning. His passion for the gym and the incredible outcomes it brings have made training an integral part of his life.

“My fitness routine has remained the same since the beginning. I don’t feel the need to change it because I love doing it passionately. I can’t go a few days without training. It has become a natural part of my progression,” he says.
Tyson Moktan’s first powerlifting competition in 2016 thrust him into the spotlight of the Nepali fitness industry. Following that, he became the first registered Crossfit L1 Trainer in Nepal and embarked on his coaching career.
One of Moktan’s most impactful moments occurred in late 2017 when he achieved a monumental lift of 250 kg, a weight that no one from Nepal had accomplished before. This achievement strengthened his belief in the power of determination and motivated him to train even harder.
“I felt like I could do anything if I put my mind to it. It was an incredible feeling of being on top of the world,” he says.
From that day forward, Tyson Moktan dedicated himself to becoming a top powerlifter. Understanding his end goals, creating sustainable plans, and trusting the process became the key pillars of his success. 
Moktan has been a winner of the pump powerlifting meet open categories from 2016- 2018. In 2020, he also bagged the second position and set a national squat record with 245.5 kg during the Thailand National Championships U93. 
He aspires to continue pushing the boundaries in the sport as an athlete himself while helping other athletes and fitness enthusiasts reach their full potential.

With his years of training, experience, education, and knowledge, Moktan has established Ox Strength to coach individuals virtually, aiming to achieve unimaginable goals.
A life of determination
Tyson Moktan places great emphasis on the importance of proper planning in one’s fitness journey. He believes that sustainable progress and dedication can be achieved by getting in the zone and following a well-thought-out plan.
“There is a quote that says, ‘Failing to plan is planning to fail.’ I strongly adhere to that. As long as you have a sustainable plan and a clear understanding of your end goal, planning and taking one step at a time while trusting the process is all you need,” he says.
In a world where the lines can often be blurred by performance-enhancing drugs, Moktan firmly believes in maintaining a natural approach to fitness. He meticulously balances his diet and avoids relying on supplements, instead focusing on a wholesome approach to nutrition.
“There is a clear distinction between protein shakes and performance-enhancing substances. I believe in staying natural and considering supplements as a convenient form of food that helps complete my protein intake,” he says.
Reflecting on prevalent trends in the fitness industry, Moktan advocates for a discerning approach. While flashy movements may initially attract people to sports and fitness, he believes that true progress lies in sticking to the basics and understanding one’s journey.
Moktan strongly believes in delivering quality content that offers valuable information to his followers. He remains dedicated to his small yet loyal audience who seek his coaching expertise and support him wholeheartedly. He consciously chooses not to chase fleeting trends or prioritise being at the top of social media.

“I believe in sticking to the basics. I don’t force myself to follow the latest trends. Providing quality information and valuable tips is important to me. I have a small group of dedicated followers on social media, and that is what matters to us. We are not targeting a large audience who are just there for entertainment,” he says.
Tyson Moktan’s coaching extends beyond the realm of powerlifting, as he also assists individuals on weight loss journeys and helps athletes achieve multiple national records.
“Each client is unique, with different backgrounds, experiences, and challenges. Effective communication and understanding are crucial. I work closely with my clients to develop personalised training programs that ensure long-term success,” he says.
With his unwavering dedication, pioneering spirit, and commitment to sustainable training, Tyson Moktan continues to make a lasting impact in the world of strength sports and coaching."

In 2023, Barbie named Women in Sports as their career of the year.
Whenever I am out and about socially, there is always someone who seems pretty certain about not considering my profession as mainstream. Hold up! Sports as a career? In Nepal? You bet! This article aims to explain why women in this male-dominant sports industry in Nepal should not be viewed as a surprise.
I have been part of the Nepali cricket industry in a private capacity for quite a while now. Armed with a Master’s Degree in IT from an American University, my choice to stick with sports management tends to raise eyebrows. While I am not an on-field player, I am definitely behind the scenes, playing strong games of serious deliverance with my team. We are all about creating what is not there.
As untouched and less discussed as the sports management industry is in Nepal, it has ample room to showcase creativity. Being a commanding woman in a position can be challenging, but on the brighter side, the gender advantage has yet to fail me. As alien as I might be in sports management in Nepal, I have been accepted with open arms. The nature of the job is highly competitive, no doubt.

Women in sports are safe, heard, and welcomed. I absolutely relish the addition of spirited women to the team. The nuances of sports are something women complement greatly. Sports management inherently rejects narrow minds. There is a lot of travelling, meeting people, experimenting, and remembering limitations. The adjustments are both trivial and clever. 
Often, in our part of the world, societal norms limit women from making career decisions, hindering them from living life on their terms. This restriction potentially keeps many capable women from pursuing the sports industry, where they could truly wield their power to make an impact. Change is gradual, and I hope to see numerous female faces in charge of stadiums someday in Nepal.
Yes, there are challenges. It ranges from personal sacrifices to job security and opportunities. However, these are workable factors for any freelancer in sports management. The key is excelling at our jobs to thrive anywhere. 
Taking a page from the medical field, the seriousness we apply there should not differ in sports management. Sports is a powerful industry. Children grow up idolising what we showcase on TV. As glorious as the game is, it is every child’s dream to represent their country someday. Carrying that responsibility is our role in sports—an often thankless yet deeply satisfying job.

Sports may be a smaller industry in Nepal, but globally, it is a behemoth. The world economy has shifted, and it is time we alter our perspective to recognise the potential of sports as an industry in Nepal. The idea of open commercialisation of sports remains somewhat unexplored, as it continues to be a more exclusive affair in Nepal. 
By sourcing innovative ideas, there’s a wealth of public attention and investment waiting to be tapped into, along with numerous practices to establish and discard. As the Nepali team achieves international records, the packaging of the sport becomes everything. There is plenty to learn from international sports management to make our industry highly marketable and poised for global entry.
Sports such as cricket, football, volleyball, or even golf serve as key intersections for reshaping Nepal’s global narrative. Over the years, Kabaddi has witnessed a substantial surge in India, both in terms of viewership and commercial success. The primary challenge we grapple with is Nepal’s comparatively small market size, posing constraints on our ability to generate substantial economic gains. Therefore, there is unanimous agreement on the imperative for Nepal’s sports to venture onto the international stage.
Nepal boasts many hardworking individuals, yet achieving this goal demands specialised talents in sports management with the requisite experience and the capacity to enhance existing values. In the long run, outsourcing such talents may foster dependence. Hence, a concerted effort is needed to inspire Nepali youth to engage in sports management, contributing to our sports ecosystem. 
There are various ways in which we can harness the potential of sports for our benefit. Encouraging youth involvement can be instrumental in capitalising on the multifaceted opportunities presented by the sports industry. There is a lot to explore if you think about it."

","Painting ‘My Private Life’ by artist Priyam Pradhan at the exhibition Mani at Siddhartha Art Gallery, Baber Mahal. Photo: Chandra Bahadur Ale
Using Pitt’s artist pen on paper, artist Priyam Pradhan presents My Private Life, a showcase of the current significance of his life depicted in abstract form.
At the centre of the painting is a 1000-rupee note, within which Pradhan has intricately painted Lord Krishna, a man wearing a hoodie tenderly embracing his dog, and a woman. The woman stands tall, elongated in form. Towards the bottom of the canvas, a holy man reaches out his hands, appearing to be in flight.
Priyam Pradhan has used a vibrant colour palette, incorporating bright hues such as pink, orange, and yellow, as well as green, black, white, and grey. This combination adds a dynamic and lively quality to the artwork.
“The man in the centre is me and the girl in green is my girlfriend. And the faces are my mom and dad,” says Pradhan. “The sadhu (holy man) symbolises my desires that I don’t have many desires for materialistic things however I do understand the value of money.”
The use of colours, figures and lines in an abstract form in his painting resembles the painting of American painter Paul Jackson Pollock. Like his abstract expressionism, Pradhan has expressed himself in his painting.
Furthermore, this marks Priyam Pradhan’s third solo painting exhibition titled Mani (money), inaugurated on January 17 at Siddhartha Art Gallery, Baber Mahal.
In his previous exhibitions, Pradhan’s artworks centred around Hindu philosophy and his spontaneous thought process. However, in this latest exhibition, he explores the theme of money and its impact on an individual’s life, delving into the reverberating effects of financial aspects.
Understanding the value of money

Any form of art is known as a reflection of the contemporary time. Likewise, Priyam Pradhan’s paintings reflect the lifestyle, desires, obligations and more of today’s younger generation living in urban areas in Nepal.
Pradhan himself is in his 20s and he has justified the want of most of the youngsters in their 20s, who might be declared adults and understand the need for money and materialistic things but are still kids at their heart who want to explore and experience life as much as possible.
The exhibition has 27 paintings which Pradhan took around nine months to complete. According to him, while he was travelling the idea that his life was luxurious and him being capable of exploring anything he wanted to was because of money.
And being an artist this concept lingered on him and he was compelled to create on the theme of money.
Once you enter the gallery, you can also view an animated video, which introduces artist Pradhan and the importance of money, which is on the ground floor. On the first floor, a huge painting (193×62 in cm) Apatkalin Awastha using mixed media on canvas welcomes you and other paintings are small in size (18×30 in cm).
“It is a team work and it is my introduction as an artist for the exhibition,” he says. “Also, being a recent multimedia graduate from Islington College, I wanted to explore my skills and I got my team. Then, like money, multimedia is relevant to current society.”
Experiencing life through art

Priyam Pradhan says enjoyment is the meaning of life and he enjoys creating artwork. Moreover, Pradhan who came into the art world first being a tattoo artist feels blessed that he has the privilege to explore whatever he likes in his life.
He also believes that the philosophy that says one should not be materialistic is wrong. “If material things are not important, why would one build a house? And after building a house why do they want to decorate their house?” he questions.
Alongside, money and materialistic things, his paintings also explore love, romance, life and childhood experiences. Motifs like Pokemon, ramen noodles, animals, dancers, etc have been used in his paintings. In most of his paintings, he has used numerous white lines in wavy form and these lines for Pradhan indicate the sound or the energy that exists in the surroundings all the time.
About using a pitta artist pen, he says, “I have enjoyed drawing and painting since my childhood and using a pitta artist pen helps me revisit that feeling of happiness and sense of freedom.”
So many things happening on the canvas with the use of vibrant colours gives a sense of excitement to the viewers. Though referencing artists like Pollock, MF Husain, Picasso and more, his pen strokes give a sense of newness through his expression and thoughts about his life experiences.
In his paintings, these bright colours and motifs are in harmony and are visual treats that can surely cheer up the mood of any visitor. Moreover, you can also get free stickers from the artist.
If you too are in a gloomy mood and want to uplift a little, visit the exhibition that continues till February 6."

","Entrepreneurship education is not just an investment in the education system; it is an investment in the nation’s future prosperity. Photo: Pexels/ Rodnae Productions
In the shadow of the towering Himalayas, Nepal faces a challenge that rivals the steepness of its mountainous terrain- the challenge of economic development. As the nation earnestly pursues its Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), it becomes increasingly evident that a transformation in the education system is not only necessary but also urgent. 
Rooted in common living strategies, the prevailing education model, especially in higher education, may not adequately prepare the youth for the demands of the modern world. 
In this critical juncture, the incorporation of entrepreneurship education emerges as a beacon of hope, offering a pathway towards a self-reliant and prosperous Nepal.
Time to reevaluate the education system
Nepal’s journey towards economic prosperity has been marked by challenges that demand innovative solutions. The commitment of the SDGs reflects not only a global responsibility but also a domestic imperative for sustainable development. For this, it is high time to reevaluate the education system in the country.
The current education system in Nepal, deeply entrenched in common living strategies, has been the foundation of learning for generations. However, in the face of a rapidly evolving world, today’s generation aspires for more than the status quo. The call for independence reverberates through the aspirations of youth who seek a curriculum fostering critical thinking, innovation and entrepreneurial skills.
Entrepreneurship education is a dynamic force capable of reshaping Nepal’s educational landscape. This innovative approach moves beyond traditional learning methods, providing students with the tools to navigate the complexities of the modern world. At its core, entrepreneurship education is about empowering students to implement learned information in practical and tangible ways.
Consider a student engrossed in the intricacies of sensor systems during a science class, entrepreneurship education transforms this theoretical knowledge into practical applications, inspiring the creation of a sensor-operated door. Such innovation born from a fusion of science and entrepreneurship becomes a valuable mindset in solving practical problems.  
Expanding the horizons of entrepreneurship education, let us delve into chemistry. Imagine students studying chemistry not just as a theoretical subject, but also as entrepreneurs in the making. Armed with entrepreneurial principles, these students can tap into Nepal’s rich biodiversity, exploring market demands for products derived from local plants.
In the scenario, chemistry students could embark on a journey to develop performance-enhancing products based on market demand, harnessing the potential of indigenous flora. What makes this approach remarkable is that it does not necessarily require sophisticated machines or extensive human resources. Instead, it leverages the inherent skills and awareness of individuals within the community, paving the way for a grassroots economic revolution.
Entrepreneurship in education

The beauty of entrepreneurship education lies in its universal applicability. It is not confined to science or chemistry alone. Consider an art student, for example. Through entrepreneurship education, they can understand what art to develop (product), how much to set the price (price), where to sell (place) and how to sell (promote) their artworks. Every subject becomes a canvas for innovation and enterprise.
Moreover, entrepreneurship education is a powerful equaliser, recognising the unique skills and talents of individuals across various disciplines. It is not about fitting into a predefined mould but rather about unleashing the potential within each student. When every single person is aware of their skills and potential, they can rise to different levels, contributing to the overall progress of the nation.
Entrepreneurship education goes beyond skill recognition; it is about nurturing the ability to produce goods and mastering the art of marketing. Returning to the example of the student developing a sensor-operated door, entrepreneurship education not only equips them to produce the product but also teaches them how to navigate the complexities of marketing it to potential users and clients.
The impact of entrepreneurship education extends beyond individual success stories; it reverberates through the entire nation. A generation equipped with entrepreneurial skills becomes a driving force for economic growth and independence. They will be able to recognise the resources and ideas to utilise them to reach the global market. They will be able to be the pioneers in products and contribute to the economy. By fostering a culture of innovation, creativity and self-reliance, Nepal can reduce its dependence on external sources and strengthen its economy from within.
In essence, entrepreneurship education is not just an investment in the education system; it is an investment in the nation’s future prosperity. It is a transformative force that has the potential to shape a generation of independent thinkers, innovators and entrepreneurs- the architects of a self-reliant and economically vibrant Nepal. Entrepreneurship education, by teaching students to utilise available resources (physical and financial) and make them commercial, becomes a cornerstone in the nation’s journey towards economic empowerment and independence."

","Ram Bujhaun Yadav with his land ownership certificate stands near a border pillar which he says was erroneously placed on his land. 
In October 2023, when 51-year-old Ram Bujhaun Yadav of Musaharnia Rural Municipality-5, Mukhiyapatti, Dhanusha, was at a relative’s house, someone told him that two Indian Sashastra Seema Bal (SSB) personnel were looking for him.
Anxious, he rushed home wondering why they were looking for him.
“They asked me if the paddy field in the no man’s land was mine. I told them yes and they asked me to cut down the paddy immediately,” he said.
The paddy was not ripe and Yadav asked them for some time. However, the SSB personnel told him he had to cut down his paddy immediately.
Ram Bujhaun and his wife Tetari Devi each own a 677-square-metre plot of land. As Nepal and India reevaluated the border, Ram Bujhan’s land was been deemed to be near the no man’s land as it now has two demarcation pillars.
Frustrated, Ram Bujhaun cut the paddy before it was due to be harvested. Now, he has been asked to not plant anything on the land as it falls in the no man’s land.
“Our border police don’t say a word. I can’t fight the SSB on my own,” says Ram Bujhaun adding he had decided not to plan anything on the land anymore.
Woes of the farmers
Many farmers in southern Nepal say their land has now been placed in India after the recent demarcation. 
When the Jamuna River, which flows through the no man’s land between Nepal and India, changed its course some two decades ago, some border pillars went missing. Locals say these pillars have now been placed encroaching on Nepali land.
In 2018, with the then Chief District Officer of Dhanusha, Pradeep Raj Kandel, and an official from Madhubani district, Bihar, India, a team that included border security forces from both countries, the Armed Police Force of Nepal, and SSB of India began placing border pillars after land measurement by technicians.
Locals have raised concerns, stating that border pillars have been positioned, encroaching approximately 50 to 100 meters of land into Nepal compared to the previous position. Many like Ram Bujhaun are unaware of when these border pillars were placed.
“I did not know that pillar was placed here. After I found out when I asked the village leaders, many said they were placing the border pillars as they pleased,” said Ram Bujhaun.
He was told to carry on planting paddy and that it would not matter as these issues had happened in the past. 
“They encroached on my land and have asked me not to plant anything. This is gross injustice,” he says.
Ram Bujhaun’s family owns a total of 4,000 square metres of land, with 2,000 square metres belonging to him and the remaining 2,000 square metres to his brother Bechan. However, 1,000 square metres of his land is now located on the Indian side after the demarcation. Despite this, he has been farming on the land and continues to pay taxes to the Department of Land Management and Archive in Nepal.
“They have marked my land to be on the Indian side and placed border pillars on it. I’ve been farming till now but I don’t know when they will ask me to stop,” he says.
Ignorance of the government
The Madhesh province in southern Nepal
The former ward chair of Mukhiyapatti Musharniya Rural Municipality-5, Ram Naresh Yadav, said that over time, India has encroached on numerous Nepali lands in various locations in the Madhesh Province. This, he says, happened due to the Nepali administration’s ignorance and weak stature.
“They (Nepali administration) were careless and that meant the Indian side placed these border pillars by encroaching on Nepali land,” says Ram Naresh.
He said that over 40 farmers from wards 1, 5, and 6 have land ranging from 300 to 1,600 square metres on the Indian side. 
“These farmers have land ownership certificates, but they cannot farm as the SSB says the land is in India and not Nepal,” said Ram Naresh.
In 1996, land ownership certificates were distributed after surveying the land in the border area. Local Dharmendra Kumar Yadav said that since then, the locals have been paying their land tax regularly. In 2018, when the pillar was being placed, the locals protested when they saw their land was being encroached on. However, since the demarcation had been agreed upon by high-ranking government officials of Nepal and India, the farmer’s voices went unheard.
“We tried to stop when the border pillars were being placed on our land. But the administrators from both sides forcibly put it there without even trying to hold a discussion,” said Harish Chandra Yadav. 
The Chief District Officer of Dhanusha, Chakrapani Pandey, says that the border pillars were placed by the technical team after the measurements and with the agreement of the high-ranking officials of the two countries.
“The fields and houses that are built in no man’s land have recently been cleared. No one can do anything in this particular area,” said Pandey. “We understand the people’s concern but we cannot do anything about it now.”"

","Regenerative braking representational image. Photo: Freepik
The electric vehicle market in Nepal has grown significantly over the past year. 
Electric four-wheelers and two-wheelers are being launched almost every month, spanning from passenger to commercial vehicles. Electric transportation appears to be an emerging trend in the automotive industry.
New EVs are regularly introduced with advanced features as car companies develop unique electric platforms. One standout feature is regenerative braking.
Regenerative braking was first introduced in 1967 by the American Motor Car Company (AMC) in their prototype electric vehicle, the AMC Amitron. However, Toyota became the automobile manufacturer to implement regenerative braking system (RBS) technology in their Prius series hybrid vehicles in 1997. Toyota brought up the new hybrid technology in the Prius when fuel prices were going up at a massive rate.

But what is regenerative braking? There are still many people confused about what it is, whether it is safe or helpful in fuel economy in hybrid cars and the regeneration of electricity in electric cars.
In simple terms, regen braking is when a car saves energy by recharging its battery when you brake, helping it use less fuel or electricity and go further. Easy but scientifically, regen braking is a process used in vehicles where the kinetic energy produced during braking is converted into electrical energy through an electric motor acting as a generator. This electrical energy is then stored in the vehicle’s battery for later use, reducing energy wastage and increasing overall efficiency.
Photo: Freepik
Regen braking can be seen in all kinds of EVs, including cars, scooters, commercial vans, buses, bicycles, three-wheelers, and rickshaws. It now can be electrically managed to what extent the power and braking can be generated. 
Regenerative Braking work process in EV

Principle of Operation: Regene braking works by turning the energy from slowing down into electricity.
Electric Motor as a Generator: In EV or hybrid cars with regen braking, the motor changes roles from moving the car to making electricity when you brake.
Switching Polarity: When you brake, the motor switches directions, turning energy from the wheels into electricity instead of using it to move the car.
Generation of Electricity: The turning wheels make the motor produce electricity, which goes to the car’s battery.
Power Electronics: Special electronics change the electricity from the motor into the right kind for charging the battery.
Battery Charging: The electricity made during braking charges up the car’s battery, storing the energy for later.
Integration with Hydraulic Braking System: Regenerative braking works with the regular brakes, blending them for smooth stopping.

Advantages and Disadvantages of Regenerative Braking 
The advantages are listed below:

Energy Efficiency: Regenerative braking efficiently captures the kinetic energy generated during braking, effectively reducing energy wastage and contributing to a more sustainable driving experience.
Extended Range: By using the energy that would otherwise be lost during braking as heat and sound, regenerative braking helps to extend the driving range of electric vehicles in instances such as travelling downhill. 
Reduced Brake Wear: Regenerative braking minimizes the strain on traditional braking components, mitigating wear and tear, and potentially extending the lifespan of the braking components such as brake pads, rotors and brake lines, thus reducing maintenance costs over time.
Enhanced Driving Experience: Regenerative braking provides a smoother braking experience and a more responsive feel to drivers, enhancing overall driving comfort and control on the road.

The disadvantages are listed below:

Limited Effectiveness at Low Speeds: While regenerative braking efficiently recaptures energy during braking, its effectiveness diminishes at lower speeds which leads to decreased energy recovery compared to higher speeds.
Complexity and Cost: Implementing regenerative braking adds complexity and cost to vehicle systems, potentially raising manufacturing and maintenance expenses, and impacting consumer affordability.
Maintenance Requirements: Regenerative braking systems require periodic maintenance and calibration to ensure they operate optimally.
Efficiency Variability: Regenerative braking may exhibit variability in efficiency under extreme weather conditions or on certain road surfaces, leading to fluctuations in overall energy recapture and impacting the vehicle’s efficiency.

Misconceptions

Fully Recharges Battery: Some mistakenly believe that regenerative braking fully replenishes the battery, but in reality, it only adds a modest amount of charge.
Increases Braking Distances: There is a misconception that regenerative braking extends braking distances, but it enhances braking performance by complementing traditional brakes.
High-Speed Only: While more effective at higher speeds, regenerative braking still functions at lower speeds, such as during city driving or stop-and-go traffic.
Maintenance-Free: Despite requiring less maintenance than traditional brakes, regen braking systems still need periodic checks and maintenance to ensure proper operation.
Significantly Boosts Range: While regen braking contributes to extending the driving range of electric vehicles, its impact is influenced by various factors beyond just braking efficiency.
Only for Electric Cars: Although commonly associated with electric vehicles, regen braking systems are also found in some conventional vehicles, particularly those aiming to improve fuel efficiency with advanced technology.

Regenerative braking might sound complicated, but it is pretty cool. Think of it as a way for EVs and hybrids to recycle energy when they slow down. Instead of just wasting that energy, regenerative braking turns it into electricity, which can then be used to power the battery."

Emerging Team’s Asia Cup: India A humiliate Nepal to send them packing
","The snow leopard rescued from Urlabari is currently being kept at the Central Zoo in Lalitpur. Photo: Aryan Dhimal
As the gates to the vet clinic at the Central Zoo in Lalitpur opened, more than two dozen photojournalists thronged the facility and surrounded a metal cage aiming their DSLR cameras at a snow leopard inside.
“Please don’t come close to the animal,” the zoo’s vet, Radha Krishna Gharti, told approaching photojournalists. But in the gush of excitement to take exclusive photographs of the elusive cat, difficult to spot even in its prime habitats, there were few takers for the word of caution.
Nepal’s Department of National Parks and Wildlife Conservation (DNPWC) organised the photo-op two days after the male subadult cat, which was until recently found in the country only at altitudes higher than 2,000-6,000 metres above sea level, was brought to the zoo from Urlabari town(146 m above sea level). According to the department, the animal has sustained injuries to its right foreleg and cannot stand upright.
Although officials involved said they are looking at releasing the animal into the wild after it recuperates, doing so will be a daunting task, adding that the zoo may be the only place where it can now survive.
Not a wild cat

“Nepali snow leopard experts have come up with two hypotheses to explain how the animal from the mountains landed up in the plains,” said Sharad Chandra Adhikari, member-secretary at the National Trust for Nature Conservation (NTNC), a semi-government body that manages the zoo in Lalitpur, a town in the Kathmandu Valley. 
The first of the two hypotheses made public during the photo-op-cum-press conference, is that it was raised in captivity and somehow managed to escape into the wild. The second is that it lost its orientation while trying to establish its territory after separating from its mother.
Kulbhushansingh Suryawanshi, director of the India program, Snow Leopard Trust, said that both hypotheses are plausible explanations as to how the snow leopard got to the plains in Nepal.
A DNPWC official, who wished to remain anonymous as he is not authorised to talk to the press, said that it was more likely that the animal had been raised in captivity. 
“The way it sipped the water and ate the food zoo staff offered indicates that it may have been raised in captivity,” the official said.
Snow leopards are shy cats living at extreme altitudes in the steep mountainous areas of 12 countries in Central and South Asia. Their global population spread over altitudes of 500-5,800 m, is estimated to be between around 3,900 and 6,000 as detailed coordinated surveys of the population in the range countries are yet to be carried out. In Nepal, their population divided into three blocks (eastern, central and western) is estimated to be between 301 and 400.
Adhikari from NTNC said that researchers will now examine the animal’s scat to analyse its diet and try to find out whether it was roaming in the wild or had been in some sort of captivity. Researchers are also preparing to analyse its genes to try to find out to which of the three metapopulations in Nepal it belongs. They will also observe the animal’s canine teeth and fur to look for clues.
Relocation challenge

The whole process could take a few months to complete, and summer could set in in Kathmandu by then, officials concede. 
“The current temperature in Kathmandu is suitable for snow leopards, as we are in the peak of winter,” said Madhu Chetri, a snow leopard researcher from NTNC. But that could change as spring season begins in the Northern Hemisphere.
The DNPWC official said that regardless of the findings related to how the animal got to Urlabarli, the animal would have spent a significant amount of time with humans during its recovery phase. “That would mean that it would have gotten habituated with having humans around,” the official said.
Sending such animals back into the wild is a challenge, as they may have lost their hunting and other adaptation skills, he added. In May last year, officials at the Chitwan National Park released two rescued rhino calves into the wild, with limited success. The safety of the animals, which had gotten used to having humans around, was compromised as poachers could easily approach and kill them. Eventually, they were transferred to an enclosure in eastern Nepal away from human intervention.
Veteran conservationist Professor Karan Bahadur Shah said that rewilding the snow leopard would be a daunting task, as the animals are territorial. “If we just leave the animal in its natural habitat, it will get killed by other snow leopards defending their territory,” he said. “The best option would be to keep the animal in the zoo for the public to see.”
But Nepal’s Central Zoo has its own set of problems. The facility, established in 1932 as a private collection, has limited space and has frequently run into financial trouble. Conservationists say the snow leopard would need special facilities to cater to its needs.
“If the government decides that the snow leopard needs to remain at the zoo, we are ready to shoulder the responsibility,” said Adhikari. “We have set up special facilities for animals such as the red panda and chimpanzees,” he said. “We can do that for the snow leopard as well.”
Those advocating for keeping the animal in the zoo also said that Nepal is a snow leopard range country and the public, especially the young generation, also needs to see the different animals found in the country. “It has great educational value,” said Shah.
Snow leopard expert Suryawanshi from neighbouring India also said that it would be challenging to release the animal into the wild. 
“If the team at the zoo can establish the exact cause of this behaviour [why it ventured into the plains] and can keep the animal away from human contact, then it might be okay to release it back,” he said. “But otherwise, there is little hope for it in the wild. Better to let it live in the zoo.”
Back at the zoo, after the photojournalists are done taking photos, it is the turn of the reporters to point their smartphones at the animal. Then there is a contingent of senior wildlife department officials waiting in line to catch a glimpse of the animal. 
“So much for keeping it away from human contact,” a conservationist observing the hullabaloo from a distance said.

Nepal beat Bangladesh on penalties to win FIFA International Women’s Football Series
","The National Assembly was formed to give experienced people a chance to be part of the parliament and help during the formation of important bills. In countries that follow the Westminster model of government, the upper house plays an important role. That, however, is not the case in Nepal as the country’s upper house has become a platform where individuals secure positions in the National Assembly based on their connections. As the election nears, many once again question the relevance and existence of the upper house.
Things were different in the past as the initial years of the National Assembly saw experienced politicians and experts others in their field be nominated for the post. That slowly changed as the first batch completed its two-year term.
“I understand why people are frustrated with the upper house. People expected experts but all we got was party cadres who lacked knowledge or experience,” says Bimala Rai Paudyal a National Assembly member. “Considering such behaviour and practices, what distinguishes the House of Representatives from the National Assembly?”
A loser’s second chance 
Narayan Kaji Shrestha, who faced defeat in the 2017 general election from Gorkha-2, was elected as a member of the National Assembly on January 23, 2020. Elected from Gandaki Province, Shrestha currently is the Deputy Prime Minister and Home Minister of the country.
Bhagwati Neupane who lost the election from Gandaki province and Bimala Ghimire who lost the election for mayorship in Bhanu Municipality also shared the same trajectory.
Similarly, Mrigendra Kumar Singh Yadav and Jag Prasad Sharma were defeated in the House of Representatives elections, from Saptari-4 and Dang-3 respectively are now members of the National Assembly. Bam Dev Gautam, who lost the elections from Bardiya, secured a place in the upper house through nomination by President Bidya Devi Bhandari.
Even those who did not win as ward member(s) got the opportunity to become members of the National Assembly including Sindh Bahadur Bishwakarma who was appointed on February 7, 2018. He is soon leaving his post on March 3.
Despite the repeated criticisms, the political parties have not paid attention to this concern posed by political leaders and the general public. The latest proof of this is the list of candidates for the National Assembly elections scheduled on January 25. The list contains names like Krishna Prasad Sitaula, defeated in the House of Representatives elections in 2022 from Koshi Province, and Pooja Chaudhary, who lost in the provincial assembly elections 2022 from Rautahat-3 (a).
Speaker Ganesh Prasad Timilsina, who led the National Assembly for the entire six years under the federal system, is also dissatisfied with the individuals who have made it to the upper house. 
“The allegations are something for the parties to ponder upon. The leaders should have prioritised involving intellectuals/neutrals rather than managing its members,” he says.
The 59-member National Assembly elects eight representatives, equally from all seven provinces, with an additional three individuals nominated by the President. The Constitution ensures representation of women, Dalits, minorities or disabled communities, envisioning that experts, experienced individuals, and the most qualified people from various fields will become members of the National Assembly.
Easy way in
File: A National Assembly meeting
There are some reasons why leaders aspire to join the upper house, and even the leadership create opportunities for them. 
In National Assembly elections, voters consist of local-level heads/deputy heads and provincial assembly members. Typically, individuals seeking these positions undergo a vetting process by their respective parties. As a result, aspiring members of parliament can focus less on persuading individual voters and more on gaining party support to secure their candidacy. 
Moreover, being a member of the National Assembly opens avenues to ministerial roles. The constitution prohibits a National Assembly member from becoming the Prime Minister, but not Deputy Prime Minister. Due to such opportunities, leaders are enticed to seek a position in the assembly.
The National Assembly is currently in its fourth election cycle since the promulgation of the Consitution in 2015. Scheduled for January 25, this election aims to fill 19 seats vacated by individuals completing their six-year terms. The previous election cycles took place in 2017, involving 56 members, followed by 2019 with 18 positions, and 2020 with 19 positions.
The cascading impacts
File: A National Assembly meeting
Another reason why the National Assembly is finding it difficult to justify itself is that it has become a shadow of the House of Representatives. The meeting of the National Assembly did not have one session when the House of Representatives was dissolved by then Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli twice. The demands and issues raised by the opposition parties in the House of Representatives automatically went to the National Assembly, where the parliamentarians of the ruling party put forward any proposal, they endorse it the same as in the House of Representatives.
The latest example – is the main opposition UML did not allow the meeting of the House of Representatives to continue for five days from July 5, 2023, due to a statement made by Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal during his visit to India. Consequently, the meeting of the National Assembly was also paused during that period.
The UML obstructed the House of Representatives for almost a month starting mid-July last year demanding a high-level inquiry committee to probe the 60-kilogram gold smuggling case and the resignation of the Home Minister. The National Assembly followed suit with leaders pushing their agendas forward.
Speaker Ganesh Timilsina himself is dissatisfied that every behaviour and activity of the House of Representatives influence the National Assembly. He says despite his attempts to prevent the overshadowing, it has been unfortunate that he did not garner the goodwill of the top leaders during political disputes.
Reinstating power
The National Assembly is a permanent institution. Therefore, it can remain operational even in the absence of the House of Representatives. Under normal circumstances, Speaker Timilsina initiated a positive practice by personally participating in different committees. Nevertheless, in the absence of the House of Representatives, the National Assembly often experienced inactivity.
In December 2020, the Prime Minister at that time, KP Sharma Oli, dissolved the House of Representatives. Subsequently, a session of the National Assembly was convened on January 1, 2021. Despite lasting only seven hours over four days, this session, which took place after the dissolution, failed to address crucial public issues. Even after six months, important matters remained unaddressed within the House.
On May 22, 2021, the UML-led government once again dissolved the House of Representatives. The meeting of the National Assembly and committees was affected once more. However, the dissolutions were declared unconstitutional by the Supreme Court, reinstating the parliament.
The Constitution says that despite the closing of the National Assembly session, thematic committee meetings can still take place. However, both the National Assembly and its committees remained inactive until the restoration of the House of Representatives.
According to Khimlal Devkota, a member of the National Assembly, when the House of Representatives was dissolved twice, it seemed that the National Assembly was also in a state of dissolution.
Bimala Rai Paudyal also believes that the inability to resume the upper house is a mark of weakness. 
“Since the government was not in a position to call, the President needed to be consulted by the chair together with the consultation committee. That was not done either,” she says.
Constitutional and legal distinctions

Except for the Constitution of Nepal (1962) and the Interim Constitution of Nepal (2007), all other constitutions in Nepal provided for a bicameral parliament with the National Assembly or the Upper House and the House of Representatives or the Lower House. The practices before 2015 were under the unitary governance system, but after the adoption of the federal democratic republican governance system, the role of the National Assembly has changed somewhat.
In the preamble of the constitution prepared by the ‘Constituent Assembly, and Administrative Organ Designation Committee’ during the drafting of the constitution, it is mentioned that some different qualifications have been prescribed for being a member of the House of Representatives and the National Assembly, with the intention that qualified people can be represented in the National Assembly.
Chair of the National Assembly Ganesh Prasad Timilsina restates that the members of the upper house should be assessed based on the country’s expectations with clear criteria. 
There is no definite definition of an expert in the constitution. It has been stated symbolically, “…It is expected that the members should have some basic skills to face the challenges and fulfil their responsibilities.”
According to the constitution, the responsibility of the National Assembly is to correctly establish the rights of the local level, state, and union, and to prevent the House of Representatives from trying to enact laws contrary to the spirit of federalism. There is an explanatory comment in the constitution about the propriety of the National Assembly – “This House is expected to fulfil its role to maintain creative and mutual relations between the national government and the provinces.”
In addition, there are some constitutional and legal differences regarding the National Assembly. But the MPs are demanding that it should cease. When a bill originating in the House of Representatives is passed and sent to the National Assembly, and if the latter does not decide within 60 days, it proceeds de facto.
This has placed the National Assembly in a dilemma. The Chairman of the National Assembly, Timilsina, says, “Such an arrangement should also apply to the House of Representatives, or both should be equal.”
Need for course correction 
PM Pushpa Kamal Dahal speaking in the National Assembly meeting.
Some instances have turned these so-called experts into a laughing stock due to their actions. 
On July 5, 2023,  a discussion on the Electronic Commerce (E-Commerce) Bill 2023 was tabled in the National Assembly. However, the parliamentarians misunderstood the main point and instead discussed the matter of electricity. The MPs, who had not read the proposal, suggested that electricity consumption within Nepal should also be increased besides exporting electricity to India and Bangladesh.
During the meeting, Ramesh Rijal, the Minister of Industry, Commerce and Supplies, also mentioned that India would purchase electricity during the Prime Minister’s visit. Unfortunately, the bill was unanimously approved.
Timilsina considers the incident an example, that in his six-year tenure, he does not want to remember. Som Bahadur Thapa, a former secretary at the Parliament Secretariat, termed the incident ‘a joke’ in the Parliament of Nepal. 
“This is strong proof of the kind of MPs we have, who speak without knowing what they are talking about.” 
Timilsina assumed the role of the speaker/chair of the National Assembly after the establishment of the Federal Democratic Republic. He had the opportunity to establish the system and the dignity of the National Assembly. However, instead of setting a positive example, he will soon be retiring after being accused of playing tricks with the Speaker and showing interest in the work of the House of Representatives.
Timilsina has repeatedly commented on the affairs of the House of Representatives. The latest instance was during a seminar on ‘Japan: Past, Present, and Future’ held in the capital on December 2, 2023, he publicly stated that the election results of the House of Representatives did not bode well.
Pointing to the emergence of a new party and the victory of some independent candidates, he said, “In a democracy, you get to choose candidates, irrespective of their party affiliation. However, is the signal positive?”
In August/ September 2022, Timilsina wrote a letter to the Election Commission, urging them to extend the tenure of Speaker and Deputy Speaker. Upon receiving a response stating that the Commission would not determine the tenure of the elected Parliament, Timilsina directed the Parliament Secretariat not to execute decisions made by the Management Committee after September 17, 2022.
This created conflict between the Speaker of the House of Representatives and the Speaker of the National Assembly and in the crux of this dispute between the parties, the country had to bear the consequences of this conflict. Laws could not be enacted promptly, and the place once considered the domain of experts was overshadowed by the party’s interest. 
A study conducted by the Democracy Resource Center Nepal (DRCN) on the legislative functioning of the National Assembly has revealed that the Upper House has passed some bills that go against the spirit of federalism.
The report’s concluding remarks say, “…the bills passed by the House of Representatives have not undergone significant changes or discussions in the National Assembly. The conclusion section of the study states that – “Furthermore, some bills, contradicting the spirit of federalism and addressing the interests of interest groups, have been approved by the National Assembly.”
Overall, in the last six years, parties have introduced individuals who, given their presentation level, have raised questions about the National Assembly’s justification. If there are no changes in the constitution, laws, and policies concerning the upper assembly, these concerns will persist.”"

While most of the nation was preparing for the festival of lights, Tihar in early November 2023, something no less exciting was fuelling our sparks from oceans away. A queer art festival was happening for the seventeenth year and we had a chance to attend it as delegates. Our delegation was made possible through the collaboration between the Outburst Arts, an art organisation based in Northern Ireland, UK and the British Council, Nepal.
There is a clear distinction between cities in terms of their flourishing arts scenes, and this became apparent during a visit to Belfast, Northern Ireland, specifically for the Outburst Queer Arts Festival held in the charming city centre. The organisation of such a festival requires months of careful preparation and planning.
The queer art festival started as short events lasting a few days. Now, after 17 years, it has grown into a ten-day festival with panel discussions, theatre performances, and exhibitions. Program guides were available at venues, partner hotels, local libraries, and shops. Many delegates, including us, came from outside Northern Ireland to attend.
During the queer art festival, we had the opportunity to connect with art curators, publishers, artists, and representatives from other British Council departments around the world (Lithuania, France, South Africa, Turkey, Greece, Jordan, England, and Argentina to name a few.) 
Each event that we attended gave us a different insight into what the arts can do and how it can facilitate connections. We gained insights from queer publishers and art curators on the challenges they face in their own countries due to resources and sometimes from bureaucracy in systems. We also got to see the way people can thrive when given a platform to showcase their works, such as an art exhibition in which the artist reimagined intimacy for queer people.
On the other hand, Nepal struggles by and large at times for queer visibility. There are no explicit spaces for SOGIESC (Sexual Orientation, Gender Identity and Expressions and Sex Characteristics) artists to showcase their works nor openly come together as a community, it all exists in pocket spaces. In the same way, something that struck us was the presence of older queer artists at the festival. 
It was not just for one particular event during the queer art festival. We noticed an active participation and involvement of older queer people throughout the festival there. It was fascinating to see queer artists in their 40s and 50s share their transformative and inspiring work. Whereas, back home, the queer folks at the forefront of queer art, advocacy and activism are mostly Gen-Zs and millennials. We have very few queer elders that we can count on our fingers who are diligently working for Nepali queer folks. Even among them, some still hold onto archaic notions and refuse to evolve and embrace changes. So, there’s that.
From dream to reality

Before being selected as delegates, both of us joined online meetings with British Council Nepal and the Outburst representatives facilitated through Kaalo 101 (an art space in Patan), along with interested queer artists from Nepal. We had a total of three meetings where we discussed the possibilities and challenges of doing a queer art festival in Nepal. 
The discourse also entailed us sharing a presentation about the updates of the queer art scene in Nepal in the last five years. The updates included memorable leaps taken in queer arts from music to literature and fashion and more by artists from diverse walks of life. Days after the third meeting, the British Council extended invitations to us to attend the Outburst Queer Arts Festival.
Our delegation is just one example of the transcontinental collaboration because it was something that happened for the first time and involved us. But, Outburst Arts and the British Council have been practising cross-continental collaboration for years. Even in this year’s festival, we witnessed a lot of artists from different continents work together in exhibitions, lectures, panel discussions, magazines and so on. The amalgamation introduced us to brilliant thought-provoking work that defies gender and sociopolitical norms. The power of transcontinental collaboration was beyond beautiful.
Imagining queer arts in Nepal

The queer art scene in Nepal is an emerging one. While a full-fledged festival may not be possible now, something small yet significant is achievable. Time and again, different organisations have been running large art exhibitions/tours for weeks and months. However, in the microcosm that is Nepal, especially Kathmandu, the capital is no stranger to art-oriented programs. What it has been unfamiliar with precisely is queer art. And the unfamiliarity is not something induced by the lack of queer artists and their art. Sadly, it is because of inadequate platforms, space and resources to pursue queer arts.
Despite this, through the years there have been events and literature that have emerged centring on queer identity, but it has not come without its challenges. On collections of stories, “Pride Climbing Higher” and “Songs of Revolution” showcase stories from Nepalis across Nepal. There are not many stories reflecting the Nepali queer experiences otherwise. 
June Pride Parade by Queer Youth Group has gained momentum as well in the past few years since its conception, from a small gathering to now a large parade with performances from community members. The same can be said about Blue Diamond Society’s (BDS) Rainbow Visibility Pride events in August during the festival of Saa-Paru (Gai Jatra) which has been running for well over a decade; in recent years they have included flash mobs and interaction programmes as well in lead up to their parade. Individuals within the community have also organised their queer gatherings with friends, thus coming back to the cosmos of pocket spaces in celebrating queerness.
While artists like us are creative with what we want to put out, we still need organisations like the British Council to foster spaces and connections to enable us to do that. Then and again, artists have come together and collaborated on queer-centric projects. But, we need funding and resources to achieve bigger-scale projects that unite more artists and transcend borders.
Both of us advocate for queer rights and are involved in programs and activities that push the narrative further, extend the visibility of the community and normalise conversations surrounding queerness. Among other things, we are also the founders of Queering The Bond, a networking collective for Nepali queer folks and Shuby is also the founder of Queer Honky-Tonk, a platform to promote queer performances and networking with events such as a drag show or open mic every few months. However, both of us, individually or collaboratively can only do so much. 

The challenges of living in a capitalistic world oftentimes outweigh the passion we have for the queer art scene in Nepal. And this is where we expect the government and organisations to step up with policies, platforms and programs to provide spaces, opportunities and resources for queer artists. Here, the British Council joined hands with Outburst Arts, which paved the way for our delegation. We would not have known about the marvellous queer art festival at the other end of the world otherwise.
Besides the limitations brought by insufficient spaces and social unawareness, the centralised capital does hinder queer artists from outside the city to connect, create and collaborate. Art already is centralised and elitist. On top of that, the concentrated Kathmandu Valley is of no help when it comes to making art accessible beyond its borders.
Furthermore, there is also the expectation from basically everyone to have the perfect festival that caters to all people’s needs and wants. While the festival, if it should happen, is bound to be done with the right intentions, there is a lot of pressure for the first-time event itself. The festival will be inclusive and diverse. But, realistically speaking, it would be a struggle to make it relevant to each queer person from east to west.
Speaking of struggles, a visceral feeling of uneasiness swarmed over me with each step I took while exiting the airport after the flight back home. I, Birat, personally felt that I could not be as free or unrestrained in Nepal as I was during my time in Belfast. No wonder a lot of the queer people we know opt for abroad.
Seventeen years ago, when the Outburst Queer Arts Festival first began, it certainly was not as celebrated or large as it is now. What we are trying to convey here is that we do not have to start big. We can aim for something small yet promising. While there might be expectations to check all the boxes, it is crucial to be mindful of our capacity as well. But, we can be capacitated and this is where you – people in power, art enthusiasts, grant and resource allocators and media come in. It is time we all believe in Nepali queer art and create space for it to not only survive but thrive. It is imperative to understand that formulating our imagination into reality can only be possible through unwavering collaboration."

Tyson Moktan: The powerlifting pioneer in the country wants to pave the way for the future
","The month of January saw major road accidents in different parts of the country, including Lamhi in Dang, Dhorpatan in Baglung, and Chandragiri in Kathmandu. Road accidents have been common throughout the country with Nepal Police data suggesting over 2,500 people dying in them annually. Despite this, the Ministry of Finance has shown reluctance to introduce the proposed Road Safety Bill to reduce traffic accidents, fatalities, and serious injuries, and enhance road safety. 
Instead, the Finance Ministry has asked the Ministry of Physical Infrastructure and Transport to include the proposed bill in the Public Roads Act. Along with that, the government’s initiative to pass dedicated laws on road safety and set up a mechanism, including the empowered National Road Safety Council (NRSC), to decrease accidents, has come to a halt.
Keshav Kumar Sharma, secretary of the Ministry of Physical Infrastructure and Transport, says they asked for a dedicated road safety law that comprehensively addresses institutional arrangements was the need of the hour. This includes ensuring safety in road construction, promoting public awareness, providing training and communication facilities, implementing rescue mechanisms, and arranging rehabilitation for families affected by road accidents. However, the Ministry of Finance believes a separate law is unnecessary due to concerns about potential increased financial burden.
Hourly need

Officials from the Ministry of Physical Infrastructure allege that the Ministry of Finance is approaching sensitive matters, such as passenger safety, solely from an economic standpoint. They say that concerns related to road, vehicle, and passenger safety are being overshadowed, and there are indications that this approach will continue. 
“The government is avoiding addressing the sensitive issue of road accidents and the associated human and material costs, fearing an increase in expenses. This contradicts the government’s commitment and policy to reduce traffic accidents in the future,” says an official from the Ministry of Physical Infrastructure on the condition of anonymity.
According to the Ministry of Physical Infrastructure, the existing laws lack the vision and purpose necessary for developing a sustainable, safe, risk-free, and reliable transportation operation and security system. Therefore, the Ministry of Physical Infrastructure officials argue that a distinct law is essential to decrease road accidents and ensure the safety of pedestrians, including passenger transport workers and roadside residents, as well as pets, wild animals, and birds. 
“The Road Safety Act is the need of the hour as it will help us during post-accident rescue, treatment management, rehabilitation, and legal representation,” says the official.
Currently, there are gaps in enforcing road rules, monitoring vehicle capacities, ensuring road structure safety, managing traffic signs, and organizing road safety facilities. The implementation of the Road Safety Act is seen as crucial to address these issues.
However, there has not been a facilitative environment for providing education and raising awareness about road traffic safety, safety mechanisms, and coordinating among organisations related to road transport. The aspect of training drivers with skills and knowledge, as well as monitoring road safety on the roads, is also lacking. This is why experts have been suggesting introducing a separate road safety law to address these aspects.
The Finance Ministry, however, says that road safety should not be downplayed by ignoring human sensibilities related to road safety and citing economic reasons. Officials from the Ministry of Physical Infrastructure argue that incorporating safety considerations in the Road Act does not automatically result in a decrease in accidents or the integration of post-accident rescue, relief, and rehabilitation efforts.
“The existing laws do not address road safety anywhere. Due to its lack of clarity and inadequacy, it has not been implemented with due diligence. For instance, provisions such as those for vehicle inspectors outlined in the Transport Act have not been acted upon by the government,” says an official from the Transport Ministry.
Policies and commitments, but no laws

The Motor Vehicles and Transport Management Act (1993) includes several provisions related to vehicle registration, road permits, driver’s licenses, traffic management, insurance, and penalties. The Public Roads Act (1974) primarily focuses on road management. However, there is no provision in the Act regarding the National Road Safety Council.
In this situation, Nepal has developed a 10-year road safety action plan but is yet to enact corresponding legislation. Unfortunately, government agencies and mechanisms are not obligated to follow the action plan, as it lacks legal guidance.
Now, the Transport Ministry holds the view that if safety considerations are explicitly addressed in the Public Roads Act, the outcome will not differ from what the Finance Ministry has said. Given the Public Roads Act’s close association with the Department of Road, the ministry thinks greater emphasis will be placed on road construction. However, they argue that incorporating the road safety aspect into the Act would not be effective.
Secretary Sharma of the Transport Ministry is tasked with ensuring road safety, overseeing physical infrastructure and transport, and coordinating efforts across education, health, home, law, federal affairs, and general administration ministries. This responsibility extends to provincial ministries, local levels, as well as various agencies, organisations, security agencies, non-governmental organisations, and related entities, each with their specific roles.
“As all the agencies need to be allocated responsibilities for various aspects of road safety, we have requested them to collaborate in formulating a distinct law. This should encompass the reduction of all types of accidents,” said Sharma.
The ministry believes that a dedicated law addressing road safety is crucial to mitigate severe road accidents in Nepal and to uphold the commitments made by the country on the international stage.
Nepal has committed to implementing the Stockholm Declaration through the Global Road Traffic Safety Conference in 2020, as per the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. Nepal, which has incorporated sustainable development goals into its national development plan, has not yet commenced work aligned with these objectives.

Nevertheless, Nepal’s neighbouring countries are already addressing road safety through legal frameworks. Various states in India have enacted road safety laws, and the effectiveness of these laws is contributing to a 50 per cent reduction in road accidents.
In 1999, Bhutan also introduced a unified road safety and transport act. Pakistan, on the other hand, issued the National Highway Safety Ordinance-2000 to ensure road safety, distinct from its National Highway Authority Act (1991). Britain, Australia, America, New Zealand, and other countries have established separate road safety laws as well.
Road safety neglected
In Nepal, road safety has been consistently neglected due to the absence of dedicated legislation. Road safety expert Keshav Adhikari says that the government primarily focused on road construction, overlooks crucial aspects such as road safety and reinforcement. Consequently, roads are transforming into perilous pathways for both vehicles and passengers.
“There is a lack of interest in formulating policies and laws aimed at mitigating financial losses resulting from accidents,” says Adhikari.
He further points out that safety is not a governmental priority, as expanding the road network is perceived to yield more political benefits than implementing additional structures to enhance road safety.
“When I worked as an expert in the Transport Ministry for over a year, I realised that promoting road safety is not a government priority,” he says. “Annually, more people die due to road accidents than those who die in natural disasters, but the government has not given it much attention.”
Even though the prime minister, ministers, and MPs keep asserting that roads have been constructed, no one seems to be addressing the critical issues of road safety and quality.
Saroj Sitaula, General Secretary of the Federation of Nepalese National Transport Entrepreneurs (FNNTE), says that the government must be attentive as accidents are on the rise due to various technical and human factors, including road infrastructure. 
“Many accidents can be mitigated by improving road conditions, installing barriers on the sides, putting up informational boards, and ensuring scientific and practical road markings,” he says. “We need to formulate a plan and progress accordingly.”
Sitaula argues that the government should establish policies to create mechanisms for emergency rescue, treatment, and rehabilitation after an accident occurs. He emphasises the importance of enhancing road infrastructure, conducting a scientific examination of the technical condition of vehicles, and ensuring compliance with the law by drivers, passengers, and regulators. He says that blaming drivers and transport entrepreneurs for accidents is inadequate, and the government must fulfil its responsibilities.
Roads are unsafe

Nepal currently boasts a road network spanning approximately 100,000 km, with the majority consisting of dirt and gravel roads. Among the more than 22,000 kilometres of national and subsidiary highways, numerous sections remain unpaved.
Despite the government’s substantial investment in road construction and expansion, minimal efforts are allocated to ensuring road safety. 
Recently, all three levels of government have accelerated the widening of roads, incorporating asphalt and slopes. However, it appears that issues concerning road quality and safety are escalating at a faster pace. Roads that have been neglected in the guise of maintenance have become a nightmare for the public.
Infrastructure expert Suryaraj Acharya notes that these problems arise due to the tendency to construct roads only after they have sustained damage, without considering potential issues during the initial construction phase."

Realme has launched its popular mid-range number series smartphone, the Realme 12 Pro series. The series includes the Realme 12 Pro 5G and the Realme 12 Pro+ 5G which are the successors of the Realme 11 Pro+ 5G and Realme 11 Pro 5G respectively. The Realme 11 series was widely appreciated for its design and performance at the price range. 
The 12 series has stepped up the game with an even better design. Realme has not only changed the design but has also upgraded the performance and the camera to compete in the mid-range price market. Realme recently has been focusing a lot on the design aspect and the price range performance. 
The 12 Pro+ has some major differences from last year’s 11 Pro+ which include design, IP rating, chipset, camera and charging. 
Let us see what the luxuriously designed smartphone delivers in terms of specs.
Specifications of Realme 12 Pro+ 5G

Design and Display
The Realme 12 Pro+ and the Realme 12 Pro share the same design and dimensions. The design is fascinating. Realme patterned up with Luxury Swiss Watch designer Ollivier Savéo to craftfully design the smartphone. 
All the colour options have a vegan leather back. Since the phone is designed by a luxury watch designer, it comes with a big round camera module housing the triple camera setup. There is a golden 3D Jubilee Bracelet which gives the texture of a luxury watch strap. A golden patterned line runs through the middle and around the camera module for an even better look.

Performance and Storage
The performance has also been stepped up with the change from MediaTek Chipset in the 11 Pro series to Snapdragon chipsets in the 12 Pro series. The Realme 12 Pro+ 5G is powered by the Snapdragon 7s Gen 2 chipset built on a 4nm processor. It has an octa-core CPU, which includes Cortex-A78 and Cortex-A55 cores for seamless multitasking and responsiveness. The Adreno 710 GPU handles the graphics for gaming and multimedia.

It runs on the Realme UI 5.0 based on Android 14. The overall software experience is good but Realme gets back to the cost-cutting techniques in the software part with a bunch load of pre-installed hot apps and hot games. It also has a 3D VC liquid cooling system which spans 3394mm² and covers the main heat sources of the motherboard giving a boost in heat dissipation efficiency.

Camera
The camera on the Realme 12 Pro+ 5G is also interesting. Here, Realme has partnered up with Chilean cinematographer Claudio Miranda. He has worked in films such as Life of Pi, Top Gun: Maverick, The Curious Case of Benjamin Button and Tron: Legacy. He has also won an Academy Award for Best Cinematography for his role in Life of Pi in 2013.

Women in sports management can make a difference 
","Ram Bujhaun Yadav with his land ownership certificate stands near a border pillar which he says was erroneously placed on his land. 
In October 2023, when 51-year-old Ram Bujhaun Yadav of Musaharnia Rural Municipality-5, Mukhiyapatti, Dhanusha, was at a relative’s house, someone told him that two Indian Sashastra Seema Bal (SSB) personnel were looking for him.
Anxious, he rushed home wondering why they were looking for him.
“They asked me if the paddy field in the no man’s land was mine. I told them yes and they asked me to cut down the paddy immediately,” he said.
The paddy was not ripe and Yadav asked them for some time. However, the SSB personnel told him he had to cut down his paddy immediately.
Ram Bujhaun and his wife Tetari Devi each own a 677-square-metre plot of land. As Nepal and India reevaluated the border, Ram Bujhan’s land was been deemed to be near the no man’s land as it now has two demarcation pillars.
Frustrated, Ram Bujhaun cut the paddy before it was due to be harvested. Now, he has been asked to not plant anything on the land as it falls in the no man’s land.
“Our border police don’t say a word. I can’t fight the SSB on my own,” says Ram Bujhaun adding he had decided not to plan anything on the land anymore.
Woes of the farmers
Many farmers in southern Nepal say their land has now been placed in India after the recent demarcation. 
When the Jamuna River, which flows through the no man’s land between Nepal and India, changed its course some two decades ago, some border pillars went missing. Locals say these pillars have now been placed encroaching on Nepali land.
In 2018, with the then Chief District Officer of Dhanusha, Pradeep Raj Kandel, and an official from Madhubani district, Bihar, India, a team that included border security forces from both countries, the Armed Police Force of Nepal, and SSB of India began placing border pillars after land measurement by technicians.
Locals have raised concerns, stating that border pillars have been positioned, encroaching approximately 50 to 100 meters of land into Nepal compared to the previous position. Many like Ram Bujhaun are unaware of when these border pillars were placed.
“I did not know that pillar was placed here. After I found out when I asked the village leaders, many said they were placing the border pillars as they pleased,” said Ram Bujhaun.
He was told to carry on planting paddy and that it would not matter as these issues had happened in the past. 
“They encroached on my land and have asked me not to plant anything. This is gross injustice,” he says.
Ram Bujhaun’s family owns a total of 4,000 square metres of land, with 2,000 square metres belonging to him and the remaining 2,000 square metres to his brother Bechan. However, 1,000 square metres of his land is now located on the Indian side after the demarcation. Despite this, he has been farming on the land and continues to pay taxes to the Department of Land Management and Archive in Nepal.
“They have marked my land to be on the Indian side and placed border pillars on it. I’ve been farming till now but I don’t know when they will ask me to stop,” he says.
Ignorance of the government
The Madhesh province in southern Nepal
The former ward chair of Mukhiyapatti Musharniya Rural Municipality-5, Ram Naresh Yadav, said that over time, India has encroached on numerous Nepali lands in various locations in the Madhesh Province. This, he says, happened due to the Nepali administration’s ignorance and weak stature.
“They (Nepali administration) were careless and that meant the Indian side placed these border pillars by encroaching on Nepali land,” says Ram Naresh.
He said that over 40 farmers from wards 1, 5, and 6 have land ranging from 300 to 1,600 square metres on the Indian side. 
“These farmers have land ownership certificates, but they cannot farm as the SSB says the land is in India and not Nepal,” said Ram Naresh.
In 1996, land ownership certificates were distributed after surveying the land in the border area. Local Dharmendra Kumar Yadav said that since then, the locals have been paying their land tax regularly. In 2018, when the pillar was being placed, the locals protested when they saw their land was being encroached on. However, since the demarcation had been agreed upon by high-ranking government officials of Nepal and India, the farmer’s voices went unheard.
“We tried to stop when the border pillars were being placed on our land. But the administrators from both sides forcibly put it there without even trying to hold a discussion,” said Harish Chandra Yadav. 
The Chief District Officer of Dhanusha, Chakrapani Pandey, says that the border pillars were placed by the technical team after the measurements and with the agreement of the high-ranking officials of the two countries.
“The fields and houses that are built in no man’s land have recently been cleared. No one can do anything in this particular area,” said Pandey. “We understand the people’s concern but we cannot do anything about it now.”"

Priyam Pradhan explores the essence of money and life in ‘Mani’ 
","Photo by pippen on Unsplash
Life is filled with surprises and unexpected events and it can change at any moment. The only thing certain in life is the uncertainty. Change is a natural and inevitable part of our lives, and it may be positive as well as negative.
Even though it is not guaranteed that we will wake up in the morning, we set the alarm every night with the hope that we will wake up in the morning. We do not know what each day is going to bring us, but we may have varieties, adventures, and endless opportunities.
The push to explore
The uncertainty sometimes forces us to explore those aspects of life, we never knew existed or needed. It also tests the mental strength of people and how they deal with it. The uncertainty has taught me to be grateful, as we never know what life throws at us.
In life, everything does not go according to our plans, and if we do not embrace the change we will face huge trouble. The Covid-19 pandemic is the best example of uncertainty, we were constantly fearing death and it was uncertain that we would see the sunrise the next day.
It is not certain that every decision in life will be correct, but if you fear not trying at all, you miss endless opportunities for learning and growing. When our decisions or outcomes are on the negative side, we get depressed and we might tend to think about committing suicide, but we forget that if we have life we have endless opportunities. 
Most of us plan for our careers, our love life, etc. and when those plans do not work out we start getting uncomfortable. But if we can deal with today, we can surely deal with tomorrow. We need to cherish little moments in our lives and know that nothing is permanent not even the failures and setbacks.
We come here with nothing and leave with nothing. So why should we hold the egos and grudges against each other? Instead of making our life meaningful and enjoying the journey of life, we get into puzzles of accumulating wealth and we go against our own loved ones for it. 
Change is certain

Nothing is permanent in life, everything can change in fractions of seconds. In today’s society, everyone is so busy, that we people have so less time for our loved ones. What I have learned over the years, is to find time in our busy schedule for our family because we never know when it will be our last day together with them. 
Yes! Death is a natural process, so if you have to die someday, why should you die with grudges in your heart? But instead of worrying about the inevitable, focusing on the things you can control will bring a lot of happiness in life.
Uncertainty is not only a negative thing; it also brings a lot of opportunity because you dare to change. The life-changing experience will not come knocking down your door, you need to expose yourself. We learn by doing and experimenting, even though we might fail. But that is not the end of the world. I still remember hesitating while applying for the role of leadership, at my school level as it was not certain that I would be chosen.
Even after being selected, I was uncertain about whether I could fulfil my responsibilities or not. But that uncertainty helped me grow out of my comfort zone and give my best input. If I had not applied for that role just because I was uncertain of the outcome, I would miss the biggest learning opportunity in my school life. So, do not let the uncertainty or the unknown ever stop you from trying and no matter how much we try, to plan life always finds a way to surprise us. 
It is important to stay grounded when we have everything we wish for because life can take such a turn that we had never expected in our wildest dreams. Similarly, nothing is permanent in life, the financial hardships, the grades, the breakups, etc. But the most important thing is not to lose hope during those difficult times.
According to the data provided by Nepal police, around 6,830 people took their lives in the fiscal year 2022/23. There is nothing in life that cannot be resolved although it may take time, committing suicide should not be an option. It’s important to share feelings among family members or loved ones because together as a family any problem can be overcome.
Embrace the unknown and focus on enhancing your life, instead of worrying about what will happen next. Always find time for your loved ones, as life is uncertain. We should be grateful that we are alive and accept that change is the only constant thing in life. Do not let the unknown, stop you from trying or achieving your goals and always remember that even if you fail, you still have endless opportunities."

Role of entrepreneurship education in Nepal’s quest for economic empowerment 
","Aayush Kunwar will represent Nepal in his first international race. 
Aayush Kunwar, 28, of Sanfebagar in Achham is excited. The six-foot-tall athlete will represent Nepal in the 100-200m events at the Asian Athletics Championships. The championship is scheduled from July 12 to July 16 in Bangkok. Along with Kunwar, six other Nepali athletes — Shiva Raj Parki, Som Bahadur Kumal, Mukesh Pal, Dipak Adhikari, Fulmati Rana and Raj Pura Pachhai — have also been selected for the championship.   
Onlinekhabar recently caught up with Kunwar. In a conversation, he shared his expectation from the global championship, achievements, and challenges of athletes in Nepal among others. 
Excerpt:
Is this your first international race?
Yes.
Could you share with us how it all happened? 
I was called for a trial by the coaches for the selection of Asian Athletics. After the trial, coaches selected a group of athletes and I was also included in that selection. 
Almost all athletes dream to represent their country in global competitions and it’s no exception for me. I had been trying for such an opportunity for a long time, and now the dream has finally come true. 
How is the training session going? 
The training is going well. Our practice begins at 7 am every day under the supervision of national coaches. We practice according to the category that we are selected for in the Asian Athletics Championships. 
We engage in practice sessions at least three to four days a week, primarily focusing on running drills on the racing track. On the remaining days, we dedicate our training sessions to strength workouts at the gym.
Since it will be your first time in an international event, what are your expectations?
Realistically speaking, Nepal faces challenges in sprint events when compared to countries like China and Japan. However, as an athlete, I was to break the current national record of electronic time which is 10.71 seconds in the 100 metres and 21.95 seconds in the 200 metres. Since 1990 no one has beaten this record. I believe all the Nepali athletes participating in Asian Athletics Championships have a goal to beat the national record. 
Aayush Kunwar says his aim is to break the national records in both the 100m and 200m events. 
How did you get into athletics?
I have been a sports enthusiast since childhood. I was interested in football, table tennis and basketball and the base of every sport is athletics. In 2012, I was studying at Budhanilkantha School and I represented my school in the 200m and 400m races and the long jump in President Running Shield. 
Getting a chance to run in Dasarath Rangasala was huge for me. I won gold medals in the 200m and 400m race and the long jump in the under 18 category. Likewise, I was also announced as the best athlete. Afterwards, members of departmental teams showed interest in me. This made me realise my potential and motivated me to continue athletics.   
Tell us about your participation in a competition that is the most memorable and the achievements you have made to date.
In the 2018 National Games, I represented APF and won a gold medal in the relay race. I consider it as my biggest achievement to date. In the recently held National Games in Pokhara, I came fourth in the 100-metre race but in the 200-metre race unfortunately I couldn’t compete due to the hamstring. And now for the first time, I am representing Nepal on the global platform, which is also one of my biggest achievements.  
Professionally you are a financial analyst, so how have you been managing time for athletics?    
Actually, it is not that difficult. Most of the athletics events take place in the morning and after completing them I go to the office. My passion for sports or athletics also helps me to keep doing so. If you have a  passion you can take both sports and work simultaneously.   
As an athlete what sorts of challenges have you faced so far?
The main challenge for Nepali athletes is the lack of exposure and sponsors. It is hard for athletes to get sponsors. Similarly, there is also a lack of competition within the country. If the athletes get sufficient exposure and chance to participate in the tournaments they can do much better. And lastly, the infrastructure for the athletes should also be upgraded."

Kathmandu, July 5
Nepal lost a nail-biter against Ireland to finish eighth in the ongoing ICC World Cup Qualifier in Zimbabwe on Tuesday.
Nepal pushed Ireland, a full-member cricketing nation, to their limit as they barely chased 269 with two wickets and four balls remaining.
Winning the toss, the Irish put Nepal to bat first. Nepali batters started the game cautiously but lost opener Kushal Bhurtel in the power play. The batters that followed struggled to get going despite getting starts which reduced Nepal to 103 for four.
It was looking like Nepal would not post a par score but handy innings from Kushal Malla, Sandeep Lamichhane and Gulshan Jha took Nepal to a respectable score. Malla scored 44 while Lamichhane and Jha score 32 and 57 respectively as Nepal finished 268 in 50 overs.
In reply, the Irish got off to a horrible start losing Andy McBrine and Andy Balbirnie in the first five overs. Like Nepali batters, the Irish also struggled but matured innings from Hary Tector, Lorcan Tucker and Curtis Campher helped take the scoreboard forward. There was a time when it looked like the Irish would win comfortably but timely wickets by Nepali bowler gave the team hope of an upset. But the Irish proved too good as they narrowly beat Nepal with two wickets and four balls to spare.
Karan KC was superb with the ball taking four wickets, as was Kishore Mahato who picked up two wickets.
With the loss, Nepal finished eighth out of ten teams in the qualifiers.
The team will now play in the ACC Emerging Teams Asia Cup in Sri Lanka which is starting on July 14 where they will take on India A, Pakistan A and the UAE."

Bengaluru, June 28
The game was on a knife-edge at the Sree Kanteerava Stadium in Bengaluru. Nepal were the better team but had nothing to show for it. Many had dubbed the game an exhibition and a dead rubber. But both Nepal and Pakistan wanted to end the SAFF Championship on a high.
There was tension in the stadium. Both were pushing to score but the lack of quality on both sides was evident. It was clear if the game was to have a winner, it would come through a moment of brilliance or a mistake.
Kiran Chemjong’s long clearance caused some chaos outside the Pakistan penalty area. The players were trying to clear the ball but it fell fortuitously on Ashish Chaudhary’s foot. Without thinking twice, Chaudhary hit the ball. It was not a convincing strike but the ball ended up in the back of the Pakistan net thanks to some uneven bounce as the boy who was working as a labourer in the southern plains of Nepal scored his first goal for the country and gave Nepal the lead.
Prior to that, Nepal had many chances. Bimal Gharti Magar missed a sitter as Nepal hit the crossbar and the post a couple of times. It was like the universe did not want Nepal to score. But Chaudhary had a different idea as he gave Nepal their only win in the 2023 SAFF Championship.
The moments following the goal were chaotic. Nepal had multiple chances to finish the game but lack of experience and quality meant the team could not take advantage of Pakistan going all in leaving gaps in defence.

This was Nepal’s first win against Pakistan in the SAFF Championship in 15 years. But the win did not come easy. Pakistan’s lack of chemistry was evident as they should have been put away by Nepal long before Chaudhary scored in the 80th minute. 
This was Pakistan’s 12th loss in a row. Like Nepal, Pakistan had lost both its game in the SAFF Championship and were looking for a consolation win. But that was not to happen as the team once again performed below par and lost to an inexperienced Nepal
Nepal, however, have only positives to take from the tournament. Head coach Vincenzo Alberto Annese said he was happy with the team’s performance. And he had every right to be, without time to prepare for the SAFF Championship, the team played quite well. 
If you take away the first half against Kuwait, the team did all they could and come back rejuvenated as they hope to carry on the momentum in future competitions."

","Shakti Gauchan training young cricketers at Star Cricket Academy. 
Shakti Gauchan, known for his gentle demeanour and infectious smile, dedicated 19 years to serving Nepal’s national cricket team. Gauchan retired from international cricket five years ago but his life still revolves around it.
His career has been a successful one. Along with Paras Khadka, Gauchan became a household name as he help take Nepal from the depths of Division 5 to gaining ODI status.
He had many highs during his career. Playing in the 2014 T20 World Cup was his greatest moment but what stands out for him is how the team received ODI status for the first time in 2018. But one dream eluded him as Nepal never got close to becoming a test nation.
“It is what it is,” says Gauchan.
The test dream
Shakti Gauchan played for Nepal’s national team for 19 years.
But Shakti Gauchan has not given up on his dream. Gauchan, despite not playing a test, wants to pave the way for the coming generation as he hopes to see the country become a test nation in his lifetime.
Every time he was not with the national team, he would be at the New Horizon School in Butwal training students. He worked there for 20 years.
When being a cricketer was not as glorious as it is now, Gauchan was thankful to the school for employing him as a coach. The money he got from coaching kept his passion going and stopped him from giving up on cricket and leaving the country.
“I would have surely left,” says Gauchan as cricketing events were sporadic at the time.
Academy to produce cricket stars
Shakti Gauchan with the students of Star Cricket Academy. 
Shakti Gauchan wanted to establish a cricket academy when he was playing. He knew it was important as that would help the country produce good players. Recognising the importance of starting early, Gauchan, in 2019, founded the Star Cricket Academy on his personal property in Omsatiya rural municipality, Rupandehi. There, he trains kids as young as 10 as he hopes to produce cricketers for the national team for years to come.
The academy features a dedicated training facility with nets, while the ground floor includes a hostel to accommodate players.
The Star Cricket Academy provides training to a group of 50 schoolchildren aged 10 and above. Among them, 25 students receive free training at an academy. With his vast experience, Gauchan possesses the ability to identify potential talents among these aspiring young players.
Asman Tharu, a 17-year-old from an economically disadvantaged background, is benefiting from free training at Star Cricket Academy.
“Sir (Gauchan) does not take fees from me and even provides bat,” says Tharu. 
Having already participated in district-level competitions for his age category, Tharu is now dreaming to represent the national team in the future.
Like Tharu, Rahul Bhandari has also been receiving training at Star Cricket Academy for the last four years. 
Bhandari says he has been inspired by players like Kushal Malla and Susan Bhari, who are products of Gauchan, as he wants to follow their steps and get into the national team.
The construction of an indoor hall has provided a convenient training space for players, ensuring uninterrupted practice even during rainy seasons and winter. Malla’s remarkable progress is attributed to the availability of this facility, and Gauchan takes immense pride and happiness in witnessing his development.
Spinner Sushan Bhari has emerged as a prominent player in domestic cricket, showcasing his talent and skills. Shakti Gauchan’s students have consistently displayed impressive performances, asserting their dominance in the age group team of Lumbini province. With their continuous progress, they are gradually carving out a significant place in the national team as well.
Binod Kunwar and his wife Sudikshya Gautam, successful entrepreneurs running a technology company in Sydney, Australia, and Nepal, have shown their unwavering support to Gauchan.
The two have taken a remarkable step by laying the foundation stone of Astrotech Oval, a cricket stadium in Tilottama. As part of their ambitious plan, they have entrusted Gauchan with the crucial responsibility of overseeing an academy that will accommodate 100 players with residential facilities.
“This academy can significantly help me to attain my dream,” says Gauchan.  
Gauchan expresses that the day when Nepal achieves test status in cricket will hold a significance even greater than his participation in the World Cup.

Realme 12 Pro+ 5G: Is it the best designed phone for 2024?

Bangalore, June 27
The SAFF Championship has been a dream for Nepal’s football team and the millions of football fans in the country. Since 1993, Nepal has taken part in all SAFF Championships but has not won it a single time with their best finish coming in 2021 when it reached the final and lost to India.
This year, the team once again failed as they bowed out of the group stage after losing to Kuwait and India. But the team has a chance to end the tournament on a positive note as they take on Pakistan later today.
If the performance against Kuwait in the second half and India are to go by, Nepal has a great chance to finish the tournament with a consolation win in what many people are calling an exhibition match.
Nepal started the SAFF Championship timidly and were punished by Kuwait who proved too good for Nepal. Nepal’s loss in the game can be attributed to a lacklustre start in the first half. With the team only waking up in the last 15 minutes, the game was long lost by then.

Against India, things were different. The team played a solid game and even had chances to score. But as they did not take these chances, they were punished by Sunil Chhetri once again as they lost 2-0 and with it bowed out of the SAFF Championship.
Everyone knew the team was not ready to take on heavyweights like Kuwait, India and Lebanon in the SAFF Championship. The preparation was poor and the team lacked experience. But, just like in life, football held the promise of hope, only to have it mercilessly crushed early on.
“We have done well despite everything that has gone on in Nepali football over the last year,” said head coach Vincenzo Alberto Annese. “We had one practice match before the tournament. If you give me one month with this team, things would have been different.”
Pakistan have not had the best tournament either. Making a comeback in SAFF Championship after their FIFA suspension, the team only arrived in India a few hours before their match against India. It was no surprise they were comfortably beaten by India and Kuwait. 
Prior to the tournament, Pakistan played in the four-nations cup in Mauritius where they were beaten by the hosts, Kenya and Djibouti. The team has players playing in European leagues, but the performance is not been up to the level and Pakistan want to change that against Nepal.

In 2022, after their suspension was lifted, Pakistan took on Nepal in a friendly match and lost. So Pakistan will want to avenge that result. Nepal has also not beaten Pakistan in the SAFF Championship in over 15 years which a not a good omen for Nepal heading into the match today. 
The two have played each other seven times and have won two games each with three ending in draws. Overall, the two teams have played each other 17 times with Nepal winning six, Pakistan winning five and six ending in draws.
Looking back at history and given how the two have performed, it is likely that this too will end in a stalemate.
Both teams are likely to make changes. Anjan Bista is injured and will miss out said Annese as he has hinted he will make more changes and ask his team to play an attacking style and be more fearless.
“We want to win and for that to happen, we need to be brave,” he said."

Nepal have crashed out of the ICC Cricket World Cup Qualifier after being beaten by the Netherlands by seven wickets at the Takashinga Sports Club in Harare on Saturday.
In what was a do-or-die match in the qualifier, Nepal were put out to bat by the Netherlands who immediately reaped the rewards as they sent Aasif Sheikh back in for a duck.
Kushal Bhurtel and Bhim Sharki did well to negate the opening hour but got out after getting in as Nepal were reduced to 66 for four. 
Nepali batters were once again poor against short balls as the Netherlands took advantage of their weakness. Kushal Malla got out trying to take the game to the Netherlands while Rohit Paudel was caught trying to pull.
With the top and middle order not scoring, the lower order tried but the Netherlands reduced Nepal to only 167.
Logan van Beek was superb with the ball as he took four wickets for only 24 runs while Bas de Leede and Vikramjeet Singh took two wickets each. Aryan Dutta and Clayton Floyd took one wicket each.

In reply, the Netherlands made short work of the total as they came out all guns blazing. Nepal were hoping to get some purchase of the pitch for the spinners but some blistering hitting from Max O’Dowd, who scored 90, took the game away from Nepal very quickly as the Netherlands beat Nepal by seven wickets with 137 balls to spare.
With this, the Netherlands have booked a place in the super six of the ICC Cricket World Cup Qualifier along with the West Indies and Zimbabwe from Group A.

Nepal lost to the West Indies by 101 runs in their third match of the ICC Cricket World Cup Qualifier at the Harare Sports Club in Harare on June 22.
In what was their second match against a test nation, Nepal won the toss and decided to bowl first. Like in the second match against the USA, Karan KC once again struck early as he sent Kyle Mayers in his first over. With the ball moving around a bit, the West Indies batters were very cautious as Johnson Charles was caught behind off the bowling of Gulshan Jha.
Captain Shai Hope and opener Brandon King tried to settle the innings but King’s weakness against spin was once again his downfall as he was bowled by legspinner Sandeep Lamichhane who took his first wicket of the ICC Cricket World Cup Qualifiers.
The innings then took a turn as Hope and Nicholas Pooran started to play attacking strokes to put pressure on the Nepali bowlers. 
Pooran was dropped twice by Aasif Sheikh and made Nepal pay as she smashed the ball to all parts of the ground to score his second-century finish with 115 of 94 balls. Hope also played a magnificent inning as he anchored his team’s innings with 132 of 129 balls.
The two playing such attacking cricket then gave players like Rovman Powell and Jason Holder to take the score to 339 of 50 overs.

","Sabitra Bhandari is regarded as one of the top strikers in South Asia, and she will be the first-ever Nepali footballer to play in Europe. Photo: Aryan Dhimal
After a decade of hustle, Sabitra Bhandari, also known as Samba, has finally accomplished her long-cherished aspiration of playing for a European team. On June 13,  the 26-year-old signed to play for an Israeli club Hapoel Raanana Women’s FC in the Israeli Women’s League ‘Ligat Nashim’. 
Bhandari is regarded as one of the top strikers in South Asia, and she will be the first-ever Nepali footballer to play in Europe. 
Her aspirations go beyond merely playing as Bhandari wants to make a lasting impact in the league. She views the Israeli league as a stepping stone towards her ultimate goal of representing top-tier European clubs.
“I am excited to play in the league. I cannot express in words, how happy I am. But this is just the start,” she says.
Humble beginning
Sabitra Bhandari’s footballing career started when she was signed up by the Armed Police Force (APF) in 2014 aged 18. 
Sabitra Bhandari developed a passion for football from a young age. Despite the modest circumstances, she would engage in the sport without owning proper footwear or a football. As the second child in a family of six siblings, she embraced her love for the game with limited resources.
“I remember playing barefoot with balls made out of socks,” he says.
As a woman whose main aim was to play football, Sabitra Bhandari faced numerous challenges along her journey. However, her unwavering dedication and relentless hard work propelled her forward. That was not all, Bhandari strongly believes that her parents played a pivotal role in shaping her current position.
“They always inspired me to play football,” she says.
She also thanks Sukra Tamang, a former ANFA referee, for introducing her to professional football.
The dream begins

Sabitra Bhandari’s footballing career started when she was signed up by the Armed Police Force (APF) in 2014 aged 18. Her performance at the club level soon got her a national team call up and since then Bhandari has not looked back.
She has been amazing scoring 43 goals in 41 games. Her performance in these games has been nothing short of extraordinary. But has faced some setbacks most notably tearing her anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) in 2021 while playing in the Women’s National League.
“I could not play for a year. That made me very anxious as I spend days thinking if I could come back to football. But everything went well and here I am going to Israel,” she says.
During the recently concluded Indian Women’s League in May, Sabitra Bhandari showcased outstanding performance and emerged as the top scorer in the league. She feels playing in India has been integral to her getting signed up by an Israeli team as her dream to play in Europe is finally being fulfilled.
The opportunity and future prospect

Sabitra Bhandrai’s performance in India had everyone in Nepal raving. Watching her showcase her talent there was the head coach of the men’s football team Vincenzo Alberto Annese. 
Annese played a pivotal role in connecting Bhandari with an agent who has now provided her with an exciting opportunity to exhibit her talent in Israel.
“One day he called me and informed me that he has a friend who is an agent. He told me she could help me fulfil my dream of playing in a European league. I did not think twice and spoke to her,” says Bhandari.
Following their talk, the agent found Bhandari a club. But she views this accomplishment as the beginning of her journey as she is dreaming big.
“I want to play for the top clubs in the world. I will continue to work hard to fulfil that dream,” she says. 
Sabitra Bhandari is not wasting time and has already started to train to play in the Israeli league. Committed as ever, she is following the practice schedule of Hapoel Raanana Women’s FC, immersing herself in the training regimen of the team so she can adapt quickly and make a mark in the league.
Hapoel Raanana was not the only team that approached her. She was approached by the league champions too, but she felt the project offered by Hapoel Raanana was best for her career.
The joy of Bhandari’s achievement extends beyond her personal fulfilment. Her teammates are equally happy for her are are celebrating her success.
“The younger players have been thanking me for opening an avenue to a European league,” says Bhandari. “The senior players are also equally positive, they have been motivating me for further growth.”  
Another exciting development for Nepali football enthusiasts is that Nepal will be participating in the Asian Games for the very first time. This milestone presents a remarkable opportunity Sabitra Bhandri and the women’s team to test themselves against the best in Asia.
“I am excited for the Asian Games. We all area. It will give us good exposure. If we perform well, there will be more opporutinies for us,” she says.
Despite the Nepali women’s football team progressing remarkably, the concerned bodies have remained indifferent to its development. Nepal’s football governing body, the All Nepal Football Association (ANFA) does not organise regular tournaments which means new players hardly get chances to join the national team. 
Apart from three departmental teams, Nepal does not have permanent women’s football clubs. This absence of dedicated clubs poses challenges in organising domestic leagues for women’s football in the country. 
Sabitra Bhandari believes, addressing this gap and establishing more women’s football clubs could contribute to the growth of women’s football in Nepal.
“We have many good players who are waiting for a chance. If A Division clubs support us, we can take the women’s football team to new heights,” she says."

With this, Nepal are still winless against Kuwait in 10 matches.
Kuwait dominated the first half and scored two goals thanks to Khaled Hajiah and Shabaib Al-Khaldi. Nepal struggled to keep the ball as Kuwait easily play around the defences of Nepal as they dominated the game from the first whistle as the scoreline flattered Nepal. Defensive lapses did not help the team either.
Kuwatis started the second half in the same fashion as they piled the pressure on Nepal with Mohmmad Abdullah scoring a penalty midway through the half putting Kuwait 3-0 up.
Nepal then stepped up their game and put some pressure on Kuwait. The pressure counted as Anjan Bista scored his 12th goal for Nepal and became the third Nepali to score against Kuwait. The team tried but a lack of confidence upfront meant Nepal did not create enough chances to get back into the game.

Bengaluru, June 21
Today, Nepal is set to face Kuwait in their opening match of the SAFF Championship at the Sree Kanteerava Stadium in Bengaluru.
The Nepali team has arrived in Bengaluru with very little preparation with their new coach and a very inexperienced team.
Despite that, head coach Vincenzo Alberto Annese up hopeful to bring a good result against tournament favourites Kuwait.
Speaking to Onlinekhabar on Tuesday, Annese said despite not having enough time to prepare for the tournament, the team was in good spirits ahead of their first game against Kuwait.
“We are fit and ready. Kuwait are a good team and we know it is going to be tough but we are ready for the challenge,” he said.
He feels the preparations would have been better if they had more time before the tournament. But with the league ending only 10 days ahead of the tournament, Annese could not prepare the team as he would have liked.
“The game against the Philippines was good practice for us. We took on them with only two days of training and did quite well. We had chances in the game. If we had 10 days before that game, we could have won I feel,” he says.
It has been a little over three months since Annese took over as the head coach. As the league season was ongoing at that time, he has not been able to spend much time with the national team. Despite that, he feels hopeful.
Annese did not say what his goals were for the SAFF Championship. But he did say he wants to start the tournament positively and hopes the team can play with his philosophy.
“My and the team’s main focus right now is Kuwait. We go one game at a time,” he said.
Familiar foes

Nepal and Kuwait have been meeting regularly. Since 2019, the two have played five times with Kuwait winning four and drawing one.
In the nine total games the two have played against each other, Kuwait have won eight of them with their latest win coming in June 2022 during the AFC Asian Cup Qualifier where they beat Nepal 4-1.
This, however, is Kuwait’s first participation in the SAFF Championship and Nepal wants to welcome the Kuwaitis with a defeat in their first match."

Nepal beat the USA by six wickets in their second game of the ICC Cricket World Cup Qualifier at Takashinga Sports Club in Harare on June 20.
Winning the toss, Nepal put the USA to bat and immediately reaped the rewards as Karan KC sent back Steven Taylor and Saiteja Mukkamalla in the second over of the game. The US batters struggled against KC’s precise line and length leaving them visibly uncomfortable throughout the opening hour of the match.
KC’s discipline proved too good as, the US’s stand-in captain, Aaron Jones and Nosthush Kenjige soon fell victim reducing the US to 18 for the loss of four wickets.

Shayan Jahangir played some positive strokes to settle the innings for the US. He took on all Nepali bowlers including Sandeep Lamichhane and Gulshan Jha and Aarif Sheikh as he scored an impressive 79-ball century. But with wickets falling at the other end regularly, Jahangir was left frustrated as the US were bowled out for 207 in 49 overs.
Karan KC was the pick of the bowlers as he took four wickets for 33 runs. Airee and Lalit Rajbanshi were also impressive as they held off an end. Airee took two wickets in five overs giving away only 15 runs while Rajbanshi took one wicket in 10 overs giving away only 20 runs. Jha finished the US’s tail as he took three wickets.
In reply, Nepali openers started where they left off in the first game against Zimbabwe as they attacked the US bowlers. But their attacking gameplay did not pay dividends and Saurabh Netravalkar trapped Aasif Sheikh and Nosthush Kenjige caught Kushal Bhurtel for 12 and 39 respectively.
But a mature innings from Bhim Sarki (77) and a late burst from Airee (39) took Nepal home giving the rhinos the first win of the ICC World Cup Qualifier.

In 2023, Barbie named Women in Sports as their career of the year.
Whenever I am out and about socially, there is always someone who seems pretty certain about not considering my profession as mainstream. Hold up! Sports as a career? In Nepal? You bet! This article aims to explain why women in this male-dominant sports industry in Nepal should not be viewed as a surprise.
I have been part of the Nepali cricket industry in a private capacity for quite a while now. Armed with a Master’s Degree in IT from an American University, my choice to stick with sports management tends to raise eyebrows. While I am not an on-field player, I am definitely behind the scenes, playing strong games of serious deliverance with my team. We are all about creating what is not there.
As untouched and less discussed as the sports management industry is in Nepal, it has ample room to showcase creativity. Being a commanding woman in a position can be challenging, but on the brighter side, the gender advantage has yet to fail me. As alien as I might be in sports management in Nepal, I have been accepted with open arms. The nature of the job is highly competitive, no doubt.

Women in sports are safe, heard, and welcomed. I absolutely relish the addition of spirited women to the team. The nuances of sports are something women complement greatly. Sports management inherently rejects narrow minds. There is a lot of travelling, meeting people, experimenting, and remembering limitations. The adjustments are both trivial and clever. 
Often, in our part of the world, societal norms limit women from making career decisions, hindering them from living life on their terms. This restriction potentially keeps many capable women from pursuing the sports industry, where they could truly wield their power to make an impact. Change is gradual, and I hope to see numerous female faces in charge of stadiums someday in Nepal.
Yes, there are challenges. It ranges from personal sacrifices to job security and opportunities. However, these are workable factors for any freelancer in sports management. The key is excelling at our jobs to thrive anywhere. 
Taking a page from the medical field, the seriousness we apply there should not differ in sports management. Sports is a powerful industry. Children grow up idolising what we showcase on TV. As glorious as the game is, it is every child’s dream to represent their country someday. Carrying that responsibility is our role in sports—an often thankless yet deeply satisfying job.
Nepali sports industry
The fans went wild at TU Cricket Ground after Nepal beat UAE.
Sports may be a smaller industry in Nepal, but globally, it is a behemoth. The world economy has shifted, and it is time we alter our perspective to recognise the potential of sports as an industry in Nepal. The idea of open commercialisation of sports remains somewhat unexplored, as it continues to be a more exclusive affair in Nepal. 
By sourcing innovative ideas, there’s a wealth of public attention and investment waiting to be tapped into, along with numerous practices to establish and discard. As the Nepali team achieves international records, the packaging of the sport becomes everything. There is plenty to learn from international sports management to make our industry highly marketable and poised for global entry.
Sports such as cricket, football, volleyball, or even golf serve as key intersections for reshaping Nepal’s global narrative. Over the years, Kabaddi has witnessed a substantial surge in India, both in terms of viewership and commercial success. The primary challenge we grapple with is Nepal’s comparatively small market size, posing constraints on our ability to generate substantial economic gains. Therefore, there is unanimous agreement on the imperative for Nepal’s sports to venture onto the international stage.
Nepal boasts many hardworking individuals, yet achieving this goal demands specialised talents in sports management with the requisite experience and the capacity to enhance existing values. In the long run, outsourcing such talents may foster dependence. Hence, a concerted effort is needed to inspire Nepali youth to engage in sports management, contributing to our sports ecosystem. 
There are various ways in which we can harness the potential of sports for our benefit. Encouraging youth involvement can be instrumental in capitalising on the multifaceted opportunities presented by the sports industry. There is a lot to explore if you think about it."

Nepal to take on UAE in the seventh-place playoff of the ICC Cricket World Cup Qualifier
","Painting ‘My Private Life’ by artist Priyam Pradhan at the exhibition Mani at Siddhartha Art Gallery, Baber Mahal. Photo: Chandra Bahadur Ale
Using Pitt’s artist pen on paper, artist Priyam Pradhan presents My Private Life, a showcase of the current significance of his life depicted in abstract form.
At the centre of the painting is a 1000-rupee note, within which Pradhan has intricately painted Lord Krishna, a man wearing a hoodie tenderly embracing his dog, and a woman. The woman stands tall, elongated in form. Towards the bottom of the canvas, a holy man reaches out his hands, appearing to be in flight.
Priyam Pradhan has used a vibrant colour palette, incorporating bright hues such as pink, orange, and yellow, as well as green, black, white, and grey. This combination adds a dynamic and lively quality to the artwork.
“The man in the centre is me and the girl in green is my girlfriend. And the faces are my mom and dad,” says Pradhan. “The sadhu (holy man) symbolises my desires that I don’t have many desires for materialistic things however I do understand the value of money.”
The use of colours, figures and lines in an abstract form in his painting resembles the painting of American painter Paul Jackson Pollock. Like his abstract expressionism, Pradhan has expressed himself in his painting.
Furthermore, this marks Priyam Pradhan’s third solo painting exhibition titled Mani (money), inaugurated on January 17 at Siddhartha Art Gallery, Baber Mahal.
In his previous exhibitions, Pradhan’s artworks centred around Hindu philosophy and his spontaneous thought process. However, in this latest exhibition, he explores the theme of money and its impact on an individual’s life, delving into the reverberating effects of financial aspects.
Understanding the value of money

Any form of art is known as a reflection of the contemporary time. Likewise, Priyam Pradhan’s paintings reflect the lifestyle, desires, obligations and more of today’s younger generation living in urban areas in Nepal.
Pradhan himself is in his 20s and he has justified the want of most of the youngsters in their 20s, who might be declared adults and understand the need for money and materialistic things but are still kids at their heart who want to explore and experience life as much as possible.
The exhibition has 27 paintings which Pradhan took around nine months to complete. According to him, while he was travelling the idea that his life was luxurious and him being capable of exploring anything he wanted to was because of money.
And being an artist this concept lingered on him and he was compelled to create on the theme of money.
Once you enter the gallery, you can also view an animated video, which introduces artist Pradhan and the importance of money, which is on the ground floor. On the first floor, a huge painting (193×62 in cm) Apatkalin Awastha using mixed media on canvas welcomes you and other paintings are small in size (18×30 in cm).
“It is a team work and it is my introduction as an artist for the exhibition,” he says. “Also, being a recent multimedia graduate from Islington College, I wanted to explore my skills and I got my team. Then, like money, multimedia is relevant to current society.”
Experiencing life through art
Painting by artist Priyam Pradhan at Siddhartha Art Gallery, Baber Mahal. Photo: Chandra Bahadur Ale 
Priyam Pradhan says enjoyment is the meaning of life and he enjoys creating artwork. Moreover, Pradhan who came into the art world first being a tattoo artist feels blessed that he has the privilege to explore whatever he likes in his life.
He also believes that the philosophy that says one should not be materialistic is wrong. “If material things are not important, why would one build a house? And after building a house why do they want to decorate their house?” he questions.
Alongside, money and materialistic things, his paintings also explore love, romance, life and childhood experiences. Motifs like Pokemon, ramen noodles, animals, dancers, etc have been used in his paintings. In most of his paintings, he has used numerous white lines in wavy form and these lines for Pradhan indicate the sound or the energy that exists in the surroundings all the time.
About using a pitta artist pen, he says, “I have enjoyed drawing and painting since my childhood and using a pitta artist pen helps me revisit that feeling of happiness and sense of freedom.”
So many things happening on the canvas with the use of vibrant colours gives a sense of excitement to the viewers. Though referencing artists like Pollock, MF Husain, Picasso and more, his pen strokes give a sense of newness through his expression and thoughts about his life experiences.
In his paintings, these bright colours and motifs are in harmony and are visual treats that can surely cheer up the mood of any visitor. Moreover, you can also get free stickers from the artist.
If you too are in a gloomy mood and want to uplift a little, visit the exhibition that continues till February 6."

","Entrepreneurship education is not just an investment in the education system; it is an investment in the nation’s future prosperity. Photo: Pexels/ Rodnae Productions
In the shadow of the towering Himalayas, Nepal faces a challenge that rivals the steepness of its mountainous terrain- the challenge of economic development. As the nation earnestly pursues its Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), it becomes increasingly evident that a transformation in the education system is not only necessary but also urgent. 
Rooted in common living strategies, the prevailing education model, especially in higher education, may not adequately prepare the youth for the demands of the modern world. 
In this critical juncture, the incorporation of entrepreneurship education emerges as a beacon of hope, offering a pathway towards a self-reliant and prosperous Nepal.
Time to reevaluate the education system
Nepal’s journey towards economic prosperity has been marked by challenges that demand innovative solutions. The commitment of the SDGs reflects not only a global responsibility but also a domestic imperative for sustainable development. For this, it is high time to reevaluate the education system in the country.
The current education system in Nepal, deeply entrenched in common living strategies, has been the foundation of learning for generations. However, in the face of a rapidly evolving world, today’s generation aspires for more than the status quo. The call for independence reverberates through the aspirations of youth who seek a curriculum fostering critical thinking, innovation and entrepreneurial skills.
Entrepreneurship education is a dynamic force capable of reshaping Nepal’s educational landscape. This innovative approach moves beyond traditional learning methods, providing students with the tools to navigate the complexities of the modern world. At its core, entrepreneurship education is about empowering students to implement learned information in practical and tangible ways.
Consider a student engrossed in the intricacies of sensor systems during a science class, entrepreneurship education transforms this theoretical knowledge into practical applications, inspiring the creation of a sensor-operated door. Such innovation born from a fusion of science and entrepreneurship becomes a valuable mindset in solving practical problems.  
Expanding the horizons of entrepreneurship education, let us delve into chemistry. Imagine students studying chemistry not just as a theoretical subject, but also as entrepreneurs in the making. Armed with entrepreneurial principles, these students can tap into Nepal’s rich biodiversity, exploring market demands for products derived from local plants.
In the scenario, chemistry students could embark on a journey to develop performance-enhancing products based on market demand, harnessing the potential of indigenous flora. What makes this approach remarkable is that it does not necessarily require sophisticated machines or extensive human resources. Instead, it leverages the inherent skills and awareness of individuals within the community, paving the way for a grassroots economic revolution.
Entrepreneurship in education 
Representational graphic. Image: Freepik
The beauty of entrepreneurship education lies in its universal applicability. It is not confined to science or chemistry alone. Consider an art student, for example. Through entrepreneurship education, they can understand what art to develop (product), how much to set the price (price), where to sell (place) and how to sell (promote) their artworks. Every subject becomes a canvas for innovation and enterprise.
Moreover, entrepreneurship education is a powerful equaliser, recognising the unique skills and talents of individuals across various disciplines. It is not about fitting into a predefined mould but rather about unleashing the potential within each student. When every single person is aware of their skills and potential, they can rise to different levels, contributing to the overall progress of the nation.
Entrepreneurship education goes beyond skill recognition; it is about nurturing the ability to produce goods and mastering the art of marketing. Returning to the example of the student developing a sensor-operated door, entrepreneurship education not only equips them to produce the product but also teaches them how to navigate the complexities of marketing it to potential users and clients.
The impact of entrepreneurship education extends beyond individual success stories; it reverberates through the entire nation. A generation equipped with entrepreneurial skills becomes a driving force for economic growth and independence. They will be able to recognise the resources and ideas to utilise them to reach the global market. They will be able to be the pioneers in products and contribute to the economy. By fostering a culture of innovation, creativity and self-reliance, Nepal can reduce its dependence on external sources and strengthen its economy from within.
In essence, entrepreneurship education is not just an investment in the education system; it is an investment in the nation’s future prosperity. It is a transformative force that has the potential to shape a generation of independent thinkers, innovators and entrepreneurs- the architects of a self-reliant and economically vibrant Nepal. Entrepreneurship education, by teaching students to utilise available resources (physical and financial) and make them commercial, becomes a cornerstone in the nation’s journey towards economic empowerment and independence."

CAVA Men’s Volleyball: Nepal finish the tournament winless
","Ram Bujhaun Yadav with his land ownership certificate stands near a border pillar which he says was erroneously placed on his land. 
In October 2023, when 51-year-old Ram Bujhaun Yadav of Musaharnia Rural Municipality-5, Mukhiyapatti, Dhanusha, was at a relative’s house, someone told him that two Indian Sashastra Seema Bal (SSB) personnel were looking for him.
Anxious, he rushed home wondering why they were looking for him.
“They asked me if the paddy field in the no man’s land was mine. I told them yes and they asked me to cut down the paddy immediately,” he said.
The paddy was not ripe and Yadav asked them for some time. However, the SSB personnel told him he had to cut down his paddy immediately.
Ram Bujhaun and his wife Tetari Devi each own a 677-square-metre plot of land. As Nepal and India reevaluated the border, Ram Bujhan’s land was been deemed to be near the no man’s land as it now has two demarcation pillars.
Frustrated, Ram Bujhaun cut the paddy before it was due to be harvested. Now, he has been asked to not plant anything on the land as it falls in the no man’s land.
“Our border police don’t say a word. I can’t fight the SSB on my own,” says Ram Bujhaun adding he had decided not to plan anything on the land anymore.
Woes of the farmers
Many farmers in southern Nepal say their land has now been placed in India after the recent demarcation. 
When the Jamuna River, which flows through the no man’s land between Nepal and India, changed its course some two decades ago, some border pillars went missing. Locals say these pillars have now been placed encroaching on Nepali land.
In 2018, with the then Chief District Officer of Dhanusha, Pradeep Raj Kandel, and an official from Madhubani district, Bihar, India, a team that included border security forces from both countries, the Armed Police Force of Nepal, and SSB of India began placing border pillars after land measurement by technicians.
Locals have raised concerns, stating that border pillars have been positioned, encroaching approximately 50 to 100 meters of land into Nepal compared to the previous position. Many like Ram Bujhaun are unaware of when these border pillars were placed.
“I did not know that pillar was placed here. After I found out when I asked the village leaders, many said they were placing the border pillars as they pleased,” said Ram Bujhaun.
He was told to carry on planting paddy and that it would not matter as these issues had happened in the past. 
“They encroached on my land and have asked me not to plant anything. This is gross injustice,” he says.
Ram Bujhaun’s family owns a total of 4,000 square metres of land, with 2,000 square metres belonging to him and the remaining 2,000 square metres to his brother Bechan. However, 1,000 square metres of his land is now located on the Indian side after the demarcation. Despite this, he has been farming on the land and continues to pay taxes to the Department of Land Management and Archive in Nepal.
“They have marked my land to be on the Indian side and placed border pillars on it. I’ve been farming till now but I don’t know when they will ask me to stop,” he says.
Ignorance of the government
The Madhesh province in southern Nepal
The former ward chair of Mukhiyapatti Musharniya Rural Municipality-5, Ram Naresh Yadav, said that over time, India has encroached on numerous Nepali lands in various locations in the Madhesh Province. This, he says, happened due to the Nepali administration’s ignorance and weak stature.
“They (Nepali administration) were careless and that meant the Indian side placed these border pillars by encroaching on Nepali land,” says Ram Naresh.
He said that over 40 farmers from wards 1, 5, and 6 have land ranging from 300 to 1,600 square metres on the Indian side. 
“These farmers have land ownership certificates, but they cannot farm as the SSB says the land is in India and not Nepal,” said Ram Naresh.
In 1996, land ownership certificates were distributed after surveying the land in the border area. Local Dharmendra Kumar Yadav said that since then, the locals have been paying their land tax regularly. In 2018, when the pillar was being placed, the locals protested when they saw their land was being encroached on. However, since the demarcation had been agreed upon by high-ranking government officials of Nepal and India, the farmer’s voices went unheard.
“We tried to stop when the border pillars were being placed on our land. But the administrators from both sides forcibly put it there without even trying to hold a discussion,” said Harish Chandra Yadav. 
The Chief District Officer of Dhanusha, Chakrapani Pandey, says that the border pillars were placed by the technical team after the measurements and with the agreement of the high-ranking officials of the two countries.
“The fields and houses that are built in no man’s land have recently been cleared. No one can do anything in this particular area,” said Pandey. “We understand the people’s concern but we cannot do anything about it now.”"

","Regenerative braking representational image. Photo: Freepik
The electric vehicle market in Nepal has grown significantly over the past year. 
Electric four-wheelers and two-wheelers are being launched almost every month, spanning from passenger to commercial vehicles. Electric transportation appears to be an emerging trend in the automotive industry.
New EVs are regularly introduced with advanced features as car companies develop unique electric platforms. One standout feature is regenerative braking.
Regenerative braking was first introduced in 1967 by the American Motor Car Company (AMC) in their prototype electric vehicle, the AMC Amitron. However, Toyota became the automobile manufacturer to implement regenerative braking system (RBS) technology in their Prius series hybrid vehicles in 1997. Toyota brought up the new hybrid technology in the Prius when fuel prices were going up at a massive rate.

But what is regenerative braking? There are still many people confused about what it is, whether it is safe or helpful in fuel economy in hybrid cars and the regeneration of electricity in electric cars.
In simple terms, regen braking is when a car saves energy by recharging its battery when you brake, helping it use less fuel or electricity and go further. Easy but scientifically, regen braking is a process used in vehicles where the kinetic energy produced during braking is converted into electrical energy through an electric motor acting as a generator. This electrical energy is then stored in the vehicle’s battery for later use, reducing energy wastage and increasing overall efficiency.
Photo: Freepik
Regen braking can be seen in all kinds of EVs, including cars, scooters, commercial vans, buses, bicycles, three-wheelers, and rickshaws. It now can be electrically managed to what extent the power and braking can be generated. 
Regenerative Braking work process in EV

Principle of Operation: Regene braking works by turning the energy from slowing down into electricity.
Electric Motor as a Generator: In EV or hybrid cars with regen braking, the motor changes roles from moving the car to making electricity when you brake.
Switching Polarity: When you brake, the motor switches directions, turning energy from the wheels into electricity instead of using it to move the car.
Generation of Electricity: The turning wheels make the motor produce electricity, which goes to the car’s battery.
Power Electronics: Special electronics change the electricity from the motor into the right kind for charging the battery.
Battery Charging: The electricity made during braking charges up the car’s battery, storing the energy for later.
Integration with Hydraulic Braking System: Regenerative braking works with the regular brakes, blending them for smooth stopping.

Advantages and Disadvantages of Regenerative Braking 
The advantages are listed below:

Energy Efficiency: Regenerative braking efficiently captures the kinetic energy generated during braking, effectively reducing energy wastage and contributing to a more sustainable driving experience.
Extended Range: By using the energy that would otherwise be lost during braking as heat and sound, regenerative braking helps to extend the driving range of electric vehicles in instances such as travelling downhill. 
Reduced Brake Wear: Regenerative braking minimizes the strain on traditional braking components, mitigating wear and tear, and potentially extending the lifespan of the braking components such as brake pads, rotors and brake lines, thus reducing maintenance costs over time.
Enhanced Driving Experience: Regenerative braking provides a smoother braking experience and a more responsive feel to drivers, enhancing overall driving comfort and control on the road.

The disadvantages are listed below:

Limited Effectiveness at Low Speeds: While regenerative braking efficiently recaptures energy during braking, its effectiveness diminishes at lower speeds which leads to decreased energy recovery compared to higher speeds.
Complexity and Cost: Implementing regenerative braking adds complexity and cost to vehicle systems, potentially raising manufacturing and maintenance expenses, and impacting consumer affordability.
Maintenance Requirements: Regenerative braking systems require periodic maintenance and calibration to ensure they operate optimally.
Efficiency Variability: Regenerative braking may exhibit variability in efficiency under extreme weather conditions or on certain road surfaces, leading to fluctuations in overall energy recapture and impacting the vehicle’s efficiency.

Misconceptions

Fully Recharges Battery: Some mistakenly believe that regenerative braking fully replenishes the battery, but in reality, it only adds a modest amount of charge.
Increases Braking Distances: There is a misconception that regenerative braking extends braking distances, but it enhances braking performance by complementing traditional brakes.
High-Speed Only: While more effective at higher speeds, regenerative braking still functions at lower speeds, such as during city driving or stop-and-go traffic.
Maintenance-Free: Despite requiring less maintenance than traditional brakes, regen braking systems still need periodic checks and maintenance to ensure proper operation.
Significantly Boosts Range: While regen braking contributes to extending the driving range of electric vehicles, its impact is influenced by various factors beyond just braking efficiency.
Only for Electric Cars: Although commonly associated with electric vehicles, regen braking systems are also found in some conventional vehicles, particularly those aiming to improve fuel efficiency with advanced technology.

Regenerative braking might sound complicated, but it is pretty cool. Think of it as a way for EVs and hybrids to recycle energy when they slow down. Instead of just wasting that energy, regenerative braking turns it into electricity, which can then be used to power the battery."

Nepal crash out of SAFF Championship after losing 2-0 to India
","The snow leopard rescued from Urlabari is currently being kept at the Central Zoo in Lalitpur. Photo: Aryan Dhimal
As the gates to the vet clinic at the Central Zoo in Lalitpur opened, more than two dozen photojournalists thronged the facility and surrounded a metal cage aiming their DSLR cameras at a snow leopard inside.
“Please don’t come close to the animal,” the zoo’s vet, Radha Krishna Gharti, told approaching photojournalists. But in the gush of excitement to take exclusive photographs of the elusive cat, difficult to spot even in its prime habitats, there were few takers for the word of caution.
Nepal’s Department of National Parks and Wildlife Conservation (DNPWC) organised the photo-op two days after the male subadult cat, which was until recently found in the country only at altitudes higher than 2,000-6,000 metres above sea level, was brought to the zoo from Urlabari town(146 m above sea level). According to the department, the animal has sustained injuries to its right foreleg and cannot stand upright.
Although officials involved said they are looking at releasing the animal into the wild after it recuperates, doing so will be a daunting task, adding that the zoo may be the only place where it can now survive.
Not a wild cat

“Nepali snow leopard experts have come up with two hypotheses to explain how the animal from the mountains landed up in the plains,” said Sharad Chandra Adhikari, member-secretary at the National Trust for Nature Conservation (NTNC), a semi-government body that manages the zoo in Lalitpur, a town in the Kathmandu Valley. 
The first of the two hypotheses made public during the photo-op-cum-press conference, is that it was raised in captivity and somehow managed to escape into the wild. The second is that it lost its orientation while trying to establish its territory after separating from its mother.
Kulbhushansingh Suryawanshi, director of the India program, Snow Leopard Trust, said that both hypotheses are plausible explanations as to how the snow leopard got to the plains in Nepal.
A DNPWC official, who wished to remain anonymous as he is not authorised to talk to the press, said that it was more likely that the animal had been raised in captivity. 
“The way it sipped the water and ate the food zoo staff offered indicates that it may have been raised in captivity,” the official said.
Snow leopards are shy cats living at extreme altitudes in the steep mountainous areas of 12 countries in Central and South Asia. Their global population spread over altitudes of 500-5,800 m, is estimated to be between around 3,900 and 6,000 as detailed coordinated surveys of the population in the range countries are yet to be carried out. In Nepal, their population divided into three blocks (eastern, central and western) is estimated to be between 301 and 400.
Adhikari from NTNC said that researchers will now examine the animal’s scat to analyse its diet and try to find out whether it was roaming in the wild or had been in some sort of captivity. Researchers are also preparing to analyse its genes to try to find out to which of the three metapopulations in Nepal it belongs. They will also observe the animal’s canine teeth and fur to look for clues.
Relocation challenge

The whole process could take a few months to complete, and summer could set in in Kathmandu by then, officials concede. 
“The current temperature in Kathmandu is suitable for snow leopards, as we are in the peak of winter,” said Madhu Chetri, a snow leopard researcher from NTNC. But that could change as spring season begins in the Northern Hemisphere.
The DNPWC official said that regardless of the findings related to how the animal got to Urlabarli, the animal would have spent a significant amount of time with humans during its recovery phase. “That would mean that it would have gotten habituated with having humans around,” the official said.
Sending such animals back into the wild is a challenge, as they may have lost their hunting and other adaptation skills, he added. In May last year, officials at the Chitwan National Park released two rescued rhino calves into the wild, with limited success. The safety of the animals, which had gotten used to having humans around, was compromised as poachers could easily approach and kill them. Eventually, they were transferred to an enclosure in eastern Nepal away from human intervention.
Veteran conservationist Professor Karan Bahadur Shah said that rewilding the snow leopard would be a daunting task, as the animals are territorial. “If we just leave the animal in its natural habitat, it will get killed by other snow leopards defending their territory,” he said. “The best option would be to keep the animal in the zoo for the public to see.”
But Nepal’s Central Zoo has its own set of problems. The facility, established in 1932 as a private collection, has limited space and has frequently run into financial trouble. Conservationists say the snow leopard would need special facilities to cater to its needs.
“If the government decides that the snow leopard needs to remain at the zoo, we are ready to shoulder the responsibility,” said Adhikari. “We have set up special facilities for animals such as the red panda and chimpanzees,” he said. “We can do that for the snow leopard as well.”
Those advocating for keeping the animal in the zoo also said that Nepal is a snow leopard range country and the public, especially the young generation, also needs to see the different animals found in the country. “It has great educational value,” said Shah.
Snow leopard expert Suryawanshi from neighbouring India also said that it would be challenging to release the animal into the wild. 
“If the team at the zoo can establish the exact cause of this behaviour [why it ventured into the plains] and can keep the animal away from human contact, then it might be okay to release it back,” he said. “But otherwise, there is little hope for it in the wild. Better to let it live in the zoo.”
Back at the zoo, after the photojournalists are done taking photos, it is the turn of the reporters to point their smartphones at the animal. Then there is a contingent of senior wildlife department officials waiting in line to catch a glimpse of the animal. 
“So much for keeping it away from human contact,” a conservationist observing the hullabaloo from a distance said.

ICC Cricket World Cup Qualifier: Netherlands knock Nepal out of the tournament
","The National Assembly was formed to give experienced people a chance to be part of the parliament and help during the formation of important bills. In countries that follow the Westminster model of government, the upper house plays an important role. That, however, is not the case in Nepal as the country’s upper house has become a platform where individuals secure positions in the National Assembly based on their connections. As the election nears, many once again question the relevance and existence of the upper house.
Things were different in the past as the initial years of the National Assembly saw experienced politicians and experts others in their field be nominated for the post. That slowly changed as the first batch completed its two-year term.
“I understand why people are frustrated with the upper house. People expected experts but all we got was party cadres who lacked knowledge or experience,” says Bimala Rai Paudyal a National Assembly member. “Considering such behaviour and practices, what distinguishes the House of Representatives from the National Assembly?”
A loser’s second chance 
Narayan Kaji Shrestha, who faced defeat in the 2017 general election from Gorkha-2, was elected as a member of the National Assembly on January 23, 2020. Elected from Gandaki Province, Shrestha currently is the Deputy Prime Minister and Home Minister of the country.
Bhagwati Neupane who lost the election from Gandaki province and Bimala Ghimire who lost the election for mayorship in Bhanu Municipality also shared the same trajectory.
Similarly, Mrigendra Kumar Singh Yadav and Jag Prasad Sharma were defeated in the House of Representatives elections, from Saptari-4 and Dang-3 respectively are now members of the National Assembly. Bam Dev Gautam, who lost the elections from Bardiya, secured a place in the upper house through nomination by President Bidya Devi Bhandari.
Even those who did not win as ward member(s) got the opportunity to become members of the National Assembly including Sindh Bahadur Bishwakarma who was appointed on February 7, 2018. He is soon leaving his post on March 3.
Despite the repeated criticisms, the political parties have not paid attention to this concern posed by political leaders and the general public. The latest proof of this is the list of candidates for the National Assembly elections scheduled on January 25. The list contains names like Krishna Prasad Sitaula, defeated in the House of Representatives elections in 2022 from Koshi Province, and Pooja Chaudhary, who lost in the provincial assembly elections 2022 from Rautahat-3 (a).
Speaker Ganesh Prasad Timilsina, who led the National Assembly for the entire six years under the federal system, is also dissatisfied with the individuals who have made it to the upper house. 
“The allegations are something for the parties to ponder upon. The leaders should have prioritised involving intellectuals/neutrals rather than managing its members,” he says.
The 59-member National Assembly elects eight representatives, equally from all seven provinces, with an additional three individuals nominated by the President. The Constitution ensures representation of women, Dalits, minorities or disabled communities, envisioning that experts, experienced individuals, and the most qualified people from various fields will become members of the National Assembly.
Easy way in
File: A National Assembly meeting
There are some reasons why leaders aspire to join the upper house, and even the leadership create opportunities for them. 
In National Assembly elections, voters consist of local-level heads/deputy heads and provincial assembly members. Typically, individuals seeking these positions undergo a vetting process by their respective parties. As a result, aspiring members of parliament can focus less on persuading individual voters and more on gaining party support to secure their candidacy. 
Moreover, being a member of the National Assembly opens avenues to ministerial roles. The constitution prohibits a National Assembly member from becoming the Prime Minister, but not Deputy Prime Minister. Due to such opportunities, leaders are enticed to seek a position in the assembly.
The National Assembly is currently in its fourth election cycle since the promulgation of the Consitution in 2015. Scheduled for January 25, this election aims to fill 19 seats vacated by individuals completing their six-year terms. The previous election cycles took place in 2017, involving 56 members, followed by 2019 with 18 positions, and 2020 with 19 positions.
The cascading impacts
File: A National Assembly meeting
Another reason why the National Assembly is finding it difficult to justify itself is that it has become a shadow of the House of Representatives. The meeting of the National Assembly did not have one session when the House of Representatives was dissolved by then Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli twice. The demands and issues raised by the opposition parties in the House of Representatives automatically went to the National Assembly, where the parliamentarians of the ruling party put forward any proposal, they endorse it the same as in the House of Representatives.
The latest example – is the main opposition UML did not allow the meeting of the House of Representatives to continue for five days from July 5, 2023, due to a statement made by Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal during his visit to India. Consequently, the meeting of the National Assembly was also paused during that period.
The UML obstructed the House of Representatives for almost a month starting mid-July last year demanding a high-level inquiry committee to probe the 60-kilogram gold smuggling case and the resignation of the Home Minister. The National Assembly followed suit with leaders pushing their agendas forward.
Speaker Ganesh Timilsina himself is dissatisfied that every behaviour and activity of the House of Representatives influence the National Assembly. He says despite his attempts to prevent the overshadowing, it has been unfortunate that he did not garner the goodwill of the top leaders during political disputes.
Reinstating power
The National Assembly is a permanent institution. Therefore, it can remain operational even in the absence of the House of Representatives. Under normal circumstances, Speaker Timilsina initiated a positive practice by personally participating in different committees. Nevertheless, in the absence of the House of Representatives, the National Assembly often experienced inactivity.
In December 2020, the Prime Minister at that time, KP Sharma Oli, dissolved the House of Representatives. Subsequently, a session of the National Assembly was convened on January 1, 2021. Despite lasting only seven hours over four days, this session, which took place after the dissolution, failed to address crucial public issues. Even after six months, important matters remained unaddressed within the House.
On May 22, 2021, the UML-led government once again dissolved the House of Representatives. The meeting of the National Assembly and committees was affected once more. However, the dissolutions were declared unconstitutional by the Supreme Court, reinstating the parliament.
The Constitution says that despite the closing of the National Assembly session, thematic committee meetings can still take place. However, both the National Assembly and its committees remained inactive until the restoration of the House of Representatives.
According to Khimlal Devkota, a member of the National Assembly, when the House of Representatives was dissolved twice, it seemed that the National Assembly was also in a state of dissolution.
Bimala Rai Paudyal also believes that the inability to resume the upper house is a mark of weakness. 
“Since the government was not in a position to call, the President needed to be consulted by the chair together with the consultation committee. That was not done either,” she says.
Constitutional and legal distinctions

Except for the Constitution of Nepal (1962) and the Interim Constitution of Nepal (2007), all other constitutions in Nepal provided for a bicameral parliament with the National Assembly or the Upper House and the House of Representatives or the Lower House. The practices before 2015 were under the unitary governance system, but after the adoption of the federal democratic republican governance system, the role of the National Assembly has changed somewhat.
In the preamble of the constitution prepared by the ‘Constituent Assembly, and Administrative Organ Designation Committee’ during the drafting of the constitution, it is mentioned that some different qualifications have been prescribed for being a member of the House of Representatives and the National Assembly, with the intention that qualified people can be represented in the National Assembly.
Chair of the National Assembly Ganesh Prasad Timilsina restates that the members of the upper house should be assessed based on the country’s expectations with clear criteria. 
There is no definite definition of an expert in the constitution. It has been stated symbolically, “…It is expected that the members should have some basic skills to face the challenges and fulfil their responsibilities.”
According to the constitution, the responsibility of the National Assembly is to correctly establish the rights of the local level, state, and union, and to prevent the House of Representatives from trying to enact laws contrary to the spirit of federalism. There is an explanatory comment in the constitution about the propriety of the National Assembly – “This House is expected to fulfil its role to maintain creative and mutual relations between the national government and the provinces.”
In addition, there are some constitutional and legal differences regarding the National Assembly. But the MPs are demanding that it should cease. When a bill originating in the House of Representatives is passed and sent to the National Assembly, and if the latter does not decide within 60 days, it proceeds de facto.
This has placed the National Assembly in a dilemma. The Chairman of the National Assembly, Timilsina, says, “Such an arrangement should also apply to the House of Representatives, or both should be equal.”
Need for course correction 
PM Pushpa Kamal Dahal speaking in the National Assembly meeting.
Some instances have turned these so-called experts into a laughing stock due to their actions. 
On July 5, 2023,  a discussion on the Electronic Commerce (E-Commerce) Bill 2023 was tabled in the National Assembly. However, the parliamentarians misunderstood the main point and instead discussed the matter of electricity. The MPs, who had not read the proposal, suggested that electricity consumption within Nepal should also be increased besides exporting electricity to India and Bangladesh.
During the meeting, Ramesh Rijal, the Minister of Industry, Commerce and Supplies, also mentioned that India would purchase electricity during the Prime Minister’s visit. Unfortunately, the bill was unanimously approved.
Timilsina considers the incident an example, that in his six-year tenure, he does not want to remember. Som Bahadur Thapa, a former secretary at the Parliament Secretariat, termed the incident ‘a joke’ in the Parliament of Nepal. 
“This is strong proof of the kind of MPs we have, who speak without knowing what they are talking about.” 
Timilsina assumed the role of the speaker/chair of the National Assembly after the establishment of the Federal Democratic Republic. He had the opportunity to establish the system and the dignity of the National Assembly. However, instead of setting a positive example, he will soon be retiring after being accused of playing tricks with the Speaker and showing interest in the work of the House of Representatives.
Timilsina has repeatedly commented on the affairs of the House of Representatives. The latest instance was during a seminar on ‘Japan: Past, Present, and Future’ held in the capital on December 2, 2023, he publicly stated that the election results of the House of Representatives did not bode well.
Pointing to the emergence of a new party and the victory of some independent candidates, he said, “In a democracy, you get to choose candidates, irrespective of their party affiliation. However, is the signal positive?”
In August/ September 2022, Timilsina wrote a letter to the Election Commission, urging them to extend the tenure of Speaker and Deputy Speaker. Upon receiving a response stating that the Commission would not determine the tenure of the elected Parliament, Timilsina directed the Parliament Secretariat not to execute decisions made by the Management Committee after September 17, 2022.
This created conflict between the Speaker of the House of Representatives and the Speaker of the National Assembly and in the crux of this dispute between the parties, the country had to bear the consequences of this conflict. Laws could not be enacted promptly, and the place once considered the domain of experts was overshadowed by the party’s interest. 
A study conducted by the Democracy Resource Center Nepal (DRCN) on the legislative functioning of the National Assembly has revealed that the Upper House has passed some bills that go against the spirit of federalism.
The report’s concluding remarks say, “…the bills passed by the House of Representatives have not undergone significant changes or discussions in the National Assembly. The conclusion section of the study states that – “Furthermore, some bills, contradicting the spirit of federalism and addressing the interests of interest groups, have been approved by the National Assembly.”
Overall, in the last six years, parties have introduced individuals who, given their presentation level, have raised questions about the National Assembly’s justification. If there are no changes in the constitution, laws, and policies concerning the upper assembly, these concerns will persist.”"

While most of the nation was preparing for the festival of lights, Tihar in early November 2023, something no less exciting was fuelling our sparks from oceans away. A queer art festival was happening for the seventeenth year and we had a chance to attend it as delegates. Our delegation was made possible through the collaboration between the Outburst Arts, an art organisation based in Northern Ireland, UK and the British Council, Nepal.
There is a clear distinction between cities in terms of their flourishing arts scenes, and this became apparent during a visit to Belfast, Northern Ireland, specifically for the Outburst Queer Arts Festival held in the charming city centre. The organisation of such a festival requires months of careful preparation and planning.
The queer art festival started as short events lasting a few days. Now, after 17 years, it has grown into a ten-day festival with panel discussions, theatre performances, and exhibitions. Program guides were available at venues, partner hotels, local libraries, and shops. Many delegates, including us, came from outside Northern Ireland to attend.
During the queer art festival, we had the opportunity to connect with art curators, publishers, artists, and representatives from other British Council departments around the world (Lithuania, France, South Africa, Turkey, Greece, Jordan, England, and Argentina to name a few.) 
Each event that we attended gave us a different insight into what the arts can do and how it can facilitate connections. We gained insights from queer publishers and art curators on the challenges they face in their own countries due to resources and sometimes from bureaucracy in systems. We also got to see the way people can thrive when given a platform to showcase their works, such as an art exhibition in which the artist reimagined intimacy for queer people.
On the other hand, Nepal struggles by and large at times for queer visibility. There are no explicit spaces for SOGIESC (Sexual Orientation, Gender Identity and Expressions and Sex Characteristics) artists to showcase their works nor openly come together as a community, it all exists in pocket spaces. In the same way, something that struck us was the presence of older queer artists at the festival. 
It was not just for one particular event during the queer art festival. We noticed an active participation and involvement of older queer people throughout the festival there. It was fascinating to see queer artists in their 40s and 50s share their transformative and inspiring work. Whereas, back home, the queer folks at the forefront of queer art, advocacy and activism are mostly Gen-Zs and millennials. We have very few queer elders that we can count on our fingers who are diligently working for Nepali queer folks. Even among them, some still hold onto archaic notions and refuse to evolve and embrace changes. So, there’s that.

Before being selected as delegates, both of us joined online meetings with British Council Nepal and the Outburst representatives facilitated through Kaalo 101 (an art space in Patan), along with interested queer artists from Nepal. We had a total of three meetings where we discussed the possibilities and challenges of doing a queer art festival in Nepal. 
The discourse also entailed us sharing a presentation about the updates of the queer art scene in Nepal in the last five years. The updates included memorable leaps taken in queer arts from music to literature and fashion and more by artists from diverse walks of life. Days after the third meeting, the British Council extended invitations to us to attend the Outburst Queer Arts Festival.
Our delegation is just one example of the transcontinental collaboration because it was something that happened for the first time and involved us. But, Outburst Arts and the British Council have been practising cross-continental collaboration for years. Even in this year’s festival, we witnessed a lot of artists from different continents work together in exhibitions, lectures, panel discussions, magazines and so on. The amalgamation introduced us to brilliant thought-provoking work that defies gender and sociopolitical norms. The power of transcontinental collaboration was beyond beautiful.
Imagining queer arts in Nepal

The queer art scene in Nepal is an emerging one. While a full-fledged festival may not be possible now, something small yet significant is achievable. Time and again, different organisations have been running large art exhibitions/tours for weeks and months. However, in the microcosm that is Nepal, especially Kathmandu, the capital is no stranger to art-oriented programs. What it has been unfamiliar with precisely is queer art. And the unfamiliarity is not something induced by the lack of queer artists and their art. Sadly, it is because of inadequate platforms, space and resources to pursue queer arts.
Despite this, through the years there have been events and literature that have emerged centring on queer identity, but it has not come without its challenges. On collections of stories, “Pride Climbing Higher” and “Songs of Revolution” showcase stories from Nepalis across Nepal. There are not many stories reflecting the Nepali queer experiences otherwise. 
June Pride Parade by Queer Youth Group has gained momentum as well in the past few years since its conception, from a small gathering to now a large parade with performances from community members. The same can be said about Blue Diamond Society’s (BDS) Rainbow Visibility Pride events in August during the festival of Saa-Paru (Gai Jatra) which has been running for well over a decade; in recent years they have included flash mobs and interaction programmes as well in lead up to their parade. Individuals within the community have also organised their queer gatherings with friends, thus coming back to the cosmos of pocket spaces in celebrating queerness.
While artists like us are creative with what we want to put out, we still need organisations like the British Council to foster spaces and connections to enable us to do that. Then and again, artists have come together and collaborated on queer-centric projects. But, we need funding and resources to achieve bigger-scale projects that unite more artists and transcend borders.
Both of us advocate for queer rights and are involved in programs and activities that push the narrative further, extend the visibility of the community and normalise conversations surrounding queerness. Among other things, we are also the founders of Queering The Bond, a networking collective for Nepali queer folks and Shuby is also the founder of Queer Honky-Tonk, a platform to promote queer performances and networking with events such as a drag show or open mic every few months. However, both of us, individually or collaboratively can only do so much. 

The challenges of living in a capitalistic world oftentimes outweigh the passion we have for the queer art scene in Nepal. And this is where we expect the government and organisations to step up with policies, platforms and programs to provide spaces, opportunities and resources for queer artists. Here, the British Council joined hands with Outburst Arts, which paved the way for our delegation. We would not have known about the marvellous queer art festival at the other end of the world otherwise.
Besides the limitations brought by insufficient spaces and social unawareness, the centralised capital does hinder queer artists from outside the city to connect, create and collaborate. Art already is centralised and elitist. On top of that, the concentrated Kathmandu Valley is of no help when it comes to making art accessible beyond its borders.
Furthermore, there is also the expectation from basically everyone to have the perfect festival that caters to all people’s needs and wants. While the festival, if it should happen, is bound to be done with the right intentions, there is a lot of pressure for the first-time event itself. The festival will be inclusive and diverse. But, realistically speaking, it would be a struggle to make it relevant to each queer person from east to west.
Speaking of struggles, a visceral feeling of uneasiness swarmed over me with each step I took while exiting the airport after the flight back home. I, Birat, personally felt that I could not be as free or unrestrained in Nepal as I was during my time in Belfast. No wonder a lot of the queer people we know opt for abroad.
Seventeen years ago, when the Outburst Queer Arts Festival first began, it certainly was not as celebrated or large as it is now. What we are trying to convey here is that we do not have to start big. We can aim for something small yet promising. While there might be expectations to check all the boxes, it is crucial to be mindful of our capacity as well. But, we can be capacitated and this is where you – people in power, art enthusiasts, grant and resource allocators and media come in. It is time we all believe in Nepali queer art and create space for it to not only survive but thrive. It is imperative to understand that formulating our imagination into reality can only be possible through unwavering collaboration."

Sabitra Bhandari: South Asia’s best looking to take the Israeli league by storm
","The month of January saw major road accidents in different parts of the country, including Lamhi in Dang, Dhorpatan in Baglung, and Chandragiri in Kathmandu. Road accidents have been common throughout the country with Nepal Police data suggesting over 2,500 people dying in them annually. Despite this, the Ministry of Finance has shown reluctance to introduce the proposed Road Safety Bill to reduce traffic accidents, fatalities, and serious injuries, and enhance road safety. 
Instead, the Finance Ministry has asked the Ministry of Physical Infrastructure and Transport to include the proposed bill in the Public Roads Act. Along with that, the government’s initiative to pass dedicated laws on road safety and set up a mechanism, including the empowered National Road Safety Council (NRSC), to decrease accidents, has come to a halt.
Keshav Kumar Sharma, secretary of the Ministry of Physical Infrastructure and Transport, says they asked for a dedicated road safety law that comprehensively addresses institutional arrangements was the need of the hour. This includes ensuring safety in road construction, promoting public awareness, providing training and communication facilities, implementing rescue mechanisms, and arranging rehabilitation for families affected by road accidents. However, the Ministry of Finance believes a separate law is unnecessary due to concerns about potential increased financial burden.
Hourly need

Officials from the Ministry of Physical Infrastructure allege that the Ministry of Finance is approaching sensitive matters, such as passenger safety, solely from an economic standpoint. They say that concerns related to road, vehicle, and passenger safety are being overshadowed, and there are indications that this approach will continue. 
“The government is avoiding addressing the sensitive issue of road accidents and the associated human and material costs, fearing an increase in expenses. This contradicts the government’s commitment and policy to reduce traffic accidents in the future,” says an official from the Ministry of Physical Infrastructure on the condition of anonymity.
According to the Ministry of Physical Infrastructure, the existing laws lack the vision and purpose necessary for developing a sustainable, safe, risk-free, and reliable transportation operation and security system. Therefore, the Ministry of Physical Infrastructure officials argue that a distinct law is essential to decrease road accidents and ensure the safety of pedestrians, including passenger transport workers and roadside residents, as well as pets, wild animals, and birds. 
“The Road Safety Act is the need of the hour as it will help us during post-accident rescue, treatment management, rehabilitation, and legal representation,” says the official.
Currently, there are gaps in enforcing road rules, monitoring vehicle capacities, ensuring road structure safety, managing traffic signs, and organizing road safety facilities. The implementation of the Road Safety Act is seen as crucial to address these issues.
However, there has not been a facilitative environment for providing education and raising awareness about road traffic safety, safety mechanisms, and coordinating among organisations related to road transport. The aspect of training drivers with skills and knowledge, as well as monitoring road safety on the roads, is also lacking. This is why experts have been suggesting introducing a separate road safety law to address these aspects.
The Finance Ministry, however, says that road safety should not be downplayed by ignoring human sensibilities related to road safety and citing economic reasons. Officials from the Ministry of Physical Infrastructure argue that incorporating safety considerations in the Road Act does not automatically result in a decrease in accidents or the integration of post-accident rescue, relief, and rehabilitation efforts.
“The existing laws do not address road safety anywhere. Due to its lack of clarity and inadequacy, it has not been implemented with due diligence. For instance, provisions such as those for vehicle inspectors outlined in the Transport Act have not been acted upon by the government,” says an official from the Transport Ministry.
Policies and commitments, but no laws

The Motor Vehicles and Transport Management Act (1993) includes several provisions related to vehicle registration, road permits, driver’s licenses, traffic management, insurance, and penalties. The Public Roads Act (1974) primarily focuses on road management. However, there is no provision in the Act regarding the National Road Safety Council.
In this situation, Nepal has developed a 10-year road safety action plan but is yet to enact corresponding legislation. Unfortunately, government agencies and mechanisms are not obligated to follow the action plan, as it lacks legal guidance.
Now, the Transport Ministry holds the view that if safety considerations are explicitly addressed in the Public Roads Act, the outcome will not differ from what the Finance Ministry has said. Given the Public Roads Act’s close association with the Department of Road, the ministry thinks greater emphasis will be placed on road construction. However, they argue that incorporating the road safety aspect into the Act would not be effective.
Secretary Sharma of the Transport Ministry is tasked with ensuring road safety, overseeing physical infrastructure and transport, and coordinating efforts across education, health, home, law, federal affairs, and general administration ministries. This responsibility extends to provincial ministries, local levels, as well as various agencies, organisations, security agencies, non-governmental organisations, and related entities, each with their specific roles.
“As all the agencies need to be allocated responsibilities for various aspects of road safety, we have requested them to collaborate in formulating a distinct law. This should encompass the reduction of all types of accidents,” said Sharma.
The ministry believes that a dedicated law addressing road safety is crucial to mitigate severe road accidents in Nepal and to uphold the commitments made by the country on the international stage.
Nepal has committed to implementing the Stockholm Declaration through the Global Road Traffic Safety Conference in 2020, as per the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. Nepal, which has incorporated sustainable development goals into its national development plan, has not yet commenced work aligned with these objectives.

Nevertheless, Nepal’s neighbouring countries are already addressing road safety through legal frameworks. Various states in India have enacted road safety laws, and the effectiveness of these laws is contributing to a 50 per cent reduction in road accidents.
In 1999, Bhutan also introduced a unified road safety and transport act. Pakistan, on the other hand, issued the National Highway Safety Ordinance-2000 to ensure road safety, distinct from its National Highway Authority Act (1991). Britain, Australia, America, New Zealand, and other countries have established separate road safety laws as well.
Road safety neglected
In Nepal, road safety has been consistently neglected due to the absence of dedicated legislation. Road safety expert Keshav Adhikari says that the government primarily focused on road construction, overlooks crucial aspects such as road safety and reinforcement. Consequently, roads are transforming into perilous pathways for both vehicles and passengers.
“There is a lack of interest in formulating policies and laws aimed at mitigating financial losses resulting from accidents,” says Adhikari.
He further points out that safety is not a governmental priority, as expanding the road network is perceived to yield more political benefits than implementing additional structures to enhance road safety.
“When I worked as an expert in the Transport Ministry for over a year, I realised that promoting road safety is not a government priority,” he says. “Annually, more people die due to road accidents than those who die in natural disasters, but the government has not given it much attention.”
Even though the prime minister, ministers, and MPs keep asserting that roads have been constructed, no one seems to be addressing the critical issues of road safety and quality.
Saroj Sitaula, General Secretary of the Federation of Nepalese National Transport Entrepreneurs (FNNTE), says that the government must be attentive as accidents are on the rise due to various technical and human factors, including road infrastructure. 
“Many accidents can be mitigated by improving road conditions, installing barriers on the sides, putting up informational boards, and ensuring scientific and practical road markings,” he says. “We need to formulate a plan and progress accordingly.”
Sitaula argues that the government should establish policies to create mechanisms for emergency rescue, treatment, and rehabilitation after an accident occurs. He emphasises the importance of enhancing road infrastructure, conducting a scientific examination of the technical condition of vehicles, and ensuring compliance with the law by drivers, passengers, and regulators. He says that blaming drivers and transport entrepreneurs for accidents is inadequate, and the government must fulfil its responsibilities.
Roads are unsafe

Nepal currently boasts a road network spanning approximately 100,000 km, with the majority consisting of dirt and gravel roads. Among the more than 22,000 kilometres of national and subsidiary highways, numerous sections remain unpaved.
Despite the government’s substantial investment in road construction and expansion, minimal efforts are allocated to ensuring road safety. 
Recently, all three levels of government have accelerated the widening of roads, incorporating asphalt and slopes. However, it appears that issues concerning road quality and safety are escalating at a faster pace. Roads that have been neglected in the guise of maintenance have become a nightmare for the public.
Infrastructure expert Suryaraj Acharya notes that these problems arise due to the tendency to construct roads only after they have sustained damage, without considering potential issues during the initial construction phase."

Realme has launched its popular mid-range number series smartphone, the Realme 12 Pro series. The series includes the Realme 12 Pro 5G and the Realme 12 Pro+ 5G which are the successors of the Realme 11 Pro+ 5G and Realme 11 Pro 5G respectively. The Realme 11 series was widely appreciated for its design and performance at the price range. 
The 12 series has stepped up the game with an even better design. Realme has not only changed the design but has also upgraded the performance and the camera to compete in the mid-range price market. Realme recently has been focusing a lot on the design aspect and the price range performance. 
The 12 Pro+ has some major differences from last year’s 11 Pro+ which include design, IP rating, chipset, camera and charging. 
Let us see what the luxuriously designed smartphone delivers in terms of specs.

ICC Cricket World Cup Qualifier: Nepal beat US by 6 wickets
","Ram Bujhaun Yadav with his land ownership certificate stands near a border pillar which he says was erroneously placed on his land. 
In October 2023, when 51-year-old Ram Bujhaun Yadav of Musaharnia Rural Municipality-5, Mukhiyapatti, Dhanusha, was at a relative’s house, someone told him that two Indian Sashastra Seema Bal (SSB) personnel were looking for him.
Anxious, he rushed home wondering why they were looking for him.
“They asked me if the paddy field in the no man’s land was mine. I told them yes and they asked me to cut down the paddy immediately,” he said.
The paddy was not ripe and Yadav asked them for some time. However, the SSB personnel told him he had to cut down his paddy immediately.
Ram Bujhaun and his wife Tetari Devi each own a 677-square-metre plot of land. As Nepal and India reevaluated the border, Ram Bujhan’s land was been deemed to be near the no man’s land as it now has two demarcation pillars.
Frustrated, Ram Bujhaun cut the paddy before it was due to be harvested. Now, he has been asked to not plant anything on the land as it falls in the no man’s land.
“Our border police don’t say a word. I can’t fight the SSB on my own,” says Ram Bujhaun adding he had decided not to plan anything on the land anymore.
Woes of the farmers
Many farmers in southern Nepal say their land has now been placed in India after the recent demarcation. 
When the Jamuna River, which flows through the no man’s land between Nepal and India, changed its course some two decades ago, some border pillars went missing. Locals say these pillars have now been placed encroaching on Nepali land.
In 2018, with the then Chief District Officer of Dhanusha, Pradeep Raj Kandel, and an official from Madhubani district, Bihar, India, a team that included border security forces from both countries, the Armed Police Force of Nepal, and SSB of India began placing border pillars after land measurement by technicians.
Locals have raised concerns, stating that border pillars have been positioned, encroaching approximately 50 to 100 meters of land into Nepal compared to the previous position. Many like Ram Bujhaun are unaware of when these border pillars were placed.
“I did not know that pillar was placed here. After I found out when I asked the village leaders, many said they were placing the border pillars as they pleased,” said Ram Bujhaun.
He was told to carry on planting paddy and that it would not matter as these issues had happened in the past. 
“They encroached on my land and have asked me not to plant anything. This is gross injustice,” he says.
Ram Bujhaun’s family owns a total of 4,000 square metres of land, with 2,000 square metres belonging to him and the remaining 2,000 square metres to his brother Bechan. However, 1,000 square metres of his land is now located on the Indian side after the demarcation. Despite this, he has been farming on the land and continues to pay taxes to the Department of Land Management and Archive in Nepal.
“They have marked my land to be on the Indian side and placed border pillars on it. I’ve been farming till now but I don’t know when they will ask me to stop,” he says.
Ignorance of the government
The Madhesh province in southern Nepal
The former ward chair of Mukhiyapatti Musharniya Rural Municipality-5, Ram Naresh Yadav, said that over time, India has encroached on numerous Nepali lands in various locations in the Madhesh Province. This, he says, happened due to the Nepali administration’s ignorance and weak stature.
“They (Nepali administration) were careless and that meant the Indian side placed these border pillars by encroaching on Nepali land,” says Ram Naresh.
He said that over 40 farmers from wards 1, 5, and 6 have land ranging from 300 to 1,600 square metres on the Indian side. 
“These farmers have land ownership certificates, but they cannot farm as the SSB says the land is in India and not Nepal,” said Ram Naresh.
In 1996, land ownership certificates were distributed after surveying the land in the border area. Local Dharmendra Kumar Yadav said that since then, the locals have been paying their land tax regularly. In 2018, when the pillar was being placed, the locals protested when they saw their land was being encroached on. However, since the demarcation had been agreed upon by high-ranking government officials of Nepal and India, the farmer’s voices went unheard.
“We tried to stop when the border pillars were being placed on our land. But the administrators from both sides forcibly put it there without even trying to hold a discussion,” said Harish Chandra Yadav. 
The Chief District Officer of Dhanusha, Chakrapani Pandey, says that the border pillars were placed by the technical team after the measurements and with the agreement of the high-ranking officials of the two countries.
“The fields and houses that are built in no man’s land have recently been cleared. No one can do anything in this particular area,” said Pandey. “We understand the people’s concern but we cannot do anything about it now.”"

Life is filled with surprises and unexpected events and it can change at any moment. The only thing certain in life is the uncertainty. Change is a natural and inevitable part of our lives, and it may be positive as well as negative.
Even though it is not guaranteed that we will wake up in the morning, we set the alarm every night with the hope that we will wake up in the morning. We do not know what each day is going to bring us, but we may have varieties, adventures, and endless opportunities.
The push to explore
The uncertainty sometimes forces us to explore those aspects of life, we never knew existed or needed. It also tests the mental strength of people and how they deal with it. The uncertainty has taught me to be grateful, as we never know what life throws at us.
In life, everything does not go according to our plans, and if we do not embrace the change we will face huge trouble. The Covid-19 pandemic is the best example of uncertainty, we were constantly fearing death and it was uncertain that we would see the sunrise the next day.
It is not certain that every decision in life will be correct, but if you fear not trying at all, you miss endless opportunities for learning and growing. When our decisions or outcomes are on the negative side, we get depressed and we might tend to think about committing suicide, but we forget that if we have life we have endless opportunities. 
Most of us plan for our careers, our love life, etc. and when those plans do not work out we start getting uncomfortable. But if we can deal with today, we can surely deal with tomorrow. We need to cherish little moments in our lives and know that nothing is permanent not even the failures and setbacks.
We come here with nothing and leave with nothing. So why should we hold the egos and grudges against each other? Instead of making our life meaningful and enjoying the journey of life, we get into puzzles of accumulating wealth and we go against our own loved ones for it. 
Change is certain

Nothing is permanent in life, everything can change in fractions of seconds. In today’s society, everyone is so busy, that we people have so less time for our loved ones. What I have learned over the years, is to find time in our busy schedule for our family because we never know when it will be our last day together with them. 
Yes! Death is a natural process, so if you have to die someday, why should you die with grudges in your heart? But instead of worrying about the inevitable, focusing on the things you can control will bring a lot of happiness in life.
Uncertainty is not only a negative thing; it also brings a lot of opportunity because you dare to change. The life-changing experience will not come knocking down your door, you need to expose yourself. We learn by doing and experimenting, even though we might fail. But that is not the end of the world. I still remember hesitating while applying for the role of leadership, at my school level as it was not certain that I would be chosen.
Even after being selected, I was uncertain about whether I could fulfil my responsibilities or not. But that uncertainty helped me grow out of my comfort zone and give my best input. If I had not applied for that role just because I was uncertain of the outcome, I would miss the biggest learning opportunity in my school life. So, do not let the uncertainty or the unknown ever stop you from trying and no matter how much we try, to plan life always finds a way to surprise us. 
It is important to stay grounded when we have everything we wish for because life can take such a turn that we had never expected in our wildest dreams. Similarly, nothing is permanent in life, the financial hardships, the grades, the breakups, etc. But the most important thing is not to lose hope during those difficult times.
According to the data provided by Nepal police, around 6,830 people took their lives in the fiscal year 2022/23. There is nothing in life that cannot be resolved although it may take time, committing suicide should not be an option. It’s important to share feelings among family members or loved ones because together as a family any problem can be overcome.
Embrace the unknown and focus on enhancing your life, instead of worrying about what will happen next. Always find time for your loved ones, as life is uncertain. We should be grateful that we are alive and accept that change is the only constant thing in life. Do not let the unknown, stop you from trying or achieving your goals and always remember that even if you fail, you still have endless opportunities."

Kathmandu, June 18
Hosts Zimbabwe comprehensively beat Nepal by eight wickets in the opening game of the ICC Cricket World Cup Qualifier at Harare Sports Club on June 18.
Having been put to bat by the hosts, Nepal’s openers started the game in an attacking fashion. Kushal Bhurtel took the game to Zimbabwean bowlers attacking every loose delivery. On the other end, Aasif Sheikh played a composed inning as the opening pair put up 171 runs for the first wicket. Bhurtel was unlucky to miss out on a century as he was bowled by Wellington Masakadza for 99.  Sheikh soon followed Bhurtel into the dressing room after a well-made 66.

Despite such a great start, Nepal’s middle order could not capitalise. Despite a 72-run stand between Kushal Malla and Rohit Paudel, who scored 41 and 31 respectively, the team kept losing wickets at regular intervals as Nepal only managed to score 291 in 50 overs.
The score could have gone beyond 300 but Zimbabwe’s Richard Ngarava picked up four wickets to restrict Nepal to a par score.
In reply, Zimbabwe did not get off to the best of starts losing opener Joylord Gumbie early. But a solid partnership between captain Craig Ervine and Wessly Madhevere steadied the innings for the hosts as they put up 82 runs. Madhevere held out to Dipendra Singh Airee as he tried to take on a short delivery from Gulshan Jha.
But Ervine and Sean Williams carried the momentum forward putting up a 164-run stand and taking the hosts home with nearly six overs to spare. Ervine scored an impressive 128 ball 121 while Williams scored a blistering 102 of 70 balls. 
Nepal’s bowling performance was below par, lacking the ability to build pressure, resulting in a comprehensive victory for the hosts.

Role of entrepreneurship education in Nepal’s quest for economic empowerment 
","Church Boys United lift the A Division League trophy at Dashrath Stadium on June 10, 2023. Photo: Chandra Bahadur Ale
A footballer, Tanka Lal Rai aka Reuben, always dreamt of playing in the A Division League. However, despite his relentless efforts, he was unable to fulfil this aspiration. Undeterred by this setback, Rai channelled his passion for the sport and establish Church Boys United in 2009 with the goal of playing in the A Division League.
In 2010, when the team played the knockout tournament to get into the C Division for the first time, Rai captained the team himself. But he found out how tough the road was to get into the C Division and make their way to the top.
It took Church Boys United nearly a decade to get into the C Division but when they did, the club made the most of it.
In their debut season in the C Division in 2021, Church Boys United made an impressive mark by clinching the title. The following season, they continued their fine form and won the B Division in 2022.
Many had felt the team would not be able to continue this trend, but defying the odds, the newly promoted side won the A Division League with one game to spare.
With the unwavering commitment of its players and the relentless efforts of the team management, Church Boys United achieved a remarkable feat by becoming the second team, alongside Manang Marshyangdi Club, to win all three Divisions in their first attempts. This remarkable accomplishment showcases the team’s exceptional performance and solidifies their place in Nepali football history.
“After 15 years of struggle, we have attained this dream. I can’t express this moment in words,” says Rai, president of Church Boys United. 
The three musketeers
Captain Ananta Tamang and striker Anjan Bista were integral to the team winning the league.
When Church Boys United became champion of the B Division they did not have a single marquee player. Not wanting to disrupt the team had done so well, they kept hold of 12 players including their star player Ashish Chaudhary. But to take on heavyweights of Nepali football, the club brought in 16 players including Anjan Bista, Ananta Tamang, Tej Tamang, Dinesh Rajbanshi, Arik Bista and Kamal Shrestha. 
“I was confident about the squad. The team had the potential to win the league. So, I decided to join the team,” says club captain Ananta Tamang. 
Church Boys celebrating winning the B Division League to get promoted to the A Division.
Prior to the commencement of the league, Church Boys United faced setbacks as key players Dinesh Rajbanshi and Tej Tamang departed for Australia. Bista also went to India to take part in the I Leauge. The absence of these players hindered the team during the initial matches. Simultaneously, the team faced another setback as Nepali American coach Pradip Humagain stepped down from his position due to challenges in acquiring a work permit.
Bista joined the team on Matchday 6 while on Matchday 7, the team played without a coach. Bal Gopal Maharjan joined the team on Matchday 8 and did not have the best of starts winning one, drawing two and losing two.
The team experienced a turning point on Matchday 13 when they faced Manang Marsyangdi Club. In a resounding victory, they defeated MMC 3-0, which significantly boosted their confidence.
“It gave us the belief that we could take on anyone,” said Bista.
Church Boys United showed great unity to win the A Division League in their debut season.
Since then one, the team did not look back winning eight of the 13 matches to become champions of Nepal.
Maharjan feels this title was a result of hard work and feels extremely proud of having won it with Bista and Tamang who he has coached since they were teenagers.
During the post-match conference, he sat between them and proudly acknowledged the entire team for their victory, singling out specific individuals for their exceptional contributions.
The club’s President, Rai, attributes the team’s victory to strong leadership and acknowledges the significant roles played by players like Bista and Tamang in achieving success.
“The leadership quality in the field made our team successful,” says Rai, pointing to Tamang, “Furthermore, we were also very strict about discipline. We were successful in maintaining the team’s unity. Foreign players also played well, according to their capacity.” 
Bista expressed his gratitude towards his teammates, team management, and coach, emphasising the strong bond they shared as a family. 
“Our unity played a crucial role in securing the victory,” he says.
Lost opportunity 
Team celebrate winning the A Division League title. 
Winning the A Division is not only a matter of becoming a national champion but also presents clubs with an exciting opportunity to participate in an international tournament.
The league champion earns the privilege of representing Nepal in the AFC Cup, a prestigious tournament organised by the Asian Football Confederation that brings together league champions from across Asia.
But Church Boys United will not be able to take part in the count competition as they do not have an AFC licence. In Nepal, only Machhindra Football Club, Tribhuvan Army Club and Armed Police Force have the AFC licence. As Church Boys United do not have the licence, Machhindra, who finished second in the league, will play in the AFC Cup. 
The players of Church Boys United express their disappointment regarding the missed opportunity to participate in the AFC Cup.
“We have lost the opportunity to introduce the Church Boys United to the international stage,” says Tamang.
Bista was informed about this during the league, which came as a surprise to him. 
“We put in a lot of effort, but some other team will get to take part in the tournament that we should have been able to take part in,” he said.
However, the club’s President, Rai, remains optimistic and states that the club will work towards obtaining the AFC licence so this does not happen again.

Erroneous border pillar placement plagues Nepali farmers in Madhesh 
","L-R: Dal Bahadur Kunwar and Manju Rawot Photo: Chandra Bahadur Ale 
On May 29, Manju Rawot and Dal Bahadur Kunwar, participated in the Tenzing Hillary Everest Marathon, one of the toughest marathons in the world, for the first time. But when the two sprinted ahead of the pack, no one could tell if this was the first time the two were running a high-altitude marathon in their career.
Leaving Jumla, Manju Rawot and Dal Bahadur Kunwar just wanted to have fun and compete in the famous race. But Kunwar finished second in the male category finishing the race in under four hours while Rawot finish first in the female category finishing the race in 5 hours and 25 minutes shocking everyone, even themselves.
So how did the two manage to perform so impressively in the marathon? The answer lies in their training, hard work and determination.
Strong roots
Dal Bahadur Kunwar Photo: Chandra Bahadur Ale 
Manju Rawot and Dal Bahadur Kunwar are products of Karanali Sports Club, established by Hari Bahadur Rokaya, one of Nepal’s best marathon runners. This club has a notable track record of nurturing talented athletes like Sunmaya Budha, who has been participating in numerous races internationally and consistently securing podium finishes.
Here the two learnt pace, timing, diet and endurance. In addition, both of them acquired additional running skills, which developed their ability to compete against the country’s top athletes.
The guidance and training provided by their mentor Rokaya in the remote high-altitude regions of Karnali province gave them an advantage, which was evident during the Everest marathon.
Despite struggling with altitude sickness and fatigue, they two showed everyone what a positive mindset can do when it comes to running in the Himalayas.
“The training there is rigorous and we can’t thank the club enough,” says Kunwar.
At the club, they engage in two types of training sessions, six days a week from Monday to Saturday. One focuses on pacing while the other focuses on distance covering. During the pacing sessions, they would run 20 kilometres on the track, while the distance-covering sessions involved running on trails in the hills and forests.
“We run five hours every Saturday and get Sundays off,” says Rawot.
Born to run
Manju Rawot Photo: Chandra Bahadur Ale 
Manju Rawot and Dal Bahadur Kunwar career trajectory, however, has been different. Rawot, 21, started running as early as 13, while Kunwar only started running a year ago.
Rawot caught people’s eyes after creating a national record in the President’s Running Sheild. Soon she was training under Rokaya. She trained with the club until she was in school after which she stopped to get a job and take care of her family.
“It is hard as a girl. Society talks a lot when we do what we love. They said that as a girl, I had to follow the norms of the society. I did not want my family to be disrespected so I started to look for jobs to help my family,” says Rawot.
But she knew she was made for running and after a hiatus of a few years, Rawot made a comeback last year at the Jumla Rara Ultra Marathon.
“Running is in my blood. Winning the ultra marathon made me believe in my ability once again,” she says.
Like Rawot, Kunwar, 22, was also born to run. Despite starting his running career just a year ago, Kunwar has already participated in and won several marathons. He achieved podium finishes in races like Jumla-Rara Ultra Marathon, Guerrilla Ultra Trail Race, Pokhara Fishtail Marathon, and many more.
Kunwar wanted to join the Nepal Army and even attempted the trials two years ago. While he successfully cleared all the physical tests with ease, unfortunately, he did not pass the written exam.
Disappointed in not being able to get into the Nepal Army, he also ran the Jumla Trail Marathon in July 2022 finishing second. That for him became a turning point as he has not looked back since.
“I ran for fun and came in second. I then wanted to test myself and joined the Karnali Sports Club,” says Kunwar.
Started from the bottom, aiming for the stars

Despite facing numerous challenges, the Manju Rawot and Dal Bahadur Kunwar from Karnali have achieved remarkable success, bringing pride to both Karnali province and their club, Karnali Sports Club. Their accomplishments stand as evidence that individuals can excel in sports and become leaders, even when hailing from underdeveloped regions with limited infrastructure and practice opportunities.
Rawot expresses gratitude to her family, acknowledging that without their support, she would not have reached this point in her athletic journey.
“They told me to do what I love. I am thankful to them,” she says.
Kunwar too feels that family support is integral to their success along with the role of the Karnali Sports Club. 
“This is a team effort,” he says.
Now Manju Rawot and Dal Bahadur Kunwar want to take a leap out of Sunmaya’s book and compete in races abroad. They feel they are ready and given how they have been able to do so with limited exposure and resources, the two feel if they get the right kind of support, they can participate and even win these races.
“Our goal is the UTMB. If we continue to work hard, I believe we can do it and maybe one day win a major race and make Nepal proud,” says Rawot."

Regenerative Braking in EVs: Advantages, Disadvantages and Common Misconceptions 
","Salina Shrestha has dedicated 14 years of her life to playing volleyball. Photo: Chandra Bahadur Ale
Salina Shrestha, the volleyball player, always stands out when she steps onto the court. As a libero, she wears a distinct jersey and standing at just 4 feet 9 inches tall, she is noticeably shorter than most of her fellow players which sets her apart from others on the team. 
Despite the generally perceived benefits of height in volleyball, Salina Shrestha has proven that it does not hinder her performance. She has been involved with the national volleyball team for five years and in that time has won two titles, showcasing what hard work and resilience can do for a player.
She was key to Nepal winning the silver medal at the 13th South Asian Games. Her performance during the recently concluded CAVA Women’s Challenge Cup Volleyball was of note too as she was dubbed the best libero showing how far she’s come in her career.
Now, Salina Shrestha wants to continue to improve in her craft as she hopes to end her career with a few more international titles to her name.
Trailblazing journey

This was not the first time she has been awarded the best libero as she won it during the CAVA Senior Women’s Central Zone Volleyball Competition in 2021. While her earlier achievement showcased her talent, this particular award on home soil added a deeper level of significance for her.
“I feel proud. There were some great women and being called the best of all of them is a great feeling,” she says.
Not winning the title, however, has left a bad taste for her as there were high expectations going into the tournament given Nepal were defending champions. This year’s competition proved to be challenging, primarily due to the presence of two formidable teams—India and Kazakhstan. The strong presence of these teams added to the intensity of the competition, making it a tough battle for Nepal to defend their title.
“We gave it our best. It does not feel good to lose but we are proud of ourselves,” she says.
Small in stature, mighty in spirit
Since joining the national team four years ago, Salina Shrestha has established herself as a prominent libero in Nepali women’s volleyball. Photo: Chandra Bahadur Ale
The tournament was tough for Nepal but the team showed significant improvements primarily in defence which had been the team’s Achilles heel. 
“We can still improve our defence and get better at blocking and even serving,” she says pointing out areas where the team can focus on to become even more formidable in these aspects of the game.
One thing the team lacked during this tournament was practice. The team had a new coach in Belgian Jan De Brandt. But in the three months that he was with the team, they did not play a single practice match before the tournament.
Despite that, Nepal easily defeated Kyrgyzstan and Bangladesh in their first two games but lost to rivals India in the final group game which showed where the team really stood.
“We played a good game against India but lost key points. The coach made us believe in ourselves and that showed in the game against India. We cannot wait for the Asian Games,” she said.
Salina Shrestha has dedicated 14 years of her life to playing volleyball. Her contribution in establishing New Diamond Club as a dominant force in Nepali women’s volleyball has been instrumental. Her skills and leadership played a significant role in the club’s success and rise to prominence in the sport.
Her leadership took the team to a new height as it soon became one of the most liked teams in Nepal. They were so good, they even gave departmental teams like Nepal Police and Nepal Army a run for their money.
Her journey into the national team, however, was not as straightforward.
Long road to success
Despite consistently performing well in domestic volleyball, Salina Shrestha had to wait a lot to represent the national team. Photo: Chandra Bahadur Ale
Despite consistently performing well in domestic volleyball, Salina Shrestha had to wait a lot to represent the national team. The disappointment of not being able to secure a spot on the team weighed heavily on her, especially after being called to training camps for the selection of the South Asian Games in 2016 and the World Championship the following year. The emotional impact of these experiences affected Shrestha deeply as she wanted to test herself at the highest level.
From 2013 to 2016, Shrestha’s defensive skills consistently left everyone in awe. Whether it was her remarkable technique, agility, or unwavering determination, her defence was all people in volleyball talked about.
“Salina was like a robot,” says Kumar Rai, coach of New Diamond Club.
After experiencing disappointment from being left out of the national team, she finally got a deserved call-up in 2019. The team was quite balanced too and Shrestha feels lucky to be a part of the team that won an international title and came in second in the South Asian Games.
The national women’s volleyball team underwent several changes in 2019 for the CAVA Central Zone Senior Women’s Volleyball Competition. The tournament provided an opportunity for many young players to showcase their talents and represent the team including Shrestha. And she did not disappoint as she stood out as the sole libero during the Central Zone Volleyball Competition held in Bangladesh in 2019. 
“I was nervous at first but later after entering court everything felt right,” she says.

After a four-year wait, Salina Shrestha finally had the chance to prove herself on the international stage. That also coincided with Nepal winning their first international competition which also earned her a permanent place in the team. 
Since joining the national team four years ago, Salina Shrestha has established herself as a prominent libero in Nepali women’s volleyball. Throughout this time, she has not been challenged. Shrestha’s abilities and consistent performances have solidified her status as a standout player in her position, making her an unrivalled presence in Nepali women’s volleyball when it comes to the libero role.

Queer art festival: Reflecting and imagining the power of collaboration in Nepal 
","Despite winning the Prime Minister’s Three Nations Cup, Nepal are not seen as a contender for the SAFF Championship.
Nepal’s national football team has left for the Philippines to play a friendly match before heading to Banglore, India to take part in the SAFF Championship.
In previous years, the team has always approached the tournament aiming to win it. However, this year things are different.
Despite being the former runner-up, the football team has no goal. With a team seeing a sea of change, it is almost certain the team will have a hard time during the tournament. 
The inability to establish themselves as a strong contender in the South Asian region can be attributed to three primary reasons.
Players leaving the country
Nepal footballers Dinesh Rajbanshi and Tej Tamang before they fly to Australia in January 2023. 
In the past year, a large number of players have migrated abroad. While the All Nepal Football Association (ANFA) does not have official data, it is estimated that around 80 to 90 national team players have left the country for a better future abroad.
This affected the recently concluded A Division League but its greater impact is on the national football team as it disrupted the balance within the team which was reflected in their performance during the Prime Minister Three Nations Cup held in Kathmandu in April.
Nepal needing a last-minute goal to draw with Bhutan was a testament to how far off the team has come since the last SAFF Championship when it reached the final for the very first time.
Captain Kiran Chemjong got emotional when ask about the increasing exodus of players during the farewell program held for the team on June 11. He expressed his sadness over how players felt compelled to leave the country as they saw no future in football.
“Players leaving in the middle of the league season is disheartening to see. When I hear news of friends I’ve played with for so long leaving, it pains me. I often ask what the future holds for me,” he said.
He says it was about time the government and relevant sporting bodies did something to address this issue.
“If not, more will go and what happens to the national team then,” he said.
Poor preparations
File photo
The SAFF Championship starts on June 21. But the team only started preparing for the biggest football tournament in South Asia on June 11. Prior to the tournament, the team will play one friendly match against the Philippines before taking on India, Kuwait and Pakistan in the group games.
Due to the delayed conclusion of the league on June 10, the head coach Vincenzo Alberto Annese faced challenges in organising a training camp for the national team for the SAFF Championship. The lack of planning from ANFA and the reluctance of A Division Clubs to release players further hindered his efforts to execute his plans effectively.
Teams usually need a month of training before taking part in a major tournament. However, Nepal’s team will have gotten together a week before the tournament with only one friendly match under their belt. In addition, with the team relatively new, Chemjong understands it will be challenging.
“It is going to be hard. We have had no time to understand each other’s game so I cannot say what will happen in the SAFF Championship,” he said.
Tough competition

In a bid to improve the quality of the SAFF Championship, the federation invited two teams from the Gulf region Lebanon and Kuwait. While this move is expected to elevate the overall level of competition, it has also pushed Nepal’s title aspirations further away, considering their inadequate preparation for the tournament.
The South Asian teams will face tough opponents in Lebanon, ranked 99th in the FIFA rankings, and Kuwait, ranked 143rd. Considering that Nepal have not beaten India since 2013, the team beating Kuwait and a changed Pakistan in the group stage is highly unlikely.
“The tournament as a whole is going to be great thanks to Lebanon and Kuwait. We have not had the best of preparations but we will give our all,” said Chemjong.

","As untouched and less discussed as the sports management industry is in Nepal, it has ample room to showcase creativity. Photo by Miguel Bruna on Unsplash
In 2023, Barbie named Women in Sports as their career of the year.
Whenever I am out and about socially, there is always someone who seems pretty certain about not considering my profession as mainstream. Hold up! Sports as a career? In Nepal? You bet! This article aims to explain why women in this male-dominant sports industry in Nepal should not be viewed as a surprise.
I have been part of the Nepali cricket industry in a private capacity for quite a while now. Armed with a Master’s Degree in IT from an American University, my choice to stick with sports management tends to raise eyebrows. While I am not an on-field player, I am definitely behind the scenes, playing strong games of serious deliverance with my team. We are all about creating what is not there.
As untouched and less discussed as the sports management industry is in Nepal, it has ample room to showcase creativity. Being a commanding woman in a position can be challenging, but on the brighter side, the gender advantage has yet to fail me. As alien as I might be in sports management in Nepal, I have been accepted with open arms. The nature of the job is highly competitive, no doubt.

Women in sports are safe, heard, and welcomed. I absolutely relish the addition of spirited women to the team. The nuances of sports are something women complement greatly. Sports management inherently rejects narrow minds. There is a lot of travelling, meeting people, experimenting, and remembering limitations. The adjustments are both trivial and clever. 
Often, in our part of the world, societal norms limit women from making career decisions, hindering them from living life on their terms. This restriction potentially keeps many capable women from pursuing the sports industry, where they could truly wield their power to make an impact. Change is gradual, and I hope to see numerous female faces in charge of stadiums someday in Nepal.
Yes, there are challenges. It ranges from personal sacrifices to job security and opportunities. However, these are workable factors for any freelancer in sports management. The key is excelling at our jobs to thrive anywhere. 
Taking a page from the medical field, the seriousness we apply there should not differ in sports management. Sports is a powerful industry. Children grow up idolising what we showcase on TV. As glorious as the game is, it is every child’s dream to represent their country someday. Carrying that responsibility is our role in sports—an often thankless yet deeply satisfying job.
Nepali sports industry
The fans went wild at TU Cricket Ground after Nepal beat UAE.
Sports may be a smaller industry in Nepal, but globally, it is a behemoth. The world economy has shifted, and it is time we alter our perspective to recognise the potential of sports as an industry in Nepal. The idea of open commercialisation of sports remains somewhat unexplored, as it continues to be a more exclusive affair in Nepal. 
By sourcing innovative ideas, there’s a wealth of public attention and investment waiting to be tapped into, along with numerous practices to establish and discard. As the Nepali team achieves international records, the packaging of the sport becomes everything. There is plenty to learn from international sports management to make our industry highly marketable and poised for global entry.
Sports such as cricket, football, volleyball, or even golf serve as key intersections for reshaping Nepal’s global narrative. Over the years, Kabaddi has witnessed a substantial surge in India, both in terms of viewership and commercial success. The primary challenge we grapple with is Nepal’s comparatively small market size, posing constraints on our ability to generate substantial economic gains. Therefore, there is unanimous agreement on the imperative for Nepal’s sports to venture onto the international stage.
Nepal boasts many hardworking individuals, yet achieving this goal demands specialised talents in sports management with the requisite experience and the capacity to enhance existing values. In the long run, outsourcing such talents may foster dependence. Hence, a concerted effort is needed to inspire Nepali youth to engage in sports management, contributing to our sports ecosystem. 
There are various ways in which we can harness the potential of sports for our benefit. Encouraging youth involvement can be instrumental in capitalising on the multifaceted opportunities presented by the sports industry. There is a lot to explore if you think about it."

","Painting ‘My Private Life’ by artist Priyam Pradhan at the exhibition Mani at Siddhartha Art Gallery, Baber Mahal. Photo: Chandra Bahadur Ale
Using Pitt’s artist pen on paper, artist Priyam Pradhan presents My Private Life, a showcase of the current significance of his life depicted in abstract form.
At the centre of the painting is a 1000-rupee note, within which Pradhan has intricately painted Lord Krishna, a man wearing a hoodie tenderly embracing his dog, and a woman. The woman stands tall, elongated in form. Towards the bottom of the canvas, a holy man reaches out his hands, appearing to be in flight.
Priyam Pradhan has used a vibrant colour palette, incorporating bright hues such as pink, orange, and yellow, as well as green, black, white, and grey. This combination adds a dynamic and lively quality to the artwork.
“The man in the centre is me and the girl in green is my girlfriend. And the faces are my mom and dad,” says Pradhan. “The sadhu (holy man) symbolises my desires that I don’t have many desires for materialistic things however I do understand the value of money.”
The use of colours, figures and lines in an abstract form in his painting resembles the painting of American painter Paul Jackson Pollock. Like his abstract expressionism, Pradhan has expressed himself in his painting.
Furthermore, this marks Priyam Pradhan’s third solo painting exhibition titled Mani (money), inaugurated on January 17 at Siddhartha Art Gallery, Baber Mahal.
In his previous exhibitions, Pradhan’s artworks centred around Hindu philosophy and his spontaneous thought process. However, in this latest exhibition, he explores the theme of money and its impact on an individual’s life, delving into the reverberating effects of financial aspects.
Understanding the value of money
Paintings by artist Priyam Pradhan at Siddhartha Art Gallery, Baber Mahal. Photo: Chandra Bahadur Ale

Any form of art is known as a reflection of the contemporary time. Likewise, Priyam Pradhan’s paintings reflect the lifestyle, desires, obligations and more of today’s younger generation living in urban areas in Nepal.
Pradhan himself is in his 20s and he has justified the want of most of the youngsters in their 20s, who might be declared adults and understand the need for money and materialistic things but are still kids at their heart who want to explore and experience life as much as possible.
The exhibition has 27 paintings which Pradhan took around nine months to complete. According to him, while he was travelling the idea that his life was luxurious and him being capable of exploring anything he wanted to was because of money.
And being an artist this concept lingered on him and he was compelled to create on the theme of money.
Once you enter the gallery, you can also view an animated video, which introduces artist Pradhan and the importance of money, which is on the ground floor. On the first floor, a huge painting (193×62 in cm) Apatkalin Awastha using mixed media on canvas welcomes you and other paintings are small in size (18×30 in cm).
“It is a team work and it is my introduction as an artist for the exhibition,” he says. “Also, being a recent multimedia graduate from Islington College, I wanted to explore my skills and I got my team. Then, like money, multimedia is relevant to current society.”
Experiencing life through art
Painting by artist Priyam Pradhan at Siddhartha Art Gallery, Baber Mahal. Photo: Chandra Bahadur Ale 
Priyam Pradhan says enjoyment is the meaning of life and he enjoys creating artwork. Moreover, Pradhan who came into the art world first being a tattoo artist feels blessed that he has the privilege to explore whatever he likes in his life.
He also believes that the philosophy that says one should not be materialistic is wrong. “If material things are not important, why would one build a house? And after building a house why do they want to decorate their house?” he questions.
Alongside, money and materialistic things, his paintings also explore love, romance, life and childhood experiences. Motifs like Pokemon, ramen noodles, animals, dancers, etc have been used in his paintings. In most of his paintings, he has used numerous white lines in wavy form and these lines for Pradhan indicate the sound or the energy that exists in the surroundings all the time.
About using a pitta artist pen, he says, “I have enjoyed drawing and painting since my childhood and using a pitta artist pen helps me revisit that feeling of happiness and sense of freedom.”
So many things happening on the canvas with the use of vibrant colours gives a sense of excitement to the viewers. Though referencing artists like Pollock, MF Husain, Picasso and more, his pen strokes give a sense of newness through his expression and thoughts about his life experiences.
In his paintings, these bright colours and motifs are in harmony and are visual treats that can surely cheer up the mood of any visitor. Moreover, you can also get free stickers from the artist.
If you too are in a gloomy mood and want to uplift a little, visit the exhibition that continues till February 6."

Nepal’s mighty libero: Salina Shrestha’s unmatched tenacity in Nepali women’s volleyball
","Entrepreneurship education is not just an investment in the education system; it is an investment in the nation’s future prosperity. Photo: Pexels/ Rodnae Productions
In the shadow of the towering Himalayas, Nepal faces a challenge that rivals the steepness of its mountainous terrain- the challenge of economic development. As the nation earnestly pursues its Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), it becomes increasingly evident that a transformation in the education system is not only necessary but also urgent. 
Rooted in common living strategies, the prevailing education model, especially in higher education, may not adequately prepare the youth for the demands of the modern world. 
In this critical juncture, the incorporation of entrepreneurship education emerges as a beacon of hope, offering a pathway towards a self-reliant and prosperous Nepal.
Time to reevaluate the education system
Nepal’s journey towards economic prosperity has been marked by challenges that demand innovative solutions. The commitment of the SDGs reflects not only a global responsibility but also a domestic imperative for sustainable development. For this, it is high time to reevaluate the education system in the country.
The current education system in Nepal, deeply entrenched in common living strategies, has been the foundation of learning for generations. However, in the face of a rapidly evolving world, today’s generation aspires for more than the status quo. The call for independence reverberates through the aspirations of youth who seek a curriculum fostering critical thinking, innovation and entrepreneurial skills.
Entrepreneurship education is a dynamic force capable of reshaping Nepal’s educational landscape. This innovative approach moves beyond traditional learning methods, providing students with the tools to navigate the complexities of the modern world. At its core, entrepreneurship education is about empowering students to implement learned information in practical and tangible ways.
Consider a student engrossed in the intricacies of sensor systems during a science class, entrepreneurship education transforms this theoretical knowledge into practical applications, inspiring the creation of a sensor-operated door. Such innovation born from a fusion of science and entrepreneurship becomes a valuable mindset in solving practical problems.  
Expanding the horizons of entrepreneurship education, let us delve into chemistry. Imagine students studying chemistry not just as a theoretical subject, but also as entrepreneurs in the making. Armed with entrepreneurial principles, these students can tap into Nepal’s rich biodiversity, exploring market demands for products derived from local plants.
In the scenario, chemistry students could embark on a journey to develop performance-enhancing products based on market demand, harnessing the potential of indigenous flora. What makes this approach remarkable is that it does not necessarily require sophisticated machines or extensive human resources. Instead, it leverages the inherent skills and awareness of individuals within the community, paving the way for a grassroots economic revolution.
Entrepreneurship in education 
Representational graphic. Image: Freepik
The beauty of entrepreneurship education lies in its universal applicability. It is not confined to science or chemistry alone. Consider an art student, for example. Through entrepreneurship education, they can understand what art to develop (product), how much to set the price (price), where to sell (place) and how to sell (promote) their artworks. Every subject becomes a canvas for innovation and enterprise.
Moreover, entrepreneurship education is a powerful equaliser, recognising the unique skills and talents of individuals across various disciplines. It is not about fitting into a predefined mould but rather about unleashing the potential within each student. When every single person is aware of their skills and potential, they can rise to different levels, contributing to the overall progress of the nation.
Entrepreneurship education goes beyond skill recognition; it is about nurturing the ability to produce goods and mastering the art of marketing. Returning to the example of the student developing a sensor-operated door, entrepreneurship education not only equips them to produce the product but also teaches them how to navigate the complexities of marketing it to potential users and clients.
The impact of entrepreneurship education extends beyond individual success stories; it reverberates through the entire nation. A generation equipped with entrepreneurial skills becomes a driving force for economic growth and independence. They will be able to recognise the resources and ideas to utilise them to reach the global market. They will be able to be the pioneers in products and contribute to the economy. By fostering a culture of innovation, creativity and self-reliance, Nepal can reduce its dependence on external sources and strengthen its economy from within.
In essence, entrepreneurship education is not just an investment in the education system; it is an investment in the nation’s future prosperity. It is a transformative force that has the potential to shape a generation of independent thinkers, innovators and entrepreneurs- the architects of a self-reliant and economically vibrant Nepal. Entrepreneurship education, by teaching students to utilise available resources (physical and financial) and make them commercial, becomes a cornerstone in the nation’s journey towards economic empowerment and independence."

Unprepared Nepal brace for challenging SAFF Championship campaign
","Ram Bujhaun Yadav with his land ownership certificate stands near a border pillar which he says was erroneously placed on his land. 
In October 2023, when 51-year-old Ram Bujhaun Yadav of Musaharnia Rural Municipality-5, Mukhiyapatti, Dhanusha, was at a relative’s house, someone told him that two Indian Sashastra Seema Bal (SSB) personnel were looking for him.
Anxious, he rushed home wondering why they were looking for him.
“They asked me if the paddy field in the no man’s land was mine. I told them yes and they asked me to cut down the paddy immediately,” he said.
The paddy was not ripe and Yadav asked them for some time. However, the SSB personnel told him he had to cut down his paddy immediately.
Ram Bujhaun and his wife Tetari Devi each own a 677-square-metre plot of land. As Nepal and India reevaluated the border, Ram Bujhan’s land was been deemed to be near the no man’s land as it now has two demarcation pillars.
Frustrated, Ram Bujhaun cut the paddy before it was due to be harvested. Now, he has been asked to not plant anything on the land as it falls in the no man’s land.
“Our border police don’t say a word. I can’t fight the SSB on my own,” says Ram Bujhaun adding he had decided not to plan anything on the land anymore.
Woes of the farmers
Many farmers in southern Nepal say their land has now been placed in India after the recent demarcation. 
When the Jamuna River, which flows through the no man’s land between Nepal and India, changed its course some two decades ago, some border pillars went missing. Locals say these pillars have now been placed encroaching on Nepali land.
In 2018, with the then Chief District Officer of Dhanusha, Pradeep Raj Kandel, and an official from Madhubani district, Bihar, India, a team that included border security forces from both countries, the Armed Police Force of Nepal, and SSB of India began placing border pillars after land measurement by technicians.
Locals have raised concerns, stating that border pillars have been positioned, encroaching approximately 50 to 100 meters of land into Nepal compared to the previous position. Many like Ram Bujhaun are unaware of when these border pillars were placed.
“I did not know that pillar was placed here. After I found out when I asked the village leaders, many said they were placing the border pillars as they pleased,” said Ram Bujhaun.
He was told to carry on planting paddy and that it would not matter as these issues had happened in the past. 
“They encroached on my land and have asked me not to plant anything. This is gross injustice,” he says.
Ram Bujhaun’s family owns a total of 4,000 square metres of land, with 2,000 square metres belonging to him and the remaining 2,000 square metres to his brother Bechan. However, 1,000 square metres of his land is now located on the Indian side after the demarcation. Despite this, he has been farming on the land and continues to pay taxes to the Department of Land Management and Archive in Nepal.
“They have marked my land to be on the Indian side and placed border pillars on it. I’ve been farming till now but I don’t know when they will ask me to stop,” he says.
Ignorance of the government
The Madhesh province in southern Nepal
The former ward chair of Mukhiyapatti Musharniya Rural Municipality-5, Ram Naresh Yadav, said that over time, India has encroached on numerous Nepali lands in various locations in the Madhesh Province. This, he says, happened due to the Nepali administration’s ignorance and weak stature.
“They (Nepali administration) were careless and that meant the Indian side placed these border pillars by encroaching on Nepali land,” says Ram Naresh.
He said that over 40 farmers from wards 1, 5, and 6 have land ranging from 300 to 1,600 square metres on the Indian side. 
“These farmers have land ownership certificates, but they cannot farm as the SSB says the land is in India and not Nepal,” said Ram Naresh.
In 1996, land ownership certificates were distributed after surveying the land in the border area. Local Dharmendra Kumar Yadav said that since then, the locals have been paying their land tax regularly. In 2018, when the pillar was being placed, the locals protested when they saw their land was being encroached on. However, since the demarcation had been agreed upon by high-ranking government officials of Nepal and India, the farmer’s voices went unheard.
“We tried to stop when the border pillars were being placed on our land. But the administrators from both sides forcibly put it there without even trying to hold a discussion,” said Harish Chandra Yadav. 
The Chief District Officer of Dhanusha, Chakrapani Pandey, says that the border pillars were placed by the technical team after the measurements and with the agreement of the high-ranking officials of the two countries.
“The fields and houses that are built in no man’s land have recently been cleared. No one can do anything in this particular area,” said Pandey. “We understand the people’s concern but we cannot do anything about it now.”"

Electric four-wheelers and two-wheelers are being launched almost every month, spanning from passenger to commercial vehicles. Electric transportation appears to be an emerging trend in the automotive industry.
New EVs are regularly introduced with advanced features as car companies develop unique electric platforms. One standout feature is regenerative braking.
Regenerative braking was first introduced in 1967 by the American Motor Car Company (AMC) in their prototype electric vehicle, the AMC Amitron. However, Toyota became the automobile manufacturer to implement regenerative braking system (RBS) technology in their Prius series hybrid vehicles in 1997. Toyota brought up the new hybrid technology in the Prius when fuel prices were going up at a massive rate.

But what is regenerative braking? There are still many people confused about what it is, whether it is safe or helpful in fuel economy in hybrid cars and the regeneration of electricity in electric cars.
In simple terms, regen braking is when a car saves energy by recharging its battery when you brake, helping it use less fuel or electricity and go further. Easy but scientifically, regen braking is a process used in vehicles where the kinetic energy produced during braking is converted into electrical energy through an electric motor acting as a generator. This electrical energy is then stored in the vehicle’s battery for later use, reducing energy wastage and increasing overall efficiency.

Regen braking can be seen in all kinds of EVs, including cars, scooters, commercial vans, buses, bicycles, three-wheelers, and rickshaws. It now can be electrically managed to what extent the power and braking can be generated. 
Regenerative Braking work process in EV

Principle of Operation: Regene braking works by turning the energy from slowing down into electricity.
Electric Motor as a Generator: In EV or hybrid cars with regen braking, the motor changes roles from moving the car to making electricity when you brake.
Switching Polarity: When you brake, the motor switches directions, turning energy from the wheels into electricity instead of using it to move the car.
Generation of Electricity: The turning wheels make the motor produce electricity, which goes to the car’s battery.
Power Electronics: Special electronics change the electricity from the motor into the right kind for charging the battery.
Battery Charging: The electricity made during braking charges up the car’s battery, storing the energy for later.
Integration with Hydraulic Braking System: Regenerative braking works with the regular brakes, blending them for smooth stopping.

Advantages and Disadvantages of Regenerative Braking 
The advantages are listed below:

Energy Efficiency: Regenerative braking efficiently captures the kinetic energy generated during braking, effectively reducing energy wastage and contributing to a more sustainable driving experience.
Extended Range: By using the energy that would otherwise be lost during braking as heat and sound, regenerative braking helps to extend the driving range of electric vehicles in instances such as travelling downhill. 
Reduced Brake Wear: Regenerative braking minimizes the strain on traditional braking components, mitigating wear and tear, and potentially extending the lifespan of the braking components such as brake pads, rotors and brake lines, thus reducing maintenance costs over time.
Enhanced Driving Experience: Regenerative braking provides a smoother braking experience and a more responsive feel to drivers, enhancing overall driving comfort and control on the road.

The disadvantages are listed below:

Limited Effectiveness at Low Speeds: While regenerative braking efficiently recaptures energy during braking, its effectiveness diminishes at lower speeds which leads to decreased energy recovery compared to higher speeds.
Complexity and Cost: Implementing regenerative braking adds complexity and cost to vehicle systems, potentially raising manufacturing and maintenance expenses, and impacting consumer affordability.
Maintenance Requirements: Regenerative braking systems require periodic maintenance and calibration to ensure they operate optimally.
Efficiency Variability: Regenerative braking may exhibit variability in efficiency under extreme weather conditions or on certain road surfaces, leading to fluctuations in overall energy recapture and impacting the vehicle’s efficiency.

Misconceptions

Fully Recharges Battery: Some mistakenly believe that regenerative braking fully replenishes the battery, but in reality, it only adds a modest amount of charge.
Increases Braking Distances: There is a misconception that regenerative braking extends braking distances, but it enhances braking performance by complementing traditional brakes.
High-Speed Only: While more effective at higher speeds, regenerative braking still functions at lower speeds, such as during city driving or stop-and-go traffic.
Maintenance-Free: Despite requiring less maintenance than traditional brakes, regen braking systems still need periodic checks and maintenance to ensure proper operation.
Significantly Boosts Range: While regen braking contributes to extending the driving range of electric vehicles, its impact is influenced by various factors beyond just braking efficiency.
Only for Electric Cars: Although commonly associated with electric vehicles, regen braking systems are also found in some conventional vehicles, particularly those aiming to improve fuel efficiency with advanced technology.

Regenerative braking might sound complicated, but it is pretty cool. Think of it as a way for EVs and hybrids to recycle energy when they slow down. Instead of just wasting that energy, regenerative braking turns it into electricity, which can then be used to power the battery."

As the gates to the vet clinic at the Central Zoo in Lalitpur opened, more than two dozen photojournalists thronged the facility and surrounded a metal cage aiming their DSLR cameras at a snow leopard inside.
“Please don’t come close to the animal,” the zoo’s vet, Radha Krishna Gharti, told approaching photojournalists. But in the gush of excitement to take exclusive photographs of the elusive cat, difficult to spot even in its prime habitats, there were few takers for the word of caution.
Nepal’s Department of National Parks and Wildlife Conservation (DNPWC) organised the photo-op two days after the male subadult cat, which was until recently found in the country only at altitudes higher than 2,000-6,000 metres above sea level, was brought to the zoo from Urlabari town(146 m above sea level). According to the department, the animal has sustained injuries to its right foreleg and cannot stand upright.
Although officials involved said they are looking at releasing the animal into the wild after it recuperates, doing so will be a daunting task, adding that the zoo may be the only place where it can now survive.
Not a wild cat

“Nepali snow leopard experts have come up with two hypotheses to explain how the animal from the mountains landed up in the plains,” said Sharad Chandra Adhikari, member-secretary at the National Trust for Nature Conservation (NTNC), a semi-government body that manages the zoo in Lalitpur, a town in the Kathmandu Valley. 
The first of the two hypotheses made public during the photo-op-cum-press conference, is that it was raised in captivity and somehow managed to escape into the wild. The second is that it lost its orientation while trying to establish its territory after separating from its mother.
Kulbhushansingh Suryawanshi, director of the India program, Snow Leopard Trust, said that both hypotheses are plausible explanations as to how the snow leopard got to the plains in Nepal.
A DNPWC official, who wished to remain anonymous as he is not authorised to talk to the press, said that it was more likely that the animal had been raised in captivity. 
“The way it sipped the water and ate the food zoo staff offered indicates that it may have been raised in captivity,” the official said.
Snow leopards are shy cats living at extreme altitudes in the steep mountainous areas of 12 countries in Central and South Asia. Their global population spread over altitudes of 500-5,800 m, is estimated to be between around 3,900 and 6,000 as detailed coordinated surveys of the population in the range countries are yet to be carried out. In Nepal, their population divided into three blocks (eastern, central and western) is estimated to be between 301 and 400.
Adhikari from NTNC said that researchers will now examine the animal’s scat to analyse its diet and try to find out whether it was roaming in the wild or had been in some sort of captivity. Researchers are also preparing to analyse its genes to try to find out to which of the three metapopulations in Nepal it belongs. They will also observe the animal’s canine teeth and fur to look for clues.
Relocation challenge

The whole process could take a few months to complete, and summer could set in in Kathmandu by then, officials concede. 
“The current temperature in Kathmandu is suitable for snow leopards, as we are in the peak of winter,” said Madhu Chetri, a snow leopard researcher from NTNC. But that could change as spring season begins in the Northern Hemisphere.
The DNPWC official said that regardless of the findings related to how the animal got to Urlabarli, the animal would have spent a significant amount of time with humans during its recovery phase. “That would mean that it would have gotten habituated with having humans around,” the official said.
Sending such animals back into the wild is a challenge, as they may have lost their hunting and other adaptation skills, he added. In May last year, officials at the Chitwan National Park released two rescued rhino calves into the wild, with limited success. The safety of the animals, which had gotten used to having humans around, was compromised as poachers could easily approach and kill them. Eventually, they were transferred to an enclosure in eastern Nepal away from human intervention.
Veteran conservationist Professor Karan Bahadur Shah said that rewilding the snow leopard would be a daunting task, as the animals are territorial. “If we just leave the animal in its natural habitat, it will get killed by other snow leopards defending their territory,” he said. “The best option would be to keep the animal in the zoo for the public to see.”
But Nepal’s Central Zoo has its own set of problems. The facility, established in 1932 as a private collection, has limited space and has frequently run into financial trouble. Conservationists say the snow leopard would need special facilities to cater to its needs.
“If the government decides that the snow leopard needs to remain at the zoo, we are ready to shoulder the responsibility,” said Adhikari. “We have set up special facilities for animals such as the red panda and chimpanzees,” he said. “We can do that for the snow leopard as well.”
Those advocating for keeping the animal in the zoo also said that Nepal is a snow leopard range country and the public, especially the young generation, also needs to see the different animals found in the country. “It has great educational value,” said Shah.
Snow leopard expert Suryawanshi from neighbouring India also said that it would be challenging to release the animal into the wild. 
“If the team at the zoo can establish the exact cause of this behaviour [why it ventured into the plains] and can keep the animal away from human contact, then it might be okay to release it back,” he said. “But otherwise, there is little hope for it in the wild. Better to let it live in the zoo.”
Back at the zoo, after the photojournalists are done taking photos, it is the turn of the reporters to point their smartphones at the animal. Then there is a contingent of senior wildlife department officials waiting in line to catch a glimpse of the animal. 
“So much for keeping it away from human contact,” a conservationist observing the hullabaloo from a distance said.

ANFA finally finds title sponsor for A Division league
","The National Assembly was formed to give experienced people a chance to be part of the parliament and help during the formation of important bills. In countries that follow the Westminster model of government, the upper house plays an important role. That, however, is not the case in Nepal as the country’s upper house has become a platform where individuals secure positions in the National Assembly based on their connections. As the election nears, many once again question the relevance and existence of the upper house.
Things were different in the past as the initial years of the National Assembly saw experienced politicians and experts others in their field be nominated for the post. That slowly changed as the first batch completed its two-year term.
“I understand why people are frustrated with the upper house. People expected experts but all we got was party cadres who lacked knowledge or experience,” says Bimala Rai Paudyal a National Assembly member. “Considering such behaviour and practices, what distinguishes the House of Representatives from the National Assembly?”
A loser’s second chance 
Narayan Kaji Shrestha, who faced defeat in the 2017 general election from Gorkha-2, was elected as a member of the National Assembly on January 23, 2020. Elected from Gandaki Province, Shrestha currently is the Deputy Prime Minister and Home Minister of the country.
Bhagwati Neupane who lost the election from Gandaki province and Bimala Ghimire who lost the election for mayorship in Bhanu Municipality also shared the same trajectory.
Similarly, Mrigendra Kumar Singh Yadav and Jag Prasad Sharma were defeated in the House of Representatives elections, from Saptari-4 and Dang-3 respectively are now members of the National Assembly. Bam Dev Gautam, who lost the elections from Bardiya, secured a place in the upper house through nomination by President Bidya Devi Bhandari.
Even those who did not win as ward member(s) got the opportunity to become members of the National Assembly including Sindh Bahadur Bishwakarma who was appointed on February 7, 2018. He is soon leaving his post on March 3.
Despite the repeated criticisms, the political parties have not paid attention to this concern posed by political leaders and the general public. The latest proof of this is the list of candidates for the National Assembly elections scheduled on January 25. The list contains names like Krishna Prasad Sitaula, defeated in the House of Representatives elections in 2022 from Koshi Province, and Pooja Chaudhary, who lost in the provincial assembly elections 2022 from Rautahat-3 (a).
Speaker Ganesh Prasad Timilsina, who led the National Assembly for the entire six years under the federal system, is also dissatisfied with the individuals who have made it to the upper house. 
“The allegations are something for the parties to ponder upon. The leaders should have prioritised involving intellectuals/neutrals rather than managing its members,” he says.
The 59-member National Assembly elects eight representatives, equally from all seven provinces, with an additional three individuals nominated by the President. The Constitution ensures representation of women, Dalits, minorities or disabled communities, envisioning that experts, experienced individuals, and the most qualified people from various fields will become members of the National Assembly.
Easy way in
File: A National Assembly meeting
There are some reasons why leaders aspire to join the upper house, and even the leadership create opportunities for them. 
In National Assembly elections, voters consist of local-level heads/deputy heads and provincial assembly members. Typically, individuals seeking these positions undergo a vetting process by their respective parties. As a result, aspiring members of parliament can focus less on persuading individual voters and more on gaining party support to secure their candidacy. 
Moreover, being a member of the National Assembly opens avenues to ministerial roles. The constitution prohibits a National Assembly member from becoming the Prime Minister, but not Deputy Prime Minister. Due to such opportunities, leaders are enticed to seek a position in the assembly.
The National Assembly is currently in its fourth election cycle since the promulgation of the Consitution in 2015. Scheduled for January 25, this election aims to fill 19 seats vacated by individuals completing their six-year terms. The previous election cycles took place in 2017, involving 56 members, followed by 2019 with 18 positions, and 2020 with 19 positions.
The cascading impacts
File: A National Assembly meeting
Another reason why the National Assembly is finding it difficult to justify itself is that it has become a shadow of the House of Representatives. The meeting of the National Assembly did not have one session when the House of Representatives was dissolved by then Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli twice. The demands and issues raised by the opposition parties in the House of Representatives automatically went to the National Assembly, where the parliamentarians of the ruling party put forward any proposal, they endorse it the same as in the House of Representatives.
The latest example – is the main opposition UML did not allow the meeting of the House of Representatives to continue for five days from July 5, 2023, due to a statement made by Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal during his visit to India. Consequently, the meeting of the National Assembly was also paused during that period.
The UML obstructed the House of Representatives for almost a month starting mid-July last year demanding a high-level inquiry committee to probe the 60-kilogram gold smuggling case and the resignation of the Home Minister. The National Assembly followed suit with leaders pushing their agendas forward.
Speaker Ganesh Timilsina himself is dissatisfied that every behaviour and activity of the House of Representatives influence the National Assembly. He says despite his attempts to prevent the overshadowing, it has been unfortunate that he did not garner the goodwill of the top leaders during political disputes.
Reinstating power
The National Assembly is a permanent institution. Therefore, it can remain operational even in the absence of the House of Representatives. Under normal circumstances, Speaker Timilsina initiated a positive practice by personally participating in different committees. Nevertheless, in the absence of the House of Representatives, the National Assembly often experienced inactivity.
In December 2020, the Prime Minister at that time, KP Sharma Oli, dissolved the House of Representatives. Subsequently, a session of the National Assembly was convened on January 1, 2021. Despite lasting only seven hours over four days, this session, which took place after the dissolution, failed to address crucial public issues. Even after six months, important matters remained unaddressed within the House.
On May 22, 2021, the UML-led government once again dissolved the House of Representatives. The meeting of the National Assembly and committees was affected once more. However, the dissolutions were declared unconstitutional by the Supreme Court, reinstating the parliament.
The Constitution says that despite the closing of the National Assembly session, thematic committee meetings can still take place. However, both the National Assembly and its committees remained inactive until the restoration of the House of Representatives.
According to Khimlal Devkota, a member of the National Assembly, when the House of Representatives was dissolved twice, it seemed that the National Assembly was also in a state of dissolution.
Bimala Rai Paudyal also believes that the inability to resume the upper house is a mark of weakness. 
“Since the government was not in a position to call, the President needed to be consulted by the chair together with the consultation committee. That was not done either,” she says.
Constitutional and legal distinctions

Except for the Constitution of Nepal (1962) and the Interim Constitution of Nepal (2007), all other constitutions in Nepal provided for a bicameral parliament with the National Assembly or the Upper House and the House of Representatives or the Lower House. The practices before 2015 were under the unitary governance system, but after the adoption of the federal democratic republican governance system, the role of the National Assembly has changed somewhat.
In the preamble of the constitution prepared by the ‘Constituent Assembly, and Administrative Organ Designation Committee’ during the drafting of the constitution, it is mentioned that some different qualifications have been prescribed for being a member of the House of Representatives and the National Assembly, with the intention that qualified people can be represented in the National Assembly.
Chair of the National Assembly Ganesh Prasad Timilsina restates that the members of the upper house should be assessed based on the country’s expectations with clear criteria. 
There is no definite definition of an expert in the constitution. It has been stated symbolically, “…It is expected that the members should have some basic skills to face the challenges and fulfil their responsibilities.”
According to the constitution, the responsibility of the National Assembly is to correctly establish the rights of the local level, state, and union, and to prevent the House of Representatives from trying to enact laws contrary to the spirit of federalism. There is an explanatory comment in the constitution about the propriety of the National Assembly – “This House is expected to fulfil its role to maintain creative and mutual relations between the national government and the provinces.”
In addition, there are some constitutional and legal differences regarding the National Assembly. But the MPs are demanding that it should cease. When a bill originating in the House of Representatives is passed and sent to the National Assembly, and if the latter does not decide within 60 days, it proceeds de facto.
This has placed the National Assembly in a dilemma. The Chairman of the National Assembly, Timilsina, says, “Such an arrangement should also apply to the House of Representatives, or both should be equal.”
Need for course correction 
PM Pushpa Kamal Dahal speaking in the National Assembly meeting.
Some instances have turned these so-called experts into a laughing stock due to their actions. 
On July 5, 2023,  a discussion on the Electronic Commerce (E-Commerce) Bill 2023 was tabled in the National Assembly. However, the parliamentarians misunderstood the main point and instead discussed the matter of electricity. The MPs, who had not read the proposal, suggested that electricity consumption within Nepal should also be increased besides exporting electricity to India and Bangladesh.
During the meeting, Ramesh Rijal, the Minister of Industry, Commerce and Supplies, also mentioned that India would purchase electricity during the Prime Minister’s visit. Unfortunately, the bill was unanimously approved.
Timilsina considers the incident an example, that in his six-year tenure, he does not want to remember. Som Bahadur Thapa, a former secretary at the Parliament Secretariat, termed the incident ‘a joke’ in the Parliament of Nepal. 
“This is strong proof of the kind of MPs we have, who speak without knowing what they are talking about.” 
Timilsina assumed the role of the speaker/chair of the National Assembly after the establishment of the Federal Democratic Republic. He had the opportunity to establish the system and the dignity of the National Assembly. However, instead of setting a positive example, he will soon be retiring after being accused of playing tricks with the Speaker and showing interest in the work of the House of Representatives.
Timilsina has repeatedly commented on the affairs of the House of Representatives. The latest instance was during a seminar on ‘Japan: Past, Present, and Future’ held in the capital on December 2, 2023, he publicly stated that the election results of the House of Representatives did not bode well.
Pointing to the emergence of a new party and the victory of some independent candidates, he said, “In a democracy, you get to choose candidates, irrespective of their party affiliation. However, is the signal positive?”
In August/ September 2022, Timilsina wrote a letter to the Election Commission, urging them to extend the tenure of Speaker and Deputy Speaker. Upon receiving a response stating that the Commission would not determine the tenure of the elected Parliament, Timilsina directed the Parliament Secretariat not to execute decisions made by the Management Committee after September 17, 2022.
This created conflict between the Speaker of the House of Representatives and the Speaker of the National Assembly and in the crux of this dispute between the parties, the country had to bear the consequences of this conflict. Laws could not be enacted promptly, and the place once considered the domain of experts was overshadowed by the party’s interest. 
A study conducted by the Democracy Resource Center Nepal (DRCN) on the legislative functioning of the National Assembly has revealed that the Upper House has passed some bills that go against the spirit of federalism.
The report’s concluding remarks say, “…the bills passed by the House of Representatives have not undergone significant changes or discussions in the National Assembly. The conclusion section of the study states that – “Furthermore, some bills, contradicting the spirit of federalism and addressing the interests of interest groups, have been approved by the National Assembly.”
Overall, in the last six years, parties have introduced individuals who, given their presentation level, have raised questions about the National Assembly’s justification. If there are no changes in the constitution, laws, and policies concerning the upper assembly, these concerns will persist.”"

A Division League: Church Boys United become champion in debut season

While most of the nation was preparing for the festival of lights, Tihar in early November 2023, something no less exciting was fuelling our sparks from oceans away. A queer art festival was happening for the seventeenth year and we had a chance to attend it as delegates. Our delegation was made possible through the collaboration between the Outburst Arts, an art organisation based in Northern Ireland, UK and the British Council, Nepal.
There is a clear distinction between cities in terms of their flourishing arts scenes, and this became apparent during a visit to Belfast, Northern Ireland, specifically for the Outburst Queer Arts Festival held in the charming city centre. The organisation of such a festival requires months of careful preparation and planning.
The queer art festival started as short events lasting a few days. Now, after 17 years, it has grown into a ten-day festival with panel discussions, theatre performances, and exhibitions. Program guides were available at venues, partner hotels, local libraries, and shops. Many delegates, including us, came from outside Northern Ireland to attend.
During the queer art festival, we had the opportunity to connect with art curators, publishers, artists, and representatives from other British Council departments around the world (Lithuania, France, South Africa, Turkey, Greece, Jordan, England, and Argentina to name a few.) 
Each event that we attended gave us a different insight into what the arts can do and how it can facilitate connections. We gained insights from queer publishers and art curators on the challenges they face in their own countries due to resources and sometimes from bureaucracy in systems. We also got to see the way people can thrive when given a platform to showcase their works, such as an art exhibition in which the artist reimagined intimacy for queer people.
On the other hand, Nepal struggles by and large at times for queer visibility. There are no explicit spaces for SOGIESC (Sexual Orientation, Gender Identity and Expressions and Sex Characteristics) artists to showcase their works nor openly come together as a community, it all exists in pocket spaces. In the same way, something that struck us was the presence of older queer artists at the festival. 
It was not just for one particular event during the queer art festival. We noticed an active participation and involvement of older queer people throughout the festival there. It was fascinating to see queer artists in their 40s and 50s share their transformative and inspiring work. Whereas, back home, the queer folks at the forefront of queer art, advocacy and activism are mostly Gen-Zs and millennials. We have very few queer elders that we can count on our fingers who are diligently working for Nepali queer folks. Even among them, some still hold onto archaic notions and refuse to evolve and embrace changes. So, there’s that.
From dream to reality

Before being selected as delegates, both of us joined online meetings with British Council Nepal and the Outburst representatives facilitated through Kaalo 101 (an art space in Patan), along with interested queer artists from Nepal. We had a total of three meetings where we discussed the possibilities and challenges of doing a queer art festival in Nepal. 
The discourse also entailed us sharing a presentation about the updates of the queer art scene in Nepal in the last five years. The updates included memorable leaps taken in queer arts from music to literature and fashion and more by artists from diverse walks of life. Days after the third meeting, the British Council extended invitations to us to attend the Outburst Queer Arts Festival.
Our delegation is just one example of the transcontinental collaboration because it was something that happened for the first time and involved us. But, Outburst Arts and the British Council have been practising cross-continental collaboration for years. Even in this year’s festival, we witnessed a lot of artists from different continents work together in exhibitions, lectures, panel discussions, magazines and so on. The amalgamation introduced us to brilliant thought-provoking work that defies gender and sociopolitical norms. The power of transcontinental collaboration was beyond beautiful.
Imagining queer arts in Nepal

The queer art scene in Nepal is an emerging one. While a full-fledged festival may not be possible now, something small yet significant is achievable. Time and again, different organisations have been running large art exhibitions/tours for weeks and months. However, in the microcosm that is Nepal, especially Kathmandu, the capital is no stranger to art-oriented programs. What it has been unfamiliar with precisely is queer art. And the unfamiliarity is not something induced by the lack of queer artists and their art. Sadly, it is because of inadequate platforms, space and resources to pursue queer arts.
Despite this, through the years there have been events and literature that have emerged centring on queer identity, but it has not come without its challenges. On collections of stories, “Pride Climbing Higher” and “Songs of Revolution” showcase stories from Nepalis across Nepal. There are not many stories reflecting the Nepali queer experiences otherwise. 
June Pride Parade by Queer Youth Group has gained momentum as well in the past few years since its conception, from a small gathering to now a large parade with performances from community members. The same can be said about Blue Diamond Society’s (BDS) Rainbow Visibility Pride events in August during the festival of Saa-Paru (Gai Jatra) which has been running for well over a decade; in recent years they have included flash mobs and interaction programmes as well in lead up to their parade. Individuals within the community have also organised their queer gatherings with friends, thus coming back to the cosmos of pocket spaces in celebrating queerness.
While artists like us are creative with what we want to put out, we still need organisations like the British Council to foster spaces and connections to enable us to do that. Then and again, artists have come together and collaborated on queer-centric projects. But, we need funding and resources to achieve bigger-scale projects that unite more artists and transcend borders.
Both of us advocate for queer rights and are involved in programs and activities that push the narrative further, extend the visibility of the community and normalise conversations surrounding queerness. Among other things, we are also the founders of Queering The Bond, a networking collective for Nepali queer folks and Shuby is also the founder of Queer Honky-Tonk, a platform to promote queer performances and networking with events such as a drag show or open mic every few months. However, both of us, individually or collaboratively can only do so much. 

The challenges of living in a capitalistic world oftentimes outweigh the passion we have for the queer art scene in Nepal. And this is where we expect the government and organisations to step up with policies, platforms and programs to provide spaces, opportunities and resources for queer artists. Here, the British Council joined hands with Outburst Arts, which paved the way for our delegation. We would not have known about the marvellous queer art festival at the other end of the world otherwise.
Besides the limitations brought by insufficient spaces and social unawareness, the centralised capital does hinder queer artists from outside the city to connect, create and collaborate. Art already is centralised and elitist. On top of that, the concentrated Kathmandu Valley is of no help when it comes to making art accessible beyond its borders.
Furthermore, there is also the expectation from basically everyone to have the perfect festival that caters to all people’s needs and wants. While the festival, if it should happen, is bound to be done with the right intentions, there is a lot of pressure for the first-time event itself. The festival will be inclusive and diverse. But, realistically speaking, it would be a struggle to make it relevant to each queer person from east to west.
Speaking of struggles, a visceral feeling of uneasiness swarmed over me with each step I took while exiting the airport after the flight back home. I, Birat, personally felt that I could not be as free or unrestrained in Nepal as I was during my time in Belfast. No wonder a lot of the queer people we know opt for abroad.
Seventeen years ago, when the Outburst Queer Arts Festival first began, it certainly was not as celebrated or large as it is now. What we are trying to convey here is that we do not have to start big. We can aim for something small yet promising. While there might be expectations to check all the boxes, it is crucial to be mindful of our capacity as well. But, we can be capacitated and this is where you – people in power, art enthusiasts, grant and resource allocators and media come in. It is time we all believe in Nepali queer art and create space for it to not only survive but thrive. It is imperative to understand that formulating our imagination into reality can only be possible through unwavering collaboration."

CAVA Men’s Volleyball: 3 new faces as team announced for tough tournament
","The month of January saw major road accidents in different parts of the country, including Lamhi in Dang, Dhorpatan in Baglung, and Chandragiri in Kathmandu. Road accidents have been common throughout the country with Nepal Police data suggesting over 2,500 people dying in them annually. Despite this, the Ministry of Finance has shown reluctance to introduce the proposed Road Safety Bill to reduce traffic accidents, fatalities, and serious injuries, and enhance road safety. 
Instead, the Finance Ministry has asked the Ministry of Physical Infrastructure and Transport to include the proposed bill in the Public Roads Act. Along with that, the government’s initiative to pass dedicated laws on road safety and set up a mechanism, including the empowered National Road Safety Council (NRSC), to decrease accidents, has come to a halt.
Keshav Kumar Sharma, secretary of the Ministry of Physical Infrastructure and Transport, says they asked for a dedicated road safety law that comprehensively addresses institutional arrangements was the need of the hour. This includes ensuring safety in road construction, promoting public awareness, providing training and communication facilities, implementing rescue mechanisms, and arranging rehabilitation for families affected by road accidents. However, the Ministry of Finance believes a separate law is unnecessary due to concerns about potential increased financial burden.
Hourly need

Officials from the Ministry of Physical Infrastructure allege that the Ministry of Finance is approaching sensitive matters, such as passenger safety, solely from an economic standpoint. They say that concerns related to road, vehicle, and passenger safety are being overshadowed, and there are indications that this approach will continue. 
“The government is avoiding addressing the sensitive issue of road accidents and the associated human and material costs, fearing an increase in expenses. This contradicts the government’s commitment and policy to reduce traffic accidents in the future,” says an official from the Ministry of Physical Infrastructure on the condition of anonymity.
According to the Ministry of Physical Infrastructure, the existing laws lack the vision and purpose necessary for developing a sustainable, safe, risk-free, and reliable transportation operation and security system. Therefore, the Ministry of Physical Infrastructure officials argue that a distinct law is essential to decrease road accidents and ensure the safety of pedestrians, including passenger transport workers and roadside residents, as well as pets, wild animals, and birds. 
“The Road Safety Act is the need of the hour as it will help us during post-accident rescue, treatment management, rehabilitation, and legal representation,” says the official.
Currently, there are gaps in enforcing road rules, monitoring vehicle capacities, ensuring road structure safety, managing traffic signs, and organizing road safety facilities. The implementation of the Road Safety Act is seen as crucial to address these issues.
However, there has not been a facilitative environment for providing education and raising awareness about road traffic safety, safety mechanisms, and coordinating among organisations related to road transport. The aspect of training drivers with skills and knowledge, as well as monitoring road safety on the roads, is also lacking. This is why experts have been suggesting introducing a separate road safety law to address these aspects.
The Finance Ministry, however, says that road safety should not be downplayed by ignoring human sensibilities related to road safety and citing economic reasons. Officials from the Ministry of Physical Infrastructure argue that incorporating safety considerations in the Road Act does not automatically result in a decrease in accidents or the integration of post-accident rescue, relief, and rehabilitation efforts.
“The existing laws do not address road safety anywhere. Due to its lack of clarity and inadequacy, it has not been implemented with due diligence. For instance, provisions such as those for vehicle inspectors outlined in the Transport Act have not been acted upon by the government,” says an official from the Transport Ministry.
Policies and commitments, but no laws

The Motor Vehicles and Transport Management Act (1993) includes several provisions related to vehicle registration, road permits, driver’s licenses, traffic management, insurance, and penalties. The Public Roads Act (1974) primarily focuses on road management. However, there is no provision in the Act regarding the National Road Safety Council.
In this situation, Nepal has developed a 10-year road safety action plan but is yet to enact corresponding legislation. Unfortunately, government agencies and mechanisms are not obligated to follow the action plan, as it lacks legal guidance.
Now, the Transport Ministry holds the view that if safety considerations are explicitly addressed in the Public Roads Act, the outcome will not differ from what the Finance Ministry has said. Given the Public Roads Act’s close association with the Department of Road, the ministry thinks greater emphasis will be placed on road construction. However, they argue that incorporating the road safety aspect into the Act would not be effective.
Secretary Sharma of the Transport Ministry is tasked with ensuring road safety, overseeing physical infrastructure and transport, and coordinating efforts across education, health, home, law, federal affairs, and general administration ministries. This responsibility extends to provincial ministries, local levels, as well as various agencies, organisations, security agencies, non-governmental organisations, and related entities, each with their specific roles.
“As all the agencies need to be allocated responsibilities for various aspects of road safety, we have requested them to collaborate in formulating a distinct law. This should encompass the reduction of all types of accidents,” said Sharma.
The ministry believes that a dedicated law addressing road safety is crucial to mitigate severe road accidents in Nepal and to uphold the commitments made by the country on the international stage.
Nepal has committed to implementing the Stockholm Declaration through the Global Road Traffic Safety Conference in 2020, as per the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. Nepal, which has incorporated sustainable development goals into its national development plan, has not yet commenced work aligned with these objectives.

Nevertheless, Nepal’s neighbouring countries are already addressing road safety through legal frameworks. Various states in India have enacted road safety laws, and the effectiveness of these laws is contributing to a 50 per cent reduction in road accidents.
In 1999, Bhutan also introduced a unified road safety and transport act. Pakistan, on the other hand, issued the National Highway Safety Ordinance-2000 to ensure road safety, distinct from its National Highway Authority Act (1991). Britain, Australia, America, New Zealand, and other countries have established separate road safety laws as well.
Road safety neglected
In Nepal, road safety has been consistently neglected due to the absence of dedicated legislation. Road safety expert Keshav Adhikari says that the government primarily focused on road construction, overlooks crucial aspects such as road safety and reinforcement. Consequently, roads are transforming into perilous pathways for both vehicles and passengers.
“There is a lack of interest in formulating policies and laws aimed at mitigating financial losses resulting from accidents,” says Adhikari.
He further points out that safety is not a governmental priority, as expanding the road network is perceived to yield more political benefits than implementing additional structures to enhance road safety.
“When I worked as an expert in the Transport Ministry for over a year, I realised that promoting road safety is not a government priority,” he says. “Annually, more people die due to road accidents than those who die in natural disasters, but the government has not given it much attention.”
Even though the prime minister, ministers, and MPs keep asserting that roads have been constructed, no one seems to be addressing the critical issues of road safety and quality.
Saroj Sitaula, General Secretary of the Federation of Nepalese National Transport Entrepreneurs (FNNTE), says that the government must be attentive as accidents are on the rise due to various technical and human factors, including road infrastructure. 
“Many accidents can be mitigated by improving road conditions, installing barriers on the sides, putting up informational boards, and ensuring scientific and practical road markings,” he says. “We need to formulate a plan and progress accordingly.”
Sitaula argues that the government should establish policies to create mechanisms for emergency rescue, treatment, and rehabilitation after an accident occurs. He emphasises the importance of enhancing road infrastructure, conducting a scientific examination of the technical condition of vehicles, and ensuring compliance with the law by drivers, passengers, and regulators. He says that blaming drivers and transport entrepreneurs for accidents is inadequate, and the government must fulfil its responsibilities.
Roads are unsafe

Nepal currently boasts a road network spanning approximately 100,000 km, with the majority consisting of dirt and gravel roads. Among the more than 22,000 kilometres of national and subsidiary highways, numerous sections remain unpaved.
Despite the government’s substantial investment in road construction and expansion, minimal efforts are allocated to ensuring road safety. 
Recently, all three levels of government have accelerated the widening of roads, incorporating asphalt and slopes. However, it appears that issues concerning road quality and safety are escalating at a faster pace. Roads that have been neglected in the guise of maintenance have become a nightmare for the public.
Infrastructure expert Suryaraj Acharya notes that these problems arise due to the tendency to construct roads only after they have sustained damage, without considering potential issues during the initial construction phase."

ANFA cancels national team training camp
","Ram Bujhaun Yadav with his land ownership certificate stands near a border pillar which he says was erroneously placed on his land. 
In October 2023, when 51-year-old Ram Bujhaun Yadav of Musaharnia Rural Municipality-5, Mukhiyapatti, Dhanusha, was at a relative’s house, someone told him that two Indian Sashastra Seema Bal (SSB) personnel were looking for him.
Anxious, he rushed home wondering why they were looking for him.
“They asked me if the paddy field in the no man’s land was mine. I told them yes and they asked me to cut down the paddy immediately,” he said.
The paddy was not ripe and Yadav asked them for some time. However, the SSB personnel told him he had to cut down his paddy immediately.
Ram Bujhaun and his wife Tetari Devi each own a 677-square-metre plot of land. As Nepal and India reevaluated the border, Ram Bujhan’s land was been deemed to be near the no man’s land as it now has two demarcation pillars.
Frustrated, Ram Bujhaun cut the paddy before it was due to be harvested. Now, he has been asked to not plant anything on the land as it falls in the no man’s land.
“Our border police don’t say a word. I can’t fight the SSB on my own,” says Ram Bujhaun adding he had decided not to plan anything on the land anymore.
Woes of the farmers
Many farmers in southern Nepal say their land has now been placed in India after the recent demarcation. 
When the Jamuna River, which flows through the no man’s land between Nepal and India, changed its course some two decades ago, some border pillars went missing. Locals say these pillars have now been placed encroaching on Nepali land.
In 2018, with the then Chief District Officer of Dhanusha, Pradeep Raj Kandel, and an official from Madhubani district, Bihar, India, a team that included border security forces from both countries, the Armed Police Force of Nepal, and SSB of India began placing border pillars after land measurement by technicians.
Locals have raised concerns, stating that border pillars have been positioned, encroaching approximately 50 to 100 meters of land into Nepal compared to the previous position. Many like Ram Bujhaun are unaware of when these border pillars were placed.
“I did not know that pillar was placed here. After I found out when I asked the village leaders, many said they were placing the border pillars as they pleased,” said Ram Bujhaun.
He was told to carry on planting paddy and that it would not matter as these issues had happened in the past. 
“They encroached on my land and have asked me not to plant anything. This is gross injustice,” he says.
Ram Bujhaun’s family owns a total of 4,000 square metres of land, with 2,000 square metres belonging to him and the remaining 2,000 square metres to his brother Bechan. However, 1,000 square metres of his land is now located on the Indian side after the demarcation. Despite this, he has been farming on the land and continues to pay taxes to the Department of Land Management and Archive in Nepal.
“They have marked my land to be on the Indian side and placed border pillars on it. I’ve been farming till now but I don’t know when they will ask me to stop,” he says.
Ignorance of the government
The Madhesh province in southern Nepal
The former ward chair of Mukhiyapatti Musharniya Rural Municipality-5, Ram Naresh Yadav, said that over time, India has encroached on numerous Nepali lands in various locations in the Madhesh Province. This, he says, happened due to the Nepali administration’s ignorance and weak stature.
“They (Nepali administration) were careless and that meant the Indian side placed these border pillars by encroaching on Nepali land,” says Ram Naresh.
He said that over 40 farmers from wards 1, 5, and 6 have land ranging from 300 to 1,600 square metres on the Indian side. 
“These farmers have land ownership certificates, but they cannot farm as the SSB says the land is in India and not Nepal,” said Ram Naresh.
In 1996, land ownership certificates were distributed after surveying the land in the border area. Local Dharmendra Kumar Yadav said that since then, the locals have been paying their land tax regularly. In 2018, when the pillar was being placed, the locals protested when they saw their land was being encroached on. However, since the demarcation had been agreed upon by high-ranking government officials of Nepal and India, the farmer’s voices went unheard.
“We tried to stop when the border pillars were being placed on our land. But the administrators from both sides forcibly put it there without even trying to hold a discussion,” said Harish Chandra Yadav. 
The Chief District Officer of Dhanusha, Chakrapani Pandey, says that the border pillars were placed by the technical team after the measurements and with the agreement of the high-ranking officials of the two countries.
“The fields and houses that are built in no man’s land have recently been cleared. No one can do anything in this particular area,” said Pandey. “We understand the people’s concern but we cannot do anything about it now.”"

Life is filled with surprises and unexpected events and it can change at any moment. The only thing certain in life is the uncertainty. Change is a natural and inevitable part of our lives, and it may be positive as well as negative.
Even though it is not guaranteed that we will wake up in the morning, we set the alarm every night with the hope that we will wake up in the morning. We do not know what each day is going to bring us, but we may have varieties, adventures, and endless opportunities.
The push to explore
The uncertainty sometimes forces us to explore those aspects of life, we never knew existed or needed. It also tests the mental strength of people and how they deal with it. The uncertainty has taught me to be grateful, as we never know what life throws at us.
In life, everything does not go according to our plans, and if we do not embrace the change we will face huge trouble. The Covid-19 pandemic is the best example of uncertainty, we were constantly fearing death and it was uncertain that we would see the sunrise the next day.
It is not certain that every decision in life will be correct, but if you fear not trying at all, you miss endless opportunities for learning and growing. When our decisions or outcomes are on the negative side, we get depressed and we might tend to think about committing suicide, but we forget that if we have life we have endless opportunities. 
Most of us plan for our careers, our love life, etc. and when those plans do not work out we start getting uncomfortable. But if we can deal with today, we can surely deal with tomorrow. We need to cherish little moments in our lives and know that nothing is permanent not even the failures and setbacks.
We come here with nothing and leave with nothing. So why should we hold the egos and grudges against each other? Instead of making our life meaningful and enjoying the journey of life, we get into puzzles of accumulating wealth and we go against our own loved ones for it. 
Change is certain

Nothing is permanent in life, everything can change in fractions of seconds. In today’s society, everyone is so busy, that we people have so less time for our loved ones. What I have learned over the years, is to find time in our busy schedule for our family because we never know when it will be our last day together with them. 
Yes! Death is a natural process, so if you have to die someday, why should you die with grudges in your heart? But instead of worrying about the inevitable, focusing on the things you can control will bring a lot of happiness in life.
Uncertainty is not only a negative thing; it also brings a lot of opportunity because you dare to change. The life-changing experience will not come knocking down your door, you need to expose yourself. We learn by doing and experimenting, even though we might fail. But that is not the end of the world. I still remember hesitating while applying for the role of leadership, at my school level as it was not certain that I would be chosen.
Even after being selected, I was uncertain about whether I could fulfil my responsibilities or not. But that uncertainty helped me grow out of my comfort zone and give my best input. If I had not applied for that role just because I was uncertain of the outcome, I would miss the biggest learning opportunity in my school life. So, do not let the uncertainty or the unknown ever stop you from trying and no matter how much we try, to plan life always finds a way to surprise us. 
It is important to stay grounded when we have everything we wish for because life can take such a turn that we had never expected in our wildest dreams. Similarly, nothing is permanent in life, the financial hardships, the grades, the breakups, etc. But the most important thing is not to lose hope during those difficult times.
According to the data provided by Nepal police, around 6,830 people took their lives in the fiscal year 2022/23. There is nothing in life that cannot be resolved although it may take time, committing suicide should not be an option. It’s important to share feelings among family members or loved ones because together as a family any problem can be overcome.
Embrace the unknown and focus on enhancing your life, instead of worrying about what will happen next. Always find time for your loved ones, as life is uncertain. We should be grateful that we are alive and accept that change is the only constant thing in life. Do not let the unknown, stop you from trying or achieving your goals and always remember that even if you fail, you still have endless opportunities."
